i think these are very important considerationsit seems to be necessary to consider if this should become a project supported also financially if necessary by and made for those who want it not only from the current eve base as other interested people could be those who maybe left when incarna was cancelled as well as some of the potential future subscribers that way it shouldnt be problematic for ccp to go ahead with itthere should in this respect be very regulated links between eve and this using isk aurum and plex should maybe be the only link items bought in the wis setting should only have real relevance in this setting though they could be sold in the market in eve and then be used by another person who have or plans to get access in this setting or if it is apparel be used in the character customization that exists already in evefinancially if this was to be up front player financed i would prefer to support ccp directly instead of through another platform like kickstarter then the money could be used more efficiently and also not on lawyers personally i want to give ccp all the creative freedom they want because i really like how they do things so personally i wouldnt need for my opinion to be heard even if i contributed personally i wouldnt mind if this were to be a paid expansion of the equivalent of between what it costs to get between 12 plex from the plex store very likely i would buy items from the wis in game store as wellthis would be a new project with the potential for a lot of new features which of course would be related to incarna but i dont think it is reasonable to assume that the devs dont want to continue this project it is not possible to know thati dont really have a reply to the lack of developers question maybe when legion is ready some of the developers there could work on this project if there is enough support also financially they could maybe hire more people
the fundamental problem of fozziesov is as followsits not fun its not fun to attack a 1x system its not fun to attack a 6x system its not fun to defend any systemthis is a game it should be fun instead i spend my time doing sov related stuff playing other games do you really want a game where the primary nullsec experience is alttabbing and playing another game
that will not happen if you stop attacking empty spaceeven a 6x system is now quicker to take than in domi sov its just your trying to use domi sov tactics and ships to do it
i was looking forward to fozzie sov but last 2 weeks been most boring in 7 years playing eve
except were not orbiting nodes on alts is not fun orbiting them on mains is less fun its only quicker when you consider the additional timer actual time commitments are immensely longer than in dominion sov
isnt that what it already wasUFFFDsome capsuleers claim that ecm is dishonorable and unfair jam those ones first and kill them lastUFFFD  jirai fatal laitanen pithum nullifier training manual c yc104
previously through judicious use of capital ships you could reduce the boredom to mere minutes now the boredom is a predetermined amount of orbiting nodes playing world of warships
i would ask how many systems are you taking to live in tri has 1400 people in 22 corps so how much space do you needif you are taking more than you need i would have to ask whythe whole sov system is designed to make it a bit easier to carve out your own home but much much harder to take and hold more than you need so why are you trying to take more than you could possibly need even if you were 2x the size
its not about the sovereignty or holding the sov its about getting people to fight as it is now the most effective way to get your opponent to go away is not to fight them its to force them to afk on nodes with alts while the rest of the fleet says  this im going back to insert staging system heredefense now is about stationary objects in space which dont shoot back which use boredom as their primary tool of dissuading the enemy from engaging
as an fc thats currently abusing all of these mechanics to our advantage i fully agree with the need for all these changes and points that uaxdeath brings up being able to set entire regions on fire and making defenders have to deal with thousands of nodes due to 2050 trollceptors sent from several regions away without any intention or commitment to taking the sov were attacking is horrible gameplay for everyone involved it just happens to be 510 times more horrible for the defender than it is for the attackerthe system is currently extremely broken and the current consensus between a lot of groups seems to be that the best way to deal with fozziesov in its current state is to not care about it at all
so your way of getting people to fight is to create so many timers that you hate making that there are for sure not going to bother fighting
the only people complaining are the people that dont live in their spacearent competent enough to defend their space
if you beat that dead horse any harder its going to turn into a pulp
it should have been pulped before it ever made it livewe were forced to retaliate by trolling insmother after they trolled the spire
1 for original post
realtydid they come over to your house put a gun to your head and say entosis 600 things all nightor did you at the time before the 1st entosis cycle think it would be super funny to troll entosis all there space in one go
there are no nodes to deal with when you defendif you are dealing with nodes then you are doing it wrong nodes only appear if you allow reinforcementit takes 3 people per system tcu ihub station to defend against trollceptors during the vulnerability window
it seems to be promoting skirmishes but not battles i would be concerned about the missing half of the equation if i was ccp
battles will happen when people stop trolling and make a serious push at actually capturing a new area of spaceof course battles dont happen if all you are doing is trolling around the edges of someones sov

cant help but smile when i read the list of alliance in the opplease enjoy this nice bbc article on what they have dubbed the majestic arctic unicorn
signed on a personal level as a compromiseproblemfozzie sov is contrived you wave a wand that has a fixed cycle time you can not augment your ship to improve damage and grind the structure down you can not augment your ship to repair the structure fastershoot the hairy potthead fan who loves waving wands aroundsolution cut carrier and dreadnaught dps by 10 heavily nerf titan and super carrier dps roll back to dominion sov and cut the hit points off the structures that you no longer needadditionally find a way to hard limit how many supers and titans an alliance can have active in a system or regioncauses for the stagnation no space for small independant corporations and alliances to grow big enough with the super  titan fleets to contest for space the ships were the problem not the structures now you have ruined sov for sub capitals our sov has gone from building castles out of stone to building it out of plastic it feels cheap nasty and childish catering to giggly little griefers that have too much energy and no patience
tldr owners of the largest renter empires in eve are in a tizzy because they hold massive swathes of space that nobody uses in dominion nobody could contest the empire at all now theyre complaining that they might actually have to do something to hold onto their space
check reddit it is not only xxdeath it is many other people from all over null secinteresting phoebe saw much change and fragmentation before and afterfozzie sov is seeing fewer and larger coalitions
things will be fine when people get used to the new sov equation the essential problem is that people have delusions of old grandeur when an entity that could field a decent sized fleet could hold a region or more forget that in this new regime the maths are going to look more like thiscall a cta in your prime time how many do you get consistently 50 100 200 500divide that number by 20 thats probably about how many systems you can hold try to take more than that and youre going to have a bad time get yourself established in a realistic amount of space bring in some indy types if you dont want to mine and stuffs once you are well established you can pewpew with your neighbors youll have a good time if you get big enough use the number you can get in a cta so you dont bs yourself take some more spaceyoure going to have to adjust your expectations to the new reality the new reality isnt going to adjust to your expectations that used to be realistic but arent anymore
 have fleet battles will now have silly little gang  solo spats that could be better done in low sec if that is your style of playing the game
little early for this since most people dont even understand fozziesov yet
i agree with a few of the pain points made but strongly disagree on othersspreading fights out between systems was part of the original design of the aegis sov system to avoid creating a chokepoint where all battle activity must happen on one node and to better use the resources of the server cluster housing new eden when we look at large scale battles like br5rb 6vdth and hedgp they are remembered for their scale but those who actually participated remember the sub 10 tidi lag and 2022 hour slogfests large blocs are quick to cry out that these battles are what gives eve the best publicity but we know that many of the pilots drawn in from these do not experience these type of epic battles and leave due to incorrect expectationsi strongly disagree with this and im slightly amused by the large nullsec blocs comparing sov trolling to player harassment requiring gm tickets htfuentosis is designed to influence the type of ships brought to contest nodes as little as possible there may be some extreme cases that need to be dealt with but there are viable counters you can bring to most of these situations a 12kms vagabond orbiting the beacon at 250km park a t1 frigate with a t1 entosis module on the beacon and pause their progress or hunt down their links ship and kill it instead right now a 1m isk griffin can jam out that ship and force them to go through the warmup cycle again or a maulus can damp down the vagabond to lose its lock at that range and force it to come in closer if adm indexes are raised for the systems owned it will take 40 minutes to reinforce a structure  giving lots of time to form up and chase off the invader the increased adm will also result in a lower vulnerability window so there is less time the defense fleets will have to be vigilant and thats the point of occupancy sov  if you are living in the space and raising the indexes youll be able to defend it before the structures go into reinforcedas for roaming gangs im finding entosis a great way of encouraging fights it is creating content and a more vibrant nullsec rather than roaming through regions of empty space where ratters and miners pos or dock up as you come through we can provoke a reaction and get a good fight if the residents would rather not form up then theyll have a lot of timers to deal with in the next few days and risk having someone come and 3rd party it some good examples of this
i would also agree with this sov ownership shouldnt feel like work and cleaning up uncontested nodes should be able to be done with a minimum amount of effortone suggestion i would have is if no parties show up to attempt to capture any of the command nodes the original owners can run through one entosis link cycle on the original structure to defend it if any parties attempt to capture any of the command nodes this progress pauses otherwise once completed the structure goes into a defended state is invulnerable until the next days vulnerability window and all command nodes disappear without having to be individually captured no complaints about this optimizing the information received through the notification system or via crest would both be very helpful similar to how dominion and pos structure attack notifications would show you the corporation or alliance attacking that is valuable intel which will help determine your response without having to send a scout to confirm for every notificationi completely agree with this in fact i posted about this in the sov little things thread i think we need a lot more micromanagement with the sov structures themselves being able to drop sov and unanchor to reclaim tcuihub rather than exploding them also we need a way to micromanage ihub upgrades as we are only allowed one per system now and currently you cannot remove or onlineoffline specific ihub upgradesi would like to see the ability to turn offon individual ihub upgrades as long as it is not being reinforced having the ability to unplug and move unneeded upgrades would also be helpful  so we can recoup some cost if those upgrades arent needed or we want to strategically reposition them
it is not the strongest of the species that survives but the most adaptable to change  charles darwinany change to any system within eve will come with those who win from the changes and those who will lose from the changes i would like to point out that all the signatories to this post are the powers of old those who adapted to the dominion sov system and built their empires using the tactics and strategies that worked for that system and those times they are obviously the ones losing out on the new system but does that make fozziesov a bad systemi would ike to offer a counter perspective as a new alliance taking sov in nullsec for the first timewe the corvos were determined that we would not become a part of a coalition when we made the move to sov null many of our leadership had been involved in sov before but we wanted to own our space in our own right ours to hold or lose on our own merits we made some allies but no supercoalitions with blues for 30 jumps so far we have been able to hold off much larger groups with better ship comps and numerical advantage by adapting to fozziesov small teams 23 pilots have been able to effectivley stop the enemy gaining any control whatsoever sure we havent won every fight but we have been able to maintain our sov without simply being forced to face the enemy head on we can fight hit and run gurella style deny the enemy pilots their f1 pressing sessions while giving our own pilots invaluable small gang experince as we destory entosis ships and their escortsfozziesov has allowed us as well as many other smaller independant groups to compete in the sov game of course it is no wonder the empires of olde are unhappy they lose out on this their weaknesses of old are now gaping holes in their battle plans their pilots and fcs will need to change if their alliances are to be able to survive no longer are fights decided on one single massive engagementindividual pilot skill matters a small team of commited and experienced pilots can hold off or at least delay a larger forcebig f1 pressing fests are not what every player wants i want to be able to mid fight take command of a small detachment of a larger fleet and hit enemy positions and eliminate enemy entosis ships and their escortsif you cannot adapt to the new system you will die and those who can adapt and survive will take your place at the top of the food chain you will not be able to have massive afk empires that noone can ever threatenwelcome to fozziesov boysthis isnt to say its perfect uaxdeath does make some good points such as not having to clean up uncontested nodes but with ccps new release cycle they will be able to monitor and change the system as it needs but the system as a whole is great if the powers of old are complaining its an indication that fozziesov is workingand to ccp keep up the good work
there is a huge gap between high sec and null sec while low sec is not bridging that

this was a touted feature and is easily seen by any alliance member in the alliance sov tab as indicated by the phrase overtime which means a structure has been partially entosisd and the vulnerability is in overtime this was also acknowledged by fozzie on the 5th reply on the original sov thread and he said they are working on a method to elegantly transfer sov there is no need to keep pinging on a core feature that imo they know they left out and know is needed
quality opnice to get eastern european voices in on this
sorry im late there was a huge line at the the popcorn stand
thats doing it right
none whatsoever furthermore garst tyrell has signed this rmt rental whine without any kind of mandate from the alliance and he is acting here as a single player and as such his personal opinions in no way represent the official stance of triumvirate alliance
it is working as intendthere are no sov wars ongoing in eve or just some small scale local fights for not much important systems or taking space undefended almost 3 weeks spent in the new system and its visilbe that if you not live in your space your defense multiplier will be close to 1 and you can easily lost the system you shouldnt own regions without manpower and ppl living out there thats the pointas someone already mentioned earlier the new system prefer the preventing defense so if you live there your defens multiplier is high then troll ceptors will need 60 mins for reinforce anything in a 3 hour window and your primary interest to defend yous space preventively so kill that damn ceptorwell if you not live there you deserve to lose that space the old style renter empires are over goons already adapting instead of typing wall of text on forum
you wouldnt be able to do that if they live there its works as intend you can say its not sweet but still work as planned from my view just try to entosis some cfc systems where ppl live around you will see the difference comparing with the south rus empty space
yes to reducing the number of nodes if they are left uncontested no to regroup them next to a contested structureyes even have them automatically revert to the defender if left untouched for a whileyes speed reduction is a must for entosis ships and make sure entosis forces a value commitment to the action and not be done with worthless hulls like the ridiculousness of rookie cyno shipsabsolutely not local intelactivity and scouting must be a thing and not being spoonfed informationmakes sense1
didnt you guys have like 350 nodes to contest just the other day
well said and bravo to your alliance good sirkeep on doing it right
 or they could have just prevented the reinforcement in the first place and have 0 nodes to deal with and if they couldnt be bothered to do that then why would they bother to deal with the nodesfacepalm
literally a rogues gallery of rmt
1 thoughtful and true post
occupancy bonuses are something ive always been advocating for just beacuse thats a facet of the current system doesnt mean the system as a whole isnt utterly flawed and designed for one side of any sov conflict to bore the other one to tears without any kind of meaningful fleet engagements ever happening which is honestly the biggest problem with fozziesovs design theres also quite a difference between having decent defensive bonuses tied to occupancy and using your space and any systems you dont mine or rat in for a few weeks to be able to be burned down by a handful of people in trollceptors at almost any given time
can you please rationalise why proper discussion of eve is done better on a 3rd party site rather than the official general discussion forumyou cant
oh look another nullsec group who enjoys telling everyone to htfu when change happens to highsec and lowsecand now a balanced balanced nullsec change occurs andout come the giant alligator tears and cries of this sucks this is aids this is ruining game playno its made it so groups like yours cant own hundreds of nullsec systems that sit empty and unused ccp wants you to defend your land cant figure out how still cant your problemhtfu only keep what you can defendadapt or leave null simple as that
i love the fact rental alliances have signed this
can you please justify gimping legit combat fits with entosis link even when it is only specific denying fits that is the problem
wow claim discrimination against null sec that joke rightwhat needs to change here is way of thinking they need to stop claiming sov on those systems that they dont use this will drastically reduce the entosing example the big populated systems in cfc have had no attempt to entosisbesides some obvious attempt to get you to fight you wonder why cos they are heavelly populated if you look at the systems that are been attacked they are systems that have either no people or very few people in it so example cfc needs to stop claiming those systems they dont use and therefore cant defend cos of the absurd amount of timers this will cause much much less entosis timers mittani tried to counter this not by releasing systems but instead they tried to fill them up with renters it has not worked the new sov system was created to give greater chance for smaller entities to gain space and force the large ones to realease those systems they dont really usestop blaiming fozzy sov or ships or other mechanics for your inability to hold a system which you obviously cant defend cos its stretches you alliance activitiesentosis defence way too much pull back and release those system for other entities the same way that the new sov was meant to be utilised dont and suffer the consequencesprior this i want to ask how many big fight happened in the last year not much cos most of these entitties did not really fight each other one coult speculate cos they got some kind of agreement and the blue donut was born the big fight will happen no matter what i seriosly think it will cause a lot more animosity cos now you will have to relase systems you cant really control now who gets those systems and what will they do with them very interesting stuffbig battle will certainly happen when important systems will be contested sov is still new and everyone is learnign from mistakes and succescess of others and themselves everyone is watching
dunno what dream you are dreaming but keep dreaming while you dream that dream my alliance is holding an entire region and we have nowhere near enough dudes to be active in every system yet outside of the imperium nc  pl you cannot take it from us sure as hell you can rf some systems and even take some but can you actually life there no you cannot wed probably even let your  alliance number 1209 take a station wait for you to get settled and once you do wed crush you with a hammerthe new sov system does not change the fact that power is power just because you can take sov does not mean it is viable the mare presence of a superior capital and super capital force is more than enough to keep full control of a region
throwing the gold apple in you dont use it for mining and ratting so you are not using it and deserve to lose it this makes it easy for small alliances to get some space seems to be the general counter argument1 said many times there is more than those two ways to use systems2 easy into space easy out these systems are honey traps and make delicious snacks for the huge estabilished alliances to farm and feed uponthis is not some amazing equality mechanics it is annoying for defenders who are griefed and it is devastatingly crushing for the naive
straps into her seat and slaps a helmet on popcorn in handoh ho ho this thread is going places and i am ready for the ride
jeeez learn 2 think it not too hard to get the solution from rental to extortion and just get a bigger coalition than your neighbour  problem solved
that would require being able to make credible threats
1 where is popcorn2 do you have salted caramel popcorn 3 i 3 new sov
because you dont care about it thats why you love it for people who dont care about it and all they care about is griefing potential the new system sure is amazing no denying that now if that makes a good system thats a different question entirely
this is funny coming from someone who has no sov and does nothing but fly troll ceptors weve tried fighting nulli all weve found is they run away even faster then darkeshii have nothing really against the idea of fozzie sov but its just so broken and lopsidedmy suggestions for fixing it everyone who has sov has somehard cap the speed of etosis ships t1 1000ms t2 1500msif no nodes are being attacked the defender gets 5 back ever hourdone fixed maybe then well get some fights out of this joke instead of experiencing world of cowards
i love fozziesovits so good we should allow it to affect all stations and structures in all of new eden at the very minimum ls and npc nsi mean its great right everyone should be given the opportunity to love fozziesov in game by promulgating it everywherein all seriousnessits boring fozziesov is boring to defend and it is boring to attackfozzie and his team have replaced one type of grind with a more horrible type of grindccp has allowed the rise of a juvenile level of play with fozziesov that in the end will cause major power blocks to become bigger and stronger ccp continues to ignore and understand the human condition and how it affects the sandbox making game mechanics that run counter to that tide only destroy a gamethe best quote i have heard from a member of an entosis fleet this is worse than miningthat saidi think everyone should be given the opportunity to adapt to a horrible and boring mechanic
imo fozziesov is awful and basically undercuts alot of what was unique to eve it shouldnt have been implemented and it should be rolled back
to those who say that you should not claim more than you can actually occupy  i can hardly see any changes regarding the number of sov holding alliances after the fozziesov in other words  the sov change was intended to make people actually go and capture 00 space but someone had forgotten that its actually held by big nullsec alliances that will protect it and it actually doest matter if someone will claim some god forgotten system anywhere in space  those guys wont be able to live there cause the same big sov holding alliance will sit in it 247 andor just pop any incoming ships i think the correct term is power projection thats why we have what we have and such changes as fozziesov will never change it ccp has to understand 1 simple thing  people come to 00 for blob warfare so the only thing they have to change is to create something worthy to fight for currenly sov itself brings no such benefits r64 moons for example are not sovdependent at allso i would like to support the op and ask ccp to respect the hours that nullsec players had spent capturing all that they have and stop that crap with entosisinties been there done that 20 minutes to rf a station in a lone intie  really  at least make the same as siege mechanics speed 0 pg  cpu depentent bc  bs size etc etc
so it takes some getting serious if so that demonstrates the flawed base of this system i know everyone hated dominonsov i didnt like it either but in that system and the pos spam system before if you had to come in serious in the 1st place if you wanted to do anything with sovthe focus of this sov system is off and one of the side effects is that it does produce boring cat and mouse skirmishes rather than encouraging people to actually fight this gives big groups the ability to wear smaller groups down even easier than in dominion sov already im finding it harder and harder to join up with a fleet because i kow its going to be a hour or two of chasingkilling ceptors and fighting slippery pete tengus or hit and run but not serious about sov tornado or t3d gangsits just not fun at all im amazed at how fozzie group could take something fairly grindy and boring dominion sov and its structure grinding and make it more boring mininglasersov fozzie said in an interview that it was between this system and a kind of sovless sov from where im sitting they chose wrong sovless sov might have been way better than this current experience ccp iterating on this system will simply be the act of polishing a turd
sure enough but whyofc you can keep doing what you are doing but burnout will be realthats not to say that current system dont have to be tweaked but gotta face what we have right now
i personally believe that some nullsecs are unable to do fozzie sov because some out there in our game dont even have maps and i believe that our education in the new system like such as in scadling pass and the thrium reach and everywhere like such as and i believe that they should practice sov when the lowsec and pvp comes to take it our education over here in the nullsecs should help the nulls and should help nullsecs understand the need of small fight and not big and should help the future and the rus renter allices so we will be able to build up our future for our children play new eves fozzie sov and make greater battle but smallerthis is the future where no more big renter blib and no crying change it and threats not welcomed at all said
for emphasis i think this is the motive behind most of the noise supporting fozzie sovps glasgow learn to ascii
i have nothing to do with sov living in lowsec but you have my axe and my merry band of men
as a casual pvper i have to say this last month has been the absolute crap experience since the old pos spam days i would rather have dominion sov back over this turd fozzie has is essence head shotted all of null sec in one patch went from finding gangs of roaming t3 cruisers bcs and other things in enemy space to only finding interceptors galore and t3 destroyers all the good fights have died out i think we need to force all the ccp employees to join a new alliance out here in null sec and troll ceptor the  out of them
i can understand that people dont like change and that those notifications popping up all the time might be annoying but hey were you actually using those systemsdominion was stagnant tedious and mostly just a painyoud have a target or two reinforce it or them wait and then blap it all very nice if you like reading or have a show you can watchnot much difference between taking sov stations poses or pocosthen comes fozziesov still not finished as far as i can seeyeah it needs tweaking but hey its ccpits a race and exausting but having sov isnt suposed to be we dont use the system but cyno in the capshey if you actually used the system and it is under attack you would know who what and wherealso wait for it its you sov you defend itapologies for ranting slightly but contiuing on most of the points by op are mostly mewling that the safety of dominion sov is no longer there they can no longer sell or buy systems oh and renters can nab the sov if they so please after all its them using not youto conclude i believe that fozziesov is here to stay though tweakedyours rambling slightlyhinamori tsesuda
yes we are now try think of all the ways that we do that arent mining or rattinggive you a hint to start you off there are other infrastructure hub upgrades
so any way now that the buggy whip manufacturers have vented their pwecious feewings about allowing those nasty horrible automobiles on the roads
yes its very obvious that a larger entity with supers can evict a smaller one aegis sov wasnt meant to alter that the question is whether youll be able to handle mentally the challenges to your unoccupied areas see the earlier post by emma kado on corvoss tactics if you enjoy the process of capturing command nodes and can avoid getting burned out from it more power to ya o7
not an empty quoteits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka
so i saw two of the most frequent opinions 1 you crying about your rentrmt empire 2 you doing it wrong adaptwell lets see in factsfact 1 only one who can say they doing rmt this is ccp if it says someone else its just unsubstantiated allegations as coceo i spend for my alliance 200 per month for characters hosting licences and other stuff i have good job and i dont need rmtfact 2 in last half of year we gave 45 of space for friends allies and small alliances who wants to try themself as sovnullsec players space for free for free carl and process continues year ago all this space was under rent when i read that the petition is aimed for preservation rent empire i laugh like philip philipovich in novel heart of a dog this is absolutly wrong fozziesov just boring and exhausting mechanics  that a pointabout adaptation we i mean gemico first had two weeks of new sov war i wrote full and detailed report about one of them on russian forum few days ago translation can be found here we prepared doctrine plan and changed fleet behaviour what we got hours of rat race in summary of two weeks we spent 22 hours got 3 fights hitarun rat races i was coordinator and for myself i got at least 15 of files with information about nodes patrols and etc like this eve always been a game of routine but now amount of routine is max that i ever seen in last 75 years of my game in eve fortunately im a programmer and i can try to help myself me and another guy from xix made prototype in 2 days idk why ccp didnt same thing maybe they just lazy they happy cos their players not lazyconclusionwe are not against fozziesov at all new mechanics can be enteresting really small groups coordination all pilots must be much more clever and etc all it is good but mechanics have too much bad parts right now they must be fixed
you guys are stuck in the old method you got comfortable for years with sov now you have to adapt and actually work for your sovhence you are bitchinadapt or die as anything else in eve thanks for the hilarity of this post
you guy is stuck in young age and cant into text

1 
only thing i see here is russians crying that everything is on fire and they cant run their rmt empire anymore because they dont have enough people to properly hold the sov they have hell as much as i hate cfc they actually make smart decisions such as downsizing their sov count to properly accomidate their entire memberbase
aha fozziesov is ok
so the answer is we should recruit everyone with a pulse and carebear till then end of evewhy fight when you can shoot rats and rocks all day
or try holding onto only one system per 100 alliance members
are targets going to be beltratting in unoccupied systems at least there is something to engage in sov and the owning alliance gets a mail to say turn up for fightif the launcher explains that there are 2040k players online any given time and picturing that people log in  out every minute it makes more sense for people online for more than an hour to own more systems than 1100players so they can coordinate fightslogin sit in system wait for ratter on the other side of the coin is login wait to defend this is the reason interceptor entosis is not enjoyable there is no fight its literally turn up here to see an interceptor the aggressing alliance should already have enough sov for their 1100 pilot ratio 14k pilots gives 140 systems 828 empty systems what about hiseclowsecwh playersnullsec sov holders want to own more sov than they can manage to have an abundance of possible fights600bil isk is 50 years of subscription if you arent losing ships last i saw ccp had an email address for plex purchases over 300
so my alliance should hold one constellation and carebear the  out of it until we die of bordemwe arent going to get more fights that way it promotes pve to an extreme extent this change is toxic to eve we get no fights we get no fun and we spend stupid amounts of time orbiting a structure because one guy can spent 10min of his time to waste almost 2 hours of our time and we have to turn up to every single one because some moron thought it would be great to make it stay that way forever because defenders should turn up and waste massive amounts of time even if the attacker rolls eyes has no intention of turning up because why because  anyone trying to hold more then 1 system per 100 players come down here and try holding sov you piece of  and see how you like watching the guys you play the game with get less and less active and probably quit the game given enough time all because some moron in ccp had a good ideawe didnt like dominion sov but we  hate this coward carebear piece of  that replaced it
i dont care if you halve capital ship dps and tank give them a damn role already
an amusing thing about this thread is that its a repeat of the past when dominion came and its sov system hit we saw the same kind of discussionyou just dont like changeyou dont like how small groups can come in and take your stuff because you cant just spam poses anymoreyoull get used to itthe old system was stagnant this one is much better now all you have to do is shoot 1 ihub instead 20 posesits like battlestar galactica this is happened before and it will happen again mainly because some people cant be critical of a thing until theyve had 6 years of it to understand why its badgood news is the year 2021 is right around the corner
1 reduce number of nodes to 52 leave entosis fitting requirements alone but reduce the time required to complete onesided events eg no defence or no offence maybe 1 is adequate for this but if not they should degrade over time 3 reduce the effect of the sovereignty index  it should be less tedious to take space that is held but not used 4 there should also be some sort of depletion mechanic to encourage resource competition moons or convert r32 and below to depleting mining sigs
he shoots he scoressome people are on the pitch
use your space and only have a three hour window of vulnerability where attackers have to entosis for almost an hour or run around putting out sov fires for 18 hours a day while an attacker can just take ten minutes to f your s up your choiceit seems to me that you have gone with this third optionits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka
then theres the recruitment option where you recruit people to handle the carebearing for you leaving you to defend your space and attack other spacethe systems not perfect it needs work but some of the complaints im seeing are a touch inane
caps arent in the world best position right now i dont think anyone is disagreeing thereexactly what role they should have thats the interesting question if you have any thoughts id certainly like to hear them
shh dont tell them i want them crying because they have to crab to get the indexes up delicious tearstruthits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka
your issue here is that you are equating sov with fightsthe two are only tangentially related not a direct correlationtry doing other things to get fightsalso who cares if there are empty systems thats systems you then dont have to waste time with if you are searching for a large scale fight against another null alliance just go direct to their active systems with a battleship fleet wait for them to escalate then drop your own cynos hey presto massive fightor just jump a titan in with said bs fleet and watch the server go crazyif you want a big cap fight look at the actual reasons big cap fights have happened nothing to do with nibbling away at unimportant sov and troll roams those happened under the old sov mechanics as well cloaky roams almost never escalated to titan fights it was form ups over critical hub systems or a tackled titan who may have pressed jump not bridge that made the big fights so use those reasons not sov for the sake of sov
this if you are spending hours repairing the damage done when you didnt bother to defend your system in the first place then you have yourself to blamemarech
thats rich the alliance im in rents from tri and they seem to be ok with hassle free income from us renters
if people arent liking fozziesov i heard that wormhole space has plenty of unoccupied systems for people to take
i disagree with the limitations suggested on entosingbased on my observations is the majority of this large alliances althought they are very powerfull they all have the same issuethe issue is vast amount of unused space every second system its empty as a result large amount of jumps have to be perfomed this is specially true in the drone region cfc space and catch the drone region been the worst where only 3 out of 10 systems are actually in use i think its time they adjust the amount of sov systems the occupy from the ones they dont really occupy if you drop those unused space you dont have to defend it why keep sov if you dont use itwe see this all the time with the cfc we got people coming from all the corners of the globe for a 20 man fleet and they show up in 80 minimum they even bring supers and carriers the amount of jumps they are doing is too much and all because they want to keep vast amount of empty space which they clearly are having difficulty defending drop sov systems and get your numbers into the core system if you look at the systems that are been attacked the vast majority are insignificant systems cos no one lives in them aka emptyi believe the worst idea is to give zero ms speed to entosis ships why would anybody bother entosing if all you have to do is jump a titan and snipe it after all cfc has tried to do this many times alreadyi can tell you this with all sincerity we have been waiting for this changes forever now that they are here we are trully enjoying it we finally can actually herass a larger entity and pick a fight when we want and disapear into the jungle when we dont want to fight them i think now gorilla warfare has a great future in eve at the momment we have forced the cfc to reevalute their possition and hire lots of renters to keep the indexes of their systems up this is what a 1000 man alliance has been able to archive vs a 50k coalition of alliancesi only ask ccp to look at the sov systems and see how many are actually have presence or used effectively the truth is right there you are keeping systems you can not defend and expanded way too much and therefore you spend most of the night jumping way too much
i dunno man telling me to make a choice comes pretty close to cyberbullying me its a slippery slope that ends up with me being entirely to blame if i failfit my ship should i decide to keep playing hang on youre one of that personal responsibility rabble arent you ccp please stop him posting  its a form of enhanced interrogation when he keeps doing that
whilst i agreed with the bulk of your post this is just silly and i would have thought you could do better
op i suggest reading all of ccpfalcons posts in the linked threadganking in hi sec is an absolutely intended and allowed part of the game it is not bullyingposting screenshots on a public web page of in game mail and private chat including in game identities with or without the intent of belittling or antagonising might walk closer to the line however as long as it stays in character it wont be seen by ccp as bullying or rl griefing
nope 
you need to understand that people in all parts of space are there for a variety of reasons i live in null have never been part of a blob and am happy about thatmarech

the cfc actually has one of the highest player per system densities in sov null
i beg to differ go into pure blind and see you will be hard pressed to find many cfcs fade  tribute has also alot of systems as well as space around venal a lot of unused systems or has very little people in system the only real region that get alot of use is deklein and branch also its in the ratting statistics which also prove my point i know where i live after all i kill in it every day and do several roams
before the aegis expansion pure blind was really not good space most of what we have of pure blind has really bad truesec none of the good anomalies would spawn even if we ratted it up to level 5 and even then pure blind was not ours to rat in then six days before aegis hits bam fozzie drops that on us suddenly all that cruddy space no one really wanted or could use unless it had a money moon or jump bridge had a lot less suck attached to it hell people are going to be able to actually make some money in them running the anomalies not as great as with good truesec systems but decent isk none the less that last minute change caught us off guard and a few of us are trying to rectify that talk to a goonswarm rental agent today certain terms and conditions applyits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka

problem nullsec got all buddybuddy made nonaggression pacts and wouldnt fight except one staged fight per year to ensure that ccp was nullsecs bch since ccp needed that one fight for advertising purposessolution introduce new game mechanics so that smaller groups that are not part of the buddybuddy system can stir up nullsec and get them to actually defend their holdingswe can check this one off and look at nullsecs thread which should have been titled pout stomp our feet and cry like a two year old as proof of effectivenessproblem nullsec apparently cannot combat low skill pilotssolution everyone that has every been ganked by a nullsec 3 week old pilot laughs their collective asses off and decries nullsecs attitude on the subject as seriously hypocriticalproblem nullsec that has long held that ccp shouldnt be holding players hands suddenly wants theirs heldsolution stand agape at the criminal levels of hypocrisy nullsec is showing on the issue and of course laugh our asses off some moreproblem seeming exploit allows entosing attacker to move the defense windowsolution hotfix the issue because unlike the rest of this poutfest this is actually a real problem that needs addressingproblem nullsec doesnt like being annoyed while spending more than a decade doing this to the rest of evesolution i have to use the word hypocrisy yet again seriously wtf problem nullsec is so accustomed to sitting on their collective asses they cant be bothered to go collect intel on an agressorsolution do nothing but at the same time wonder out loud why the f were game mecahnics in place that would allow these lazy asses to hold sov for so long when it has become abundantly clear that they dont deserve their holdings problem alliances want to work together in close knit cooperative groups again like the good ol dayssolution repeat oft used nullsec mantra frequently heard when highsec didnt want some change put into the game adapt and htfu yawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really

death star is a good start for a role
no working together in close knit cooperative groups is the solution
i dunno it just doesnt have the same righteous retribution for your high sec crimes vibe which is needed
these guys are doing it right up until pl and the imperium hell camp every single one of their systems and break them in one swift and brutal campaign which will be made even more brutal when stations can be destroyed however i like what i am seeing so far and that people who control space without using it are complainingmany of the russians alliances operating around stain still have a ton of people doing missions in stain they should be kicking them to work on the admedit one thing i want to say on this is that a lot of those alliances need to create a buffer zone of systems and stations to get around the hell camp risk from one of the super powers that is their additional cost so to speak i am also interested to see just how far from the npc areas pl will move for a campaign will be interesting to see and a final off topic comment good catch to the initiative on that ncdot move i have always had a certain level of respect for the initiative blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
pvesov the hero we deserve
so guys lets have 20200 unoccupied systems we cannot realisticslly cover and lets moan when we have to do something to defend themfozziesov is fundamentally right it just needs some tweaks defend the systems where you live dont care about the systems where you dont live seems like people tend to freak out when they cannot have millions of empty systems for rentingi feel that only a couple of alliances actually bothered to think further than muh rentals really
you are repeating what i already mentioned abov about the drone region having the largest unoccupied space cfc still has lot of space unoccupied and that forces them to do vast jumps if it wasnt they will not be coming from decleinbranch to pure blind wether the space is good or bad it does not make a difference you do not live in pure blind so makes it useless having to defend it if you want to keep them fine more entosis for me but dont whine then when you got to do a lot of jumps to defend make up your mind you cant have everything favouring your side you got to make a choice and select what space you want to keep and if the space is too far then it may not be to the best interest to protect specially if you dont live in it which is my point i love gorrilla warfare and entosing is a really big plus for usentosis has really given birth to gorrilla warfare which i think its fantastic i feel like we are going back to the old days of small numbers war which is very opposite to the piling up in a system of as many people as possible to make sure they have loaded the grid first and obtain the advantage that way and win large battle will happen no matter what
but the point that is being so graphically if unintentionally illustrated by this thread is that sov space will now belong to the people who want it enough to keep fighting for it pl may well come visit them sure how long will they stay and fight for it
mordus ceptors ehmake the most of trollsov
all the last 7 systems we entosed were corm fleet get it right  its not troll sov its called guerilla tactics and not letting you breathi entosed one in a cruiser the other day and attempted to get a second
has anyone lost a their capital yetor is just systems in the middle of nowhere that defenders have no presence
wouldnt passing sov to another entity give a 7 day invulnerability boonif so eek how simple to make it impossible to take that space as 6 days and 23 hours after the first transfer you just push it back to the original owners for another 7 days invulnerabilityid sooner there was zero ways to sneak that in
yes you are right i do not disagree however those alliances have to have a strategy to deal with the two super powers coming for good fights which us lessor mortals know as being a total curb stomp so do you set up to play smart or do you set yourself up to be a harvest of tears being limited to only the systems you can defend makes the curb stomp so much more likely and i really wonder just how that will pan out with destructible stations you know the answer because that is why you guys joined the imperium before aegis sov that is true but you understood that blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
well actually we keep our stuff in npc 00 and pretty much always have done
if you want it more than them youll deserve it and youll get itif they care enough about a system to put a couple of rlml caracals and a damp keres into it then you wont
this is beneath you show us where you stand on the merits of fozzie sov that have not already been shot down in other words can you grief a system until they give up defending it or can you ecm until they give up griefingi think at this point you are harping on about the story you bought when fozzies team conceived this abortion and now you cant let it gohtfu we are hard and bored  not interesteddominion sov took how long for half the player base to be bored of it how many years fozzie sov has hit that point in three weeksit is sov dumbed down and less engaging
now thats embarasing it did not have approval of the alliance i guess scratch that name from the list then
you should hang out with ru community sometimes if someone thought that textbook goon had a low opinion on average pubbie hed have a lot to reevaluate after the experienceand you guys are suggesting them to not just tolerate but recruit such people jokes on you
eve community is a strangesaying a peaceful mining barge of a new player must be immune to the attack of a t1 destroyer is hilarious tears and the reply is htfu  l2psaying the trillion isk printing machine of the 1000 strong empires ran by the oldest players must be immune to the attack of an entosis ship is a serious suggestion and get 1s
and you just showed what a silly bean you are the thing about mining barges and exhumers is that their tank should be able to tak a single t1 destroyer until concord arrive in a 05 system personally i would make it about 4 t1 destroyers in a 05 system there you go requires a team approach which is what eve is all about those people can now go htfu and play as a team wait that only applies to mission runners and the like as they keep sprouting on and on in the forums facepalm and all thati agree with you on the second part of your post these people deserve to lose their space i was shocked at tri signing on to that but found it to be an out of touch ceo what ho and all that i am in stain at the moment and i see loads of these people running level 4 missions including the mission alt of the leader of the sovietunion alliance their crying is so funny when their leaders cant even do the grind blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

highsec miners are telling you to htfu  and to adapt or die
check my post history i create threads to try give miners more stand and fight rather than dock or die support further walking in stations development would like to see t1 industrials become less paper thin am a logi anchor and occasional fleet commander for a null sec alliance lead a group that raids worm holes mostly for loot but we fit to pvp if we run into someoneand i say that this fozzie sov is a step backwards because it is making the sov mechanics childish and slowyou can no longer make a composition and fits for damage to grind fasteryou can no longer improve your repair ships to fix the structures fasternow all you do is wave a wand from pretty much any shiputter garbage     what ever the heck label suits you today
fuzzisov just got rolled in and tears are filling the bucketsmany bigmassive alliances whining about new sov mechanics they whining that they cant defend themselves from small groups of people and their unused space gets attacked they crying like babies instead of embracing the new system fuzz has just started and amount of fun and game content we have has simply skyrocketed 1000 for us all these crybaby egoistic multiregion sov holders see is way to manage other peeps to force them to pay rent to make isk isk isk they are the reason ccp changed this game so drastically fuzz sov means who ever has sov needs to live in it and protect it as opposed to safely hold sov and whoever challenges it to blob any challenger with blob of peeps and capssupersstop crying and get on board ccp you doing a great job nerf the moon milk cows next and fix poses long live fuzz sovbest thing that happened to eve in 10 years
awesome changes ccp doing it right its game mechanics now stop crying and conform sov holders will not be able to hold empty systems that cannot be defended from now all your tears are about losing surplus profit a lot of capsuleers now have more fun then ever and guys your whining is miserable
are you going to go back to crying when we get the adm up to max in pure blind so that you have to actually take almost an hour rather than the 10 to 20 minute trolling that your doing presentlyits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka
thats ok i did one that was 40  minutes long the othere day and reinforced it if you think thats going to stop us from entosing it well you are so wrong
i personally think thar fuzzisov was a good idea for ccp to implement it was a way for them to break up the complete strangleholds that the larger alliances such as goonswarm have held on the their regions such as pureblind delkin etc but the way that ccp introduced the system was a little sloppy in the sense that it does allow things like the troll ceptor and the trolltron to be used by a single person to completely mess up an entire system while i currently have no thoughts on how exactly this system can be fixed i do feel that possibly increasing the time of the entosis link cycle or maybe reducing the vulnerability time windows forcing people that may want to take the system to actually form a somewhat sizeable fleet may help reduce the tension and frustration that this new system has caused untill a somewhat agreeable fix has been decided upon remember guys the reason that ccp did this was to in a sense throw a monkey wrench of sorts in to the stagnated area of null sec so let try and respect their decision and not bash them for it but help them find the solution to make fuzzisov work
you want what was instead of what is the new reality of nullsec if your species cannot adapt then like nonadaptive species before youyou will become extinct as you should and some new more adaptable species will take your spaceworking as intendedyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
nullsec had years to fight and chose nonagression pacts instead making a change to nullsec mechanics a must one of the nullsecs mantras thrown at highsec for years you have a choice and in this case you have a choice fight for your sov or lose itgod i love using your own tired old mantras back at nullsecyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
no actually the space could just be left empty thats what youd expect from trollsov after all
people make more iskhr running npc l4s according to some accountsim worse on twitter but to cover a few thingsim pointing at interceptors im of the persuasion that holding sov encourages group conflict as a conflict driverim of the understanding that isk generation is not the be all and end all of nullsecim of the opinion that larger sov can be retained by having a blops  recon rapier surprisingly in each edge system with a fleet in the most populated system able to accept local bridgingim also looking at this from a development perspectiveif i want an even chance for alliance members to utilise developed systems ill develop more systems than just leaving 100 alliance members to fight for the one developed systems catchesim also looking at specific mineral requisition i dont like the idea of leaving a system near my space untouched while i cope with ore distribution in my developed industry system and then long hauling any expedited mineral demands from those undeveloped systems nearby unrefined it doesnt leave any wiggle room for nerfs  strength increases as fozzie further balances ships exposure is not a position players are forced into with the right planningthis small is power approach being put forward for defense would mean the same as a hisec to null invasion eventually you run out of things you need to meet your own objectives this for me was the reason larger fleets increased their efficiency using 1time cost drones instead of running account ammo
after 3 evenings of pvping in fuzzysov i already realize that it is a huge content generator and for that i love it thank you for the best patch ive seen in eve cpp i do strongly disagree with the blobbers complaint about harassment by smaller entities due to the asymmetric mechanics the attackersharassers have to put in a multitude of the manhours for entosising that the defenders have to commit if the defender is twice the size of the attackers and needs only half the manpower when playing it right and still cant hold his space then he doesnt  deserve it period get out of 00 blobber garbage now of course the carebears are crying now who have been hiding behind millions of structure hitpoints for years reducing the game to a  boring blob fest with no skill required but social networking of course they got bad at pvp over the years that way its only natural if you dont keep excercisingsov space was always meant as something you had to earn by fighting for it and not as your birthright by inheritance i see big alliances complaining here who outnumber us anywhere between 21 to 101 in daily engagements if they are not willing to split into smaller groups to contest the different aggressors because of being scared to bear the responsibility of loosing a fight against an entity that specializes into skirmishes it is their own fault if they loose contests for timersif anything it is still way to easy for large alliances to defend sov after aegis the only way they can ever loose space is by not showing up for fights all a numerically superior force would have to do is split up on the different command nodes i hope that this tear fest will not sway ccp to make any changes after all this new sov system was proposed supported and signed off by the leaders of the big alliances beforehandand now they are crying 
and when we discovered that we would actually have to use our sov and dear god defend it against all agressors both large and small you used all that baited breath to wail like infants that defending your sov is something ccp should be doing for youwell doneyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
reading your words seems to me that you like to see an empty null sec space instead of a full one with many targetsare you monitorizing the game are you aware that peolple are leaving null sec space do you think they will come back to take sovno mate they dont want the sov they just want to live in null and they are half of the players did you know that small corps cant just hold sov they dont want to fight all day long they dont care about ctaUFFFDs some of them are f tired about that they only want to play a few hours if they cant do that in null well they will do it in hs or low sec sometimes they go into a wh just for the fun and its done can you just imagine who will going to lose in the end of course null sec will lose in the end and pvpeers in null will get bored this is what you are asking for when you have no targets and nothing to do what are you going to do mine wait you are not going to mine ccp are going to give one bot for that so you have to rat rat rat and rat again of course you can always come to hs kill miners if there are any at that time or kill some mission runners until the day you will have nothing to kill then you will say to yourself that you have been wrong all the time and its time for you to leave the gameeven with dominion sov people are not going to null just because they cant move their assets due the capital nerf people want their assets there not buying new ones they have their assetsyou realized how many people have left the game since ccp have nerfed capitals and whUFFFDs industry and mining2 years ago on europe primetime we had about 54000 players now we have at the most 32000 this sounds good to you ccp are collecting what he have seeded
to hold that up as some kind of threat means youre being mislead by the purpose of moa or any other small alliance its never been about the value of that moon pos or station to us its been about the fight its been about undocking the ship and finding a way to make you win or lose something if youre in moa or any of other smaller groups its never been about how to get rich or to have a titan if that was the case we would just join you we are here to play the game and if that means spending 2 hours with an entosis link on an interceptor we will do it and your friends whining about how easy it is for us to outrun you when you land on us with a leviathan is fun and worth the effort bring us renters in pure blind our new mission will be to send them running with their tails between their legs we will show up in corms and blast their t2s out of space like we always havewelcome back to null seckeep them bubbled til they pukegen eve
from what im seeing in this whine thread it seems like war has broken out everywhere you just dont like the style and someone elses fun shouldnt be nerfed just because you dont like ityawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
read until the part where someone from mordus angels accused somebody else of being bad at pvp was laughing to hard for further reading
oh boy i cant wait until ccp swaps the old pos  outpost structures for the new ones where youll be able to entosis your way right through someones afk moon mining enterprise thats going to be some good show

yeah it ia a lot more fun holding sov you dont use dont have to defend because of nonagression pacts and calling for highsec nerfs 237 because you had nothing better to do with your time im sure you loved ityawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really

for all you whiners that dont like fozzie sovhtfu ccpi think fozzie sov is one of the best things that has happend to this game adapt or die
qft
you use the loaded word abusing when what is actually occurring is you are using fair game mechanics to make life uncomfortable for another sov as you shouldyou are not committed to taking their space and i believe you but your implication that all people using this system think as you do is fallacious since you do not know their designsthe current consensus you are speaking of is coming from the very groups this system was intended to upset and the system is doing just that thanks for pointing that outyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
you find it sour or bitter i find it sweetits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka
fozziesov is the best thing happened in eve for a long time finally sov alliances get to really defend their space and mostly the space they dont use
so you are having to fight sounds good keep up the good workyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
what is keeping you from using fozziesov as a tool to engage sov holders in battle nothingi think we have found the problemyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
who said you have to idly sit back and do nothing with the new game mechanics who insists you cannot attack your neighbor you should have had to always defend what you have and steal your neighbors spaceyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
if you have not been there for a few weeks then it is time to get a group in there that will use it daily working as intendedyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
since nullsec has used griefing as you call it in things like burn jita that you now claim griefing is bad gaming would be hilarious if it werent so patheticyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
you forgot to address the point that youre largescale rentershere i gave you anoher chance to do so
yeah troll ceptors avoiding trollceptors while trollceptors avoid trollceptors and oops its over already lets wait for the next vulnerability windowits not fun not for the attacker and not for the defenderi remember someone saying that trollceptors were not going to be a thing and here we are trollceptoring the  and will to log in out of each other d
welli want the command node number decreased andor you want an automatic win on uncontested timers
if you ever participated in fozziesov ops youd know that cepters used only for scouting
give yourself chance to read whole post
then dont live in space you actually have to defend if you dont want todefend itthere are places called low sec and high sec where you dont need to commit resources to defend space moving to null should be a conscious choice to put in effort to defend spacehow hard is it to orbit a node with an alt and send out the call if someone shows up or better use it as a recruiting effort using rookies as scoutsdefendersdont whine when mechanics change get creative and adapt to it thats what eve is about at the heart of it just because this is disrupting the massively safe blue doughnut doesnt mean you shouldnt adapt
i have and they werent 
omg fozziesov is realy working bring some mops for all these tears
to be honest im kind of against this it seems like it would get abused by certain pilots those with too much cash or too much isk to just remap whenever they wanted to for example going from navigation to combat to industry etc they would just remap instead of buying implants or really planning things out long termthe only way id be okay with this being implemented would be a cool down on purchased remaps maybe 6 months that way it couldnt be spammed just to maximize sp gain every single time you felt like training something differentedit forgot to mention that this is actually a good suggestion i could see it being implemented i just hope its implemented in a way that its not easy to abuse

youve played this game since 2008 and yet you dont understand the fundamentals of the game610 troll better next time
if a tower has been offline for 30 days give us the option to hack it and salvage it so we would need both hacking and archeology that would free up the pos for us to take as well as any modules etc data  hacking to get into the computer system to release the anchors or make them vulnerable and use salvaging to undo them let me clean up space while making a profitadds more sue to the skills as well as a side note i think hacking should be able to get into giant secured containers anchored in space as well if you can hack it 
shoot it
not empty quoting
did you really just suggest we stick new players in ships orbiting laser nodeswhat the hell is wrong with youdo you actually want to keep new players in this game
a lot of new players do this kind of thing on their own and a frightening number of them stick with it and end up bitter and annoyed with making iskies 
the problem is the numbers dont match your claims goons rank 35th out of all sov holding alliances in terms of pilotssystem the top 10 are decent sized alliances many of us know who hold just a few systems 14 in ns like pandemic legion nulli secunda and ncif you were to you know actually look at the data youd see that those alliances that have a high number of pilotssystem seem to be weathering the initial phases of fozziesov reasonably well those who do not post threadnaughts on the forumsedit also the cfcimperium was one of the few coalitions to actually try and adapt fozziesov prior to fozziesov hitting the game they dropped quite a bit of sov and reshuffled things around the signatories of this petition on the other hand sat on their hands and did nothing
adapt or dieguess we know what will happen to the russians then
so you are claiming that the people attacking arent having fun come on they wouldnt do it if they didntthe person not having fun is the person being agressed but that is the case in about 99 of all combat in eve so suck it up and either do or dont your choice word emphasized because that is what eve is aboutyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
theyll be fine because the hordes from highsec only care to gun for us
i read this as i want ccp to nerf legitimate fighting tactics because im grossly incompetent and cant kill anything moving faster than 1500msdid i get that rightyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
hi im eve i guess we never met before well things are going to be tough for you if you keep clinging to your current belief about how i intend to treat you punches you in the crotchis it clearer nowyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
ccp has gone and pissed off the russians theyll have only themselves to blame when they start receiving packages laced with rare radioactive isotopes
pretty much although it does seem to me a few bits could use some polish some parts that shouldnt be annoying are way too annoying and other aspects are no where near annoying enough troll ceptors are boring troll devs are better
so whatno more free wodka at ccp office 
can we hold the tears until phase three launches guysfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
release the space you dont live in pure blinddont and suffer the consequences coming to protect themand stop whining for trying to protect space you dont live inits your fault
thats because you tend to just blob anything that comes to fight to hell and back calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
so yesterday someone tried to entosis a pl tcu in a 1x systemi was able to burn to the system in a inti get on grid to see itUFFFDs a 4ks vaga 200km off i burn at him and he burns awayUFFFD he then left and never came back someone unentisised the tcu and we went homeop success thatUFFFDs how you defend in fozzie sov boys and girls
now if you could just repeat this 501000 times and write the next post accurately describing the amount of fun you had doing this from op 35 onwards i think wed all be a bit more enlightened on why a system that seems to promote sovlasering structures without any conflict being necessary or fights occurring possibly being a bit flawedbonus points for alarmclocking for a chase or two since most reinforces will usually be done at the worst possible timezone for you the second you let your indexes slip
or we could just let the guy entosis it and then never bother going to the system because the lone guy will never come back to do 23h of work on something in a system no one cares about all while us not loosing the benefit of the sov in the 1st placeyep yep i think we will do thati was just pointing out its super easy to get to a system and stop some one entosising and if some one was actively ratting or mining in there it would be even easier we also dont need to alarmclock for anything because we have a a fully active autz who are more than willing to log in and feed to people
this guys speaks the truth theres a massive difference between scaring away one random etosis troll and trying to fend of a persistent group of them that keep on coming back at the worst timeswe both know this because hes the troll and i am on the receiving end its not fun its extremely frustrating and again we get almost no fights he has gotten a few good kills but considering everything i wouldnt say its worth doing for the occasional kill and getting kills because your enemies are falling asleep and be driven mad by all the rng timers and massively time consuming nodes is not good for the game in the long term
as corporation recruiter for mortum ravagers i have to saylol nerds come to lowsec and fight like real men
your killboard says you have been fighting in null calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
yeah we roam there occasionally tbh merlin roams ftw
how unfortunate
they need to  can fozzie what fun is a game that you dont have to earn your accomplishments so now for all of us that put the time and work into grinding standings sov and training cap lvl ships turns out to be just a waste of time sadly world of ships is more like eve was in the good old days before fozzie screwed it up
youve only yourself to blame for not using capital ships youve trained for nobody forces you to stay docked
welli want the command node number decreased andor want an automatic win on uncontested timers
1 ccp obviously doesnt care or they wouldnt have done it2 i have no doubt they will not fix this3 ive been watching all my favorite ships get nerfed into junk for 2 years now complain and people call you names and tell you to adapti still like evebut am well past the point of caring now if it simply dies off ive gone from 9 accounts down to 2 all were paid for with cash i laugh at the emails i get asking me to come back with these old accounts 2 accounts are ok for me for now maybe some day things will go back the other way i really hope so
yes yes i did i did nothing but scout trading routes for a null alliance after two weeks from starting the excitement of being part of something that massive was the only thing that kept me in the gamewhat would you rather them do get 50 mil in thank you isk for doing that a stupidly big amount for a week old player while chatting with experienced vets learning about the game or afk mine in a venture while watching netflix and end up quittinghave you played eve beforealso whats keeping you from having an alt orbit that node while alttabbed i have two alts doing similar things 100 of the time im playing
more alliance leaders signed off on that petition those who sign it and i expect more will sign it thank you for your support
if people really care about what they are saying is to easy to show them that they are wrong and the players dosent want1  this new sov2  capital nerfs3  ship rebalance all the time4  skins and clothesfor that you can just simply make 2 things1  retreat to low sec and disconnect all the toons and dont pay the subscription or dont buy the plex2  create new toons for free until they give players what players wantits very simple indeed with new toons you can always make some rookie pvp in low and get some fundont bother with the systems that you are lefting behind you can always back there whoever take sov there cant hold the sov for too long or if they are atackedi assume i will do it with you despite iUFFFDm in hs and low if you all choose to do it
yes the real protest here would be throwing ones sov in the dumpster and doing something else until such time as ccp took notice but you will observe that none of the whinging chaps here are interested in that theyve invested much time and effort into sov ala dominion so i cant say that i blame them however nobody is going to take notice of the forum petition when nullsec looks almost identical to the empires that existed prior to its rolloutalso i dont like it because its not fun is a really ironic argument coming from coalitions of english and russian speakers who literally carved their empires out by making the game as unfun as possible for their enemies thats always been a key factor in sov warfare and always will be the only major difference now is who has the upper handi dont know whats more amusing here the fact that the games largest coalitions feel the need to bleet about how unfun it is to retain control over vast swathes of space or the fact that not terribly many years ago those in control of said coalitions would have been thrilled at this chance to troll the  out of their larger enemies
i dont generally fly in nullsec but it does still seem like the nullsec community are still bored less and are using a campaign of harassment note this is the ops description of the activity on the high sec freight routes when this will end i have no idea it doesnt personally affect me either but it does like fozziesov apparently  off a lot of people as well pot calling the kettle black is the shortened version of the above commentthere seems to be a fascination with increased ship speed as well for quite a while some of the incursion communities have embraced this fully forsaking tank for vastly increased warp speed the mind boggles  i get the lore implication in that we are heading to an end game where probably alliances in nullsec will be able to build there own jump gates to explore new regions of space but it does seem like the speed thing has gone a little to far nowi remember a long time ago there were ideas thrown about to encourage more pilots to populate nullsec via systems with special environmental effects to give them a boost or some kind of protection from just having their skulls smashed against a brick wall im not sure if the new system will enable this to happen or not

totally not empty quotingnosir
there is a difference between when players make decisions tactical and strategic to try an bore their enemy to death vs ccp making the gaming deathly boring
i agree with the broad sentiments outlined by uaxdeath here
watching a sov structure melt under the combined firepower of a wellendowed super fleet is objectively less involved by number of players sat at the keyboard doing something than chasing troll ceptors its the slug matches that occur in between that we log in for theres really no way to make provoking a sov battle fun  because its always going to be about setting up a timer and waiting for the actual fun bit laterthis whole argument around how fun entosis jazz isnt does not hold water the lack of fun comes from the unwillingness of players to fight and that doesnt come from their space being alight 237 it comes from the entrenched entitlement of bloc leadership who dont want people having fun they just want to retain or expand their space holdings
i dont see the problem with what you call a troll ceptori mean you cant fit a tech ii entosis on a ceptor so this is out of the questionyou can however fit a tech i into a ceptor but ceptor can only entosis within 25kmso its really easy to deal what you call a troll ceptor1 you can damp them and they will have to start the process again from scratch very easy2 ecm them and they will have to start the process again from scratch very easy3 kill it get a fast ship and scram the end easy4 you can scram it with an arazu the end very easy5 also it cannot warp so all it can do is try and out run you get a fast ship and hunt it down easythis does not have to be as hard as quantum mechanics dont over think itor are you asking for it to be sitting still so that you can always kill it just like you would with a cheap cyno if so you are not suppose to be able to kill everything you happen to see the target is suppose to have a chance of getting out
so you are not utilizing the system and in fozziesov when you dont use a system it becomes difficult to holdthank you for the eloquent definition of working as intendedyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
i think we need to see further balance changesentities like moa still cant take sov and that makes me sad
are we sure that moa wants to take  and hold on to  sov or are the mostly interested in punishing alliances still trying to use dominion sov tactics
but an even bigger thank you goes out to those members of large corps and alliances from nullsec that came here and decried this hypcritical piece of trash for what it really isthey rest of eve appreciates that you stand by your core values even when game changes go against what is probably your best interestsyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
i see a lot complaining that entosis is not fun and you dont get the big fightscurrently we are the only game in town in the north besides oss in venalblack legion is in fountain at the momment doing their thing we will not fight battles vs 200 sub cap  cap fleets  super  titans you must have figger that out by nowso if cfc really wants to get all their big slug fest with supers and titans all that then why dont you go and attack black legion in fountain what are you waiting for you can grind all structures that you want and poss maybe even reset some of your alliesblues to neutralor even better why dont you deploy and attack fountain deploy to fountain put a few poses log supers and titans and get your butts there hell camp their station like you guys do to us why is this not happeningthe cfc has over 50000 people in their coalition surelly you can do that can you
its delicious to read that people who cant handle a few frigs wanna a rollback to get more fight and in the mean time we all know that the previous system equal 1 or 2 tidi fights per year some people have a seriously broken logic
in all fairness when i lived in sov null it was tidi nearly every night calm down miner as you pointed out people think they can get away with stuff they would not in rl like for example illegal mining  ima wreckyou
yeah man tidi is terrible and you are lucky if you are the first to load grid if not then you are going to lose probably badly half your fleet will be dead before you know what happened
1lets take time to remember this gem as well
frustrating people you dont want in an area is a speciality of a certain group of players that have been doing it for more than a decade and laughing at the people they frustrate since im not one for naming names illl just call them by a code word sovholderssince this same group will repeat this nuisance behavior repeatedly even when they know no large scale battle will ever come from frustrating a lone explorer in a frigate i will use your term and call them trolls and while im at it since that explorer will meet this same problem from this same group no matter how many times he returns to exploring in his frigate i will also call for ccp to make game mechanic changes so that that explorer can explore nulllsec without further trolling from sovholdersi know that given how clearly your collective has stated that fighting frigates is something sov holders should not be doing in nullsec i fully expect to see your entire collective sign my petition to end this type of fightingthank you in advance for your support yawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
i imagine that the problem has less to do with it requiring occupancy and more to do with it requiring massive amounts of structure lasering to fend off people who have no interest in taking the space anyway but can contest it with relative ease fozziesov is boring as sin thats the problem with it
assuming occupancy is there i dont see how massive amounts of structure lasering would ever happen within the 15 to 60 minutes required for a t1 entosis to capture anything undock a vni or caracal maybe warp to the tcu or ihub chase away or kill the interceptor and youre doneif your system is empty and you cannot get anybody to it in time to prevent the capture that results in reinforcement followed by command node spawning then youre missing the occupancy partthe system doesnt require occupancy but it punishes lack of occupancy be inflicting whackamole its up to your alliances judgment to determine how they want to handle it
there is nothing in the old sov or the new that keeps you from busting out your big ships and blasting your neighbor in fact only one word has ever stood between quite boring nullsec and total space carnage and that word is choice since game mechanics new or old cannot force you occupants of nullsec to fight and becauae you chose and still apparently still choose to not fight the only problem standing between you and large scale engagements is your own decision not toyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
its all that chasing though isnt it all sorts of points to be captured all over and youre chasing around disposable ships that the enemy dont care about and all it takes is one of those many points to slip though while youre chasing frigates about for command nodes to be spawningthe whole idea of sov is it was supposed to promote actual conflict it has failed to do that
on the 7 accounts you closedcan i haz your stuffs i like to use phrases nullsec is familiar with so im sure we are clearly communicatingyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
so in a post that goes into detail how you are fighting throughout your sov to maintain your sov holdings you conclude that no conflict is occurringto you i introduce the term non sequitor or as it is sometimes referred to as it does not follow meaning your statements of fact dont support your conclusion and in fact in this case your facts actually refute your own conclusion which is even worseyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
wow dont people get it yet  youre not supposed to be able to keep half off null sec with small  renter alliances the whole point of the sov update was to stop alliances from claiming much more space than a they need and b they are able to protectthis is just another cry for nullbear easymode status
it currently promote conflict just not conflict with explosions we are continuously fighting over those systems to takehold them peoples chase for the most efficient way of doing it is what cause trollceptor to be what we see so often fight denial was used in eve since forever being irritated that it get used in a new way under a new system is just plain stupid
oh my i just realized i was gravely mistaken about something  i had been thinking that it was moa who reinforced a big chunk of bls fountain but now i know that it was actually your own alliance sma were you part of that op what did you think of it ive read you guys lost 40 interceptors in the effort did you kill anything what do you plan on doing with the nodes once they spawnthe last game of sov updates  rabbits in the headlights   bonus update
why would moa be entosising bl anywayeveryone knows massadeath only gets it on for the imperium
so it seems some organizations are having issues realizing what occupancy based sov really meanshint if you are finding it too hard to defend your currently claimed systems you should consider recalculating what systems you want to holdhaving a beautiful sov map isnt everything yes the sov map has influenced what some want to claim
i think what you and i define as fighting are disturbingly different chasing disposable ships around is not a fightsince youre determined to avoid the point or too simple to see it ill put it in the most basic language i cani want to see ships of at least moderate value on both sides going boom i want to see people trying to take sov not just slapping a timer then running away to waste the defenders time the system as it stands does nothing to promote these things
how is it were not losing space its easymode as it is its just boring as sin nearly nobody wants to take the space and nobody that does wants to commit the resources to taking the space because you can just throw a handful of disposable ships around and watch the defenders running around defending thats all that gets done once the novelty wears off even that will become boring and there will be even less conflict in null excuse me for thinking the idea of this change was to make people actually fight each other i guess it was really because people love chasing cheap ships designed not to be caught thats why the acu is soaring rightit used to be mixed in with actually fights of course people will run from fights they wont win but fights use to occur now an all out battle is like ooh 2b killed the vast majority of people contesting the sov dont even have interest in actually taking it sorry mate but going from 4k player battles to this crazy whack a mole with disposable ships is not an improvementwatching all these grr goons types crawling out of the woodwork fapping and saying yeah ccp make null more boring is quite hilarious though so i guess theres that
op makes sense for ccp to not have thought and done something about those problems shows that ccp disregards its sovbase playersfozzie sov the way it is now basically says go troll sov space in no regards does it invite small or large scale wars for sov space but hit  run tactics which is flooding the game ever since interceptors became the most op ships in the gameits a big  you to sov owners
there is no mandatory chasing involved structures dont moveif there are command nodes then you already screwedup by not preventing reinforcemententosis links are far better for getting fights than sbus
why would you do that if you want fightson the other hand if you do not want to fight what difference do the sov mechanics makemake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
everybody wants that but new groups were not able to move into dominion sov and take anything due to the mechanics that allowed for passive in absentia defense via huge hp numbers what the aegis sov system is designed to do is give more groups room to expand into null and take that sov it does this by deliberately making it a complete pain in the ass for anybody to defend a system displaced from where they spend their time in the hopes that they stop trying to defend it making it available for somebody else to live in it wasting your time defending a system you dont have anybody in is a deliberate aspect of making you consolidate into space you actually use making your unused space available to be taken by somebody elsewe are less than three weeks into aegis some people are just having fun with it by trolling others are having trouble adjusting it will take some time for the borders and tactics of alliances to adjust to what their pain threshold can withstand for defending yes it is possible for an alliance to play whackamole and rush around chasing interceptors and keep a tentative grasp on their dominion sov that is hindering the movement of new groups into sov null it will take time for groups historically shut out of sov to make their way in hopefully some are looking at the map and planning just that and will be able to once some of the established alliances realize they need to let go of some of their systems due to the pain of holding them
except there is since little entosis ships pop up all over the place and are designed to be as evasive as possible because they are designed to not fight im all for the system for people to more easily contest sov but they have to actually commit to it to doing so the idea this was pitched as was help smaller groups get into sov not make sov holders chase frigatesand so far thats proving to be wrong entosis links are getting tiny little skirmishes from time to time while sbus used to get big fights quite frequentlythats my point they dont want fights they want to contest sov and run away knowing that the defenders have to run around unlasering everything its the space equivalent of going to somebodies early organise game shelf and swapping all the dics over and scattering them around the room then running away with your pants on your head youve achieved nothing except the knowledge that the owner of the game collection has to put them all back as a gameplay mechanic it sucks
but thats not whats happening is it people are just running around firing entosis lasers at absolutely everything they can whether defenders are using the space or not an the defenders have to run around wasting their time undoing that the people contesting sov have absolutely no intention of taking iti have to ask have you actually played with the new mechanic because it sounds like you havent really used it its boring insanely boring its much simpler to just go blow up noobs in niarja since at least there you get to see something explode to be honest the idea was flawed from the getgo they effectively took structure bashing which nobody liked then thought wouldnt this be better if it was like mining turns out its not better surprise surprise considering the csm have sat up pretty sharply im hoping ccp have realised that from the incredibly lack of player surge following the release
ah yes this unlasering part seems a bit strange to me are the defenders forced to do it or would the structures deentosis themselves anyway after a certain period of timeif the attackers were chased off and dont come back in a reasonable period of time 1 hour seems to me that the attack was clearly unsuccesful and the mopup is just a boring chore indeedmake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
the stated goals areccp fozzie wrotegoal 1 as much as possible ensure that the process of fighting over a star system is enjoyable and fascinating for all the players involvedgoal 2 clarify the process of taking holding and fighting over star systemsgoal 3 minimize the systemic pressure to bring more people or larger ships than would be required to simply defeat your enemies on the field of battlegoal 4 drastically reduce the time and effort required to conquer undefended spacegoal 5 provide significant strategic benefits from living in your spacegoal 6 spread the largest sovereignty battles over multiple star systems to take advantage of new edenUFFFDs varied geography and to better manage server loadgoal 7 any new sovereignty system should be adaptable enough to be rapidly updated and to incorporate future changes to eveyou could argue goal 1 but it seems to me at least that you have chosen to be on the defensive rather than the offensive and possibly not properly defend
aegis sov isnt meant to allow smaller groups get into sov by fighting the big groups for systems  aegis sov is meant to allow smaller groups to get into sov by causing larger groups to stop trying to defend those systems in the first place then once done different groups move into sov null attracted hopefully by the anom changes and there will be more interalliance conflict were at the very beginning of the first phase of sov null movement this is not endgame sov state if you have to run around your sov to protect it youre doing it wrong the game owner should be holding their discs in their hands at all times not allowing the pantsonhead kid anywhere near them if your reach is too short to hold on to your discs you need to evaluate which discs are truly important
goal 1 as much as possible ensure that the process of fighting over a star system is enjoyable and fascinating for all the players involvednope not seeing any of thisgoal 2 clarify the process of taking holding and fighting over star systemsi guess yes its simple enough to understand so yeah well donegoal 3 minimize the systemic pressure to bring more people or larger ships than would be required to simply defeat your enemies on the field of battlenumber  organisation will always win and its probably a good thinggoal 4 drastically reduce the time and effort required to conquer undefended spacei dont know it take more or less the same amount of time requires a lot fewer people to initiate and is still just as boring as shooting 40m hp structuresgoal 5 provide significant strategic benefits from living in your spacelonger timers are a significant strategic benefit i assumegoal 6 spread the largest sovereignty battles over multiple star systems to take advantage of new edenUFFFDs varied geography and to better manage server loadits not working but that isnt the fault of the system players and organisations are just painfully slow at figuring that out effective ways to effectively sovlaser while everyone else is dicking around in trollceptorsgoal 7 any new sovereignty system should be adaptable enough to be rapidly updated and to incorporate future changes to evewhatever
1 its not enjoyable2 the system is more obscure than the last one and most info isnt readily available in game3 by more people they mean more than one and by larger ships they mean anything bigger than a frigate might have gone too far there if people do choose to bring more ships youre still sol if you dont bring more4 that was successful5 thats yet to be seen since the timer is still short enough that you have to drop everything you are doing to rush over and shoot troll ships whenever they turn up i guess the main issue here is that nothing makes the attackers have to actually commit more to attacking6 again this one is sort of done but its only because there are no large sov battles why thats considered a good thing i have no idea maybe international press wasnt something ccp enjoyed7 any system can be tweaked over time even the old sov system
the small groups dont want the sov theyve made that painfully clear by not bothering to show up for timers and even if by some miracle a big group gets bored of defending and gives up the system the new guys still cant move in because the big group will just show up and repeatedly gank them until they stop trying to live thereyeah must be doing it wrong i forgot that to hold sov were supposed to stand guard on the tcu and ihub and station constantly in every single system we own so that if someone shows up we dont have to switch ships and fly around after themi have a feeling you dont know what games are for they are not career choices the idea that an attacker should be able to just show up in a cheap disposable ship and start lasering while a defender needs to constantly stand guard is moronic i dont care if it ends up that we can only hold half the space we do but defending shouldnt be more of a chore than attacking shouldnt require more committed resources than attacking and both sides of the mechanic should be entertaining and promote meaningful conflict
while a lot of people will say that there is already a solution for what you see as a problem the other side of the coin is that ccp do like conflict drivershowever this whole thing has been discussed at length before and there is a problem with the hacking ideaif you could hack an offline tower the game mechanics would have to decide what to do with a tower after a successful hack the obvious choice is to unanchor it so it could be scooped then you would probably see lots of afk inties orbiting towers tower market gets saturated people end up just reprocessing towers and that would have an effect on minerals as well as towersassuming that ccp decided this was a problem or a potential conflict driver i would prefer one of the other proposed solutions which is to degrade the shields over a period of time say 1 per day for example which would drop the shields to zero after 100 days and make pos bashing a bit less time consuming or more open to the general public
lots of tears means all is well in eve universe
1  not really nobody are fighting for star systems theyUFFFDre just trolling star systems nobody cares about null sec anymore unless for trolling so this point is a big fail2  as stated and ccp can see that theres no new alliances contesting systems just some alliances that are already in null sec are spreading a create new alliances so nothing changes hs people are not going there once again so we have another big fail3  well this one is a go not much people fighting neither big ships thats the way to an very nice empty null space4  conquer what i dont see any conquered space just new alliances coming from old ones they stay where they are5  strategic benefits what strategic benefits being disrupted is a benefit maybe they are talking about from ihub and upgrades sales that is benefit for those who are manufacturing it in hs6  sov battles i havent see any since this new sov mechanics just troll nothin more but trolling7  well maybe the future changes are bots and more bots providing by ccp due the lack of null sec players and players in game they are decreasing intead of increasingplayers who have left are not turning back until they have what they want and part of them are not going back anymore they are felling defrauded by ccp so i cant blame them since the last 4 years we get all in one way or another being defrauded due the systemic nerfs changes on the way we play the game and ccp words are adpat so for at least 20000 palyers they have adapted themselves once and for all they leave the game and i belive much more will leave the game soon enough new players dont count on that when they reach the game they leave in a week or two too complex too many changes all the time scaming and harassment to new players who dosent know what to do so their best way is to move to another game without all of this
can i have your stuff
let me assure you the simpleton is on your side the this issue when someone makes a poor decision and pays a price and whines to ccp that some change needs to be made you nullsec types tell them that decisions in eve have consequences and that they should stop whining to ccp for changes when they only have themselves to blamelet me state that i agree with this statement it is absolutely the right one to hold for this gamenow we come to the part where apparently you are a bit thickheadedyou nullsec chose nonaggression pacts you chose not to fight your neighbors you knew that your choice was counter to the very fundamentals upon which this game standsyou made bad choices now deal with the unpleasant consequences and stop whining to ccp yawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
keep in mind that currently they cant have sov regardless of how painful to the established alliances the tactics are they nevertheless are effective tactics small groups get denied sov get kicked out of sov because of groups operating under the dominion paradigm of keeping everything they can capture indeed larger groups can harass and evict smaller groups just like groups can get evicted out of wormholes just like groon or bos or noc could hellcamp cas and if not in reality at least in effect erase us from syndicate and yet meaningful and exciting and significant conflict happen in wormholes and npc null well yes thats exactly it youre starting to see thats the very definition of occupancy sov i think you still have the cause and effect backwards however you dont live in a system because you want to defend it  you defend a system because you want to live in it defending a system you live in from a trollceptor is not a chore and does not require committing significant resources
destroying the will of an enemy to fight is a core combat technique even in the real world certainly it has applications in a video gameyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
concerning ccp fozzies goals for the new mechanics1 you could consolidate your holdings to places you occupy and use thus reducing your exposure to being entossed you could entoss your neighbor alliances you could show up when said entossed alliance must defend its space giving you the big fight you claim to want this would be using fozziesov rather than whining about it in short you are not having fun because you are chosing not to not because the game mechanics are wrong only your approach to them is wrong and your approach is now outdated27 working as intendedyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
ok lets get this part straight you think that in a game called eve online people are going to somehow eventually get tired of trollingare you new here
where did i say trolling would stop note that i only mentioned changes on the sov holders part i think  no i hope  that the people being trolled will figure out how to deal with it easily but maybe salty posts by sov holders getting trolled will become as common as salty posts by haulers getting ganked shrug
waking up every morning and having to clean up the mess made while you were asleep is boring yay now you have to stand guard to prevent someone making a mess who doesnt even want your sov hey a solution that is even more boring than watching pant dry no fun allowed you got guard duty for x hours exciting gameplay there i tell you what this is supposed to be a god damned game not a second job but hey i guess ccp is taking eve is real to a whole new levelits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka
im giving 7to1 odds that lucas wears you all outhe is a tireless poster and is worse than the energizer bunnyyou have been warned i havent checked but i bet he is still posting in the thread about broadcatingmultiplexingeven if nobody else is hah i was right although he is not the only one still posting to that thread
if your alliance is asleep during your vulnerability period whomever chose that period is stupidccp fozzie wrotea system with military and industrial each at 1 would already have shrunk its vulnerability window all the way to 818 hours a system with military 5 and strategic 5 quite common would have a vulnerability window of 4 hoursso for 4 hours a day you are incapable of having at least one person per structure in system to stop capture no need for guardduty just homedefense by whomever is err homeminers ratters or alts it doesnt take much oh and you have 50 minutes to respond at adm 5
to be fair goonswarm is a bigUFFFD alliance so it it is almost surely the case that for many in the alliance that they are asleep when the systems are vulnerable
jenn only reads what she thinks you said then decides to go all superior on it gives me hours of fun when i am afk cloaky camped especially when she throws in just how good at pve she is just you wait you will get that soon if you continue to post she has her pve eye on you you quite rightly pointed out that people would either sort themselves out to deal with it or decide to walk away and the trolls would have to up their gameon another note i am still laughing at the people complaining about trolling interceptors they are so easy to stop its laughable its the arazus and lokis with oversized mwds and 250 km locking range that are the real troll ships at least on sov that has no tender loving care which as far as i am concerned is working as intended blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
im fine with people bringing lokis and arazus because at least its the opportunity to kill something a bit more expensive if done correctly
grr nullsecworking with others is not counter to the very fundamentals upon which this game stands and no matter what gets done thats always going to exist being in a bigger better organised group will always have an advantage the idea of fozziesov was to compact the space us big groups took while encouraging people to take sov what its done instead is just encourage people to troll wit disposable ships to waste defenders timewhats happening to this game has nothing to do with choices weve made its to do with ccp being unable to develop an entertaining system for dealing with system ownership and asshats like you cheering them on making the game as boring as possible out of some hatred for groups who work well together
yes they can theres loads of places going spare at the moment what they cant do is expect to snatch up sov on the border of one of the biggest coalitions and hold it without a fight what they want is some system where a 100 man alliance can hold their space against a 30k member coalition without having to put in substantial effort no matter what reasonable system they put in place thats never going to happen in a sandbox game dont get me wrong though the systems as it stands encourages trolling over real attempts to take sovand yet it doesnt happen in sov null because the system actively discourages meaningful conflict thanks for proving the point that its the mechanics not the playerslol no its not the purpose of occupancy sov is for people to live in their space not stand idly in their space at all times just in case people come to get it games are for entertainment an the current system does nothing to promote that having to constantly reship and run around chasing cheap ships designed to be uncatchable is not entertaining seriously i think you need to actually try the system out so you understand the level of boring involved in actively guarding sovsee you keep underselling it if the problem was defending one system from one trollceptor then yeah thered be no problem the problem with disposable ships is that what you end up defending against is constant trollceptors just look at the timerboards for how many timers are going those are just the ones that slipped through and i guarantee that only a tiny minority are from people actually interested in taking space
destroying the will of people to actually play the game isnt such a good idea in a video game though thats why people like you encouraging ccp to make eve as boring as possible are doing it a disserviceim a goddamn hero is what i am
as a leader of ruca emperor alliance i am agree i sign this petition
the entire alliance is asleep really you are gonna go with that argumentif so again that would also be an example of setting a stupid vulnerability window
if i was in an alliance that was interested in taking space i would attack multiple systems to mask my real target i would also use this to break the will to defend the troll interceptors are easy to kill however i can understand that being a chore if its against people who are just doing it to cause hassle i am looking forward to the first major imperium campaign should be amusing to see just how many people flood into imperium space for pay back timebut i get your point about eve being a game where the main strategy is to bore your enemy out of the game afk cloaky camping is one such strategy used to move towards eves extinction blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
in the real world people also actuallydie destroying your opponents morale is effective but it is not particularly fun for either side eve is supposed to be a game games are supposed to be funbelieve me i lived through years of dominion sov i do not want it back it was not a good system i feel qualified to say that having ground hundreds of structures in stealth bomber fleets in order to deny an enemy a fight that is why dominion sov was terrible replacing dominion sov with an equivalent system is just boneheadedare we noticing a pattern here
perhaps you need to familiarize yourself with the definition of many if i had meant the entire alliance id have written the entire alliance the person you were responding too noted they often have to go and deal with the mess made while he was asleepnot that the entire alliance was asleepreadingits fundamental
isnt there a rule against multi posting i thought there was
why i never would have thought of that possibility at allyou sir are a tactician without peer sun tzu clausewitz and dracvlad
yes this is correct i suppose this is why no timers appear in territories occupied by really big and organized groupsif some groups could not directly contest others for sov during dominion they wont be able now and that wasnt going to change assuming that they want that sov i suppose their goal is not to entertain people currently having their flag there quite the opposite youve said that one of the goals was to compact existing holders and sov trolling is the best average can do to make it happen do it until another guy says no f you and your strategic value im not unwanding this st system we dont have anything in anyway thats how you compact existing groupsor a holder can go painless route pack up and move to nice system you are going to fully upgrade and max indexes there while knowing that maybe another hub zero whatever comes to your former system so you could actually extract some content as opposed to only seeing entosis frigs does it make sense from srs business perspective hell no but here we come to the main partsandbox or ccpdesigned systems being the source of entertainmant pick one what i mean isone and almost the only thing going for eve is that resources for individuals are hard to come by by video game standards and nobody wants to lose them making it feel like conflict matters its core design that you pay for your fun here with hours of soul sucking again by vg standards work you cant have it both fun and meaningful and engaging  anything being fun to acquire means a lot of people will do that making this resource in question worthlessright now though in a sense you must choose to do stupid things here in order for fun to happen npsi fleets are utterly pointless and are waste of resources or they would be if not for the fact that they are supposed to bring action and nothing more same goes for every roam ever its losing ships for no gain  except to have a good timeits time to understand that same will eventually be applied to such assets as extra territories i say extra because people still want their base of operation something to rely on when they want to make some isk in any form and use them to make fun happen again and then there are people like manufacturers miners and other groups that rely on stable places to have their gameplay and fun at alleverything beyond that is a welp for giggles materiali think his point is that if those groups were working well together on generating conflict ccp wouldnt be so pressed to screw around with sov null but that doesnt fall under normal srs business definition of working well together ofcwhat happened to whs is a good illustration when wormholers were killing and evicting each other ccp wasnt doing anything when highclass community entrenched themselves and started to only care about occasional semistaged if semi fights and dunking nullsec ratters out of boredom nerfs and tweaks started to happen such as hole rolling nerf c4 connectivity fix socalled sort dragon nerf
and what was the rest of alliance doing if they have to mop up after them i suppose that sleeping describes that fairly well if not in a literal sense
yeah theres a sort of minimum needed to hold sovbut one person can make a corp make an alliance get some intercceptors or such take your pick and sov lasers and go troll them some sov in them there hills hellsif youre small know where to aim stick to trolling those big enough to hold sov remember unclaimed is your victory cry
well if its one person then its very easy to deal with them after all you got 50000 poeple in your coalitionor are you trying to tell me you cant fend off a small gang or you dont want to if you dont want to then that means you probably dont really want to bother to jump far away where your alliance dont live why defend a system you dont live in i wouldnt too
its not that its hard to deal with them its that its boring as sin this is why people arent rushing back to play with the sov system because its  what should have been a reason for mass resubs has just reaffirmed why a lot of people left in the first place
no its just blindingly obvious its also obvious that the imperium has a counter set up for it too my comment was more aimed in an amused way at the numbers who decide to try it but if you want to make a very lame fuss out of it with a fail sarcastic comment that in effect made you look foolish feel free but you need to improve your reading comprehension skill a bit mate because that sentence was more focussed on the numbers that will come in when you lot are on campaign as compared to the numbers now which some of the lessor imperium members are complaining about blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
ok so if its boring for you defenetly not for me then why defend it why defend a system you are not interested in to alot of other people getting blobbed is not exactly fun i know you guys like it but some others dont and you can not have always your wayor even better why not wait for it to get reinforced and deal with it when it comes out of reinforcement i mean if there is going to be a battle there will be just like in previous sovyou have to concider atm we are the only game in town in the north besides oos so its not like you are going to get a super or capital fight from us  we will deny you the good fight as much as you guys also deny us the good fights
out to ruin your game 
massadeath told us this time would be different and the evil empire would fall
but youre not finding the mechanics fun youre finding it fun because you can use disposable ships to troll huge alliances with ease you cant tell me that you enjoy firing what is effectively a mining laser at a structureand we defend if because we want the space so were forced to take part in terrible mechanics to maintain what we have the idea of this change was to create conflict but its not doing that the thing is you guys have been ctad to this thread by your leadership to support bad mechanics purely because they get kicks out of watching goons have to repeatedly respond to sov trolling we all know the mechanics are bad but your leadership is happy to watch ccp develop bad mechanics because of their grr goons mentality
mechanics itself isnt going to be fun that would imply some sort of pve minigame or something i dunno its all about sorting out who will get to use it at all this is where it should be anywayi mean flag carrying in ut is literally just touching two points on the map consequently but who cares its about shooting players right grr grr goons mentality much
one could say similar things about what happens whenever we go to war
when i am entosing to me its exactly the samethe laser effect may look similar to mining but i dont look at it this way i look at it as if i am shooting lasers at it cos the effect in the end is exactly the same i reinforce it and the structure does blow up in the end exactly as before thats the truththe why we use small ships its easy we cannot afford it and why should we when we get blobbed every time ok so you want to keep space that you dont live in fair enough well suffer the consequences the new expansion is suppose to help smaller entities take space or at least rattle the current space and disrupting a bit the blue balling in evewe are creating conflict otherwise you will not be complaining in hereactually it was me who told our leaders that about the new threads it was me that initiated the post i do what i want to do if i dont like it i leave nobody tell me what to doleaders dont have to tell me anything i like this out of my choice nothign to do with leaders i always wanted to poke at cfc and always wished for a day gorrilla warfare will be a valid game in eve well its finally here and i just cant get enough
guerrilla warfare always has been viable the problem is that gen and massa arent exactly on par with wheniaminspace and ammzi in the tactics department
there is also the problem of currently defending space with relatively low usage case i know there are plans for pb but currently its a shitshow mostly because anyone can freely entosis there i dont recall any systems where people actually live getting trolled yet im not sure about our allies space but id guess they get the same stuff the space they are active in never get reinforced because its easy to prevent and any system where there isnt ever anyone doing anything are the systems trolls keep reinforcing because its easyholding space because you want that space just wont work long term peoples will is bound tu burn down from defending the same system over and over again the space you need on the other hand wont get trolled because nobody will be able to troll entosis a system where you have some ratters in around the clock as long as those ratters put in the effort to prevent reinforcements
well entosis is not the whole package entosis give a real capability for herassment the realisty is that guerilla warfare before was only about spies stealing gate camps and cyno jumping someone paying off people treason etc but it lacked the serious ability to engage where it hurts and disapear into the forest quickly now this is viable the most important thing about this that this is only realy feasible in systems you dont live cos you cant really entosis a system where you live it unless you bring everything so yes its refreshing and very fun to do this
moving this to the assembly hallccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
if you need it you live in it if you want it you live in it you dont live in it in either caseeasy solution you dont want it entosied start living in it you dont live in it it will get entosied
fozzie sov is great the big complaint i see is that these big alliances cant hold what they have because they have overreached and have more space than they should if your 1000 member alliance cant hold off a small gang then you have two choices get more members to actually fill the space you have or reduce the sovereignty that you hold so your current numbers can defend it stop crying to ccp because you actually have to work to keep what you have
see its easy you want to maintain your easy gameplayno if we dont live in it it should be easy the problem is that even space people are living in is easy and requires no real commitment id be happy to see active systems need battleship links and inactive systems need rookie shipslol bull youre pretty much echoing gen eve just with slightly better grammar
sure you cant thatUFFFDs why its my stuff better to burn them if i leave then give it to someone else you want stuff work as i didbacking to the point of this thread even if there are half of null sec to claim sov people arent going there to claim it theres too many people like me i assume that that dosent want to be in huge or bigger corps they prefer small corps ccp are trying to force hs people to go into null to big or huge corps thats not going to happen never that people dont want big corps and specially pvp 237 they want to do what they want and what they like not what others want them to dothen and again the lack of mobility to move their stuff into null are not helping at all if ccp thinks that they are gonna sell their stuff to buy new ones in null forget thats not going to happen maybe a few dozens do it but thats allin dominion people are going on null just because they have mobility they enjoy for some safety and everybody has what are looking for i assume that shooting structures for hours is not fun too however that provides pvp if the intention are to defend that particular system now with the all power in only one side of course nobody shows up to defend anything they just dont care they loose it defend it or not you can call them chickens i call them smartsthe real problem in this game are the tremendous power in just one side vs the all other sides its not proportional that is the main problem that ccp must look into first before develop something that can punish once again the same guys but i guess why they dont look into that way its no convenient
what system with people living into it got reinforced what were the index on it when it got reinforced and why did nobody manage to just prevent the reinforce in the first place
dont quote me out of context context is as important as the point when i said its easy i dont meant its literally easy otherwise we already own half of cfc space what i meant its easy to decide why we use corm fleet and not carriers you would be stupid to do so after all you guys have a habit of droping supers and titans on top of us all the time i am sure if the tables were turned you would not drop a carrier vs troll titans and supers i think you personally just destoyer your chances here so you want null sec space without needed to be protectedeasy wowreally do you know that null sec space is suppose to be unsafe right besides all the systems that are getting entosied you dont live in itlol no i am not gen i am well know for how i speak in ts thats me take it or leave it i tell you the way it is and thats iti wont bs you around unless i am trolling you ofcource i also like a good joke and a laugh is there anything else you want to know about me or are you done with the personal attacks
people moved to dominion cos of isk sites used to give double the isk or more people had more alts it really rewarded having many alts things got so bad the hisec wardeckers were complaining they did not have no one to war dec  i remember laughing at that then it got nerfed and went down after that also the new limitations on multi boxing software has reduced this alsothe sites got nerfed big since then the isk per hour has dropped to half since then
so whats the point are multiboxing bad it means more accounts on game which is more incoming money to ccp and you are saying that is badif people are making money in null sec it means that they are working to do so or are you talking about botsbots are used in null sec first and almost of the players that have complain about that have used them personally i never used them but if you have big rich alliances better to start thinking what they have done before for they have all that moneyyou have guys in game that uses multiboxing for pvp are that bad not for me if they have a pc that can runs all the accounts why not its their ships and its their problemwardecs always have if that mechanics are good i dont think so to me tha small the corp is bigger the payment should beif one part dosent desire to pvp theres no point to wardec them they can always bypass the system and not fight wardecs should be made to those who desire to engage in combat and never to those who never engages in combat its very simplebut people tend to force others to do what they dont desire to do then here comes the complains about they not fight etc etc its like in real life some fight others makes the logistics others manufacture weapeons food etc and the big guys the money guys or the parasites if you prefer dont do any  just sit on they chair making enemies and friends for its convenience and profit with the work and effort of everybody elsei will never shipping on that i like small corps small roams and a place where i can call home if its hs low sec null sec or wh its not relevant for now null sec to me its not worth i dont care about get sov and hold it i dont want ctaUFFFDs all the time i dont want everyday to be 4 or more hours sit on my system waiting for the timers end or chasing ceptors preventing my ihub to be blowned up sorry thats not an option to me engage in combat yes but when i want and when i can not when others want just beacause they want
i personally think mutiboxing software is the worst thing that could eve happen to eve specially in pvp it belong in another separate thread i will not go into it cos the topic is not multi boxing
let me speak from my heart in english try to add an opinion from a russian pilot as there are not much of us who bother themselves to write in english i would suggest to start with a smaller change which ive found somewhere on reddit make an attacker pay i would say 300mil to get the structure reinforced the reinforcement start time should calculate from the actual payment the payment should be done before the next invulnerability window of the structure time mechanic here does not matter much it should be only done in a way that does not allow abuse like get immediate nodes spawn after payment the pluses are easily implemented will decrease trolling which in my opinion is the number 1 problem now that makes sov boring will still allow small alliances to venture in a 00 space as it should not be a problem to chip in 50milpilot for a 20 man fleet to take over a system tcu ihub station if they really want to for those who say it is a lot of money get real they will most probably use ships more expensive then that to actually make it happeni also agree on the statements of a tool for sovwar and sov transfer from the petition all the other stuff i would not rush to implement we had one big change done recently so i would better avoid doing more noticeable immediate changes the prove that changes to current mechanics are required is that as far as ive seen the only people who think that current mechanics is working as intended are either those who does not live in null sec or dont get trolled a lot because live 20 jumps away from lowsec all those who trolled and got trolled trolled is the key word here not take over the space for themselves are saying that some changes are required changes and tweaks i mind you not reverting back to dominioni guess the reason for this is that people who didnt participate in trolling dont really understand how annoying that is to make them understand better i would suggest the following joke change a person can entos npc station to get it into reinforce with all the mechanics like sov structures and second reinforce the result of taking over the npc station will be taking away an equal amount from wallets of pilots who has assets in that station with a total sum equal to a cost of a tcu or an ihubwhatever ridiculous that change may sound i can give you some plus points for it will encourage fights we have seen this plus point somewhere didnt we  will make people to only occupy stations that they really need aha seems to be a duplicate again  will free some db memory as people will trash stuff that they dont really need we always should take care of the servers arent we i guess that will swap the opinions and all the 00 pilots will say a great change 1 while all the empirelowsec would say if i didnt notice that there is a rookie ship there  why should i lose money why should i stop doing what i wanted to do and run 20 jumps to take care of my assets and that is the case of a nullsec right now which people who dont live there do not understand it is not that why dont you drop sov where you dont use it it is why would we drop sov where nobody is going to use itpersonally i would be happy to see some empty space getting occupied but browsing through the comments here and in reddit ive seen the only alliance that actually tries to take over the space the corvos and i really admire them for doing that which makes it somewhat 501 trollingreal nullsec venturing ratio and trolling would not get any empty space occupiedthere is also one more problem with the current trolling possibility which i havent seen to be discussed it actually encourages blueballing and noatack agreements between large alliances how is that you would say the point is that as a big alliance you would not start a war against another big alliance that is capable to bring 10 waves of 1000 trollceptors to reinforce the hell out of your entire sov within one vulnerability window and it is not really hard will only make each pilot pay 500mil in case he lose all 10 ceptors this even i after a year of play can handle not speaking of those who play eve for yearsone might argue they can easily defend by splitting over their space and blabla whatever first easy to say hard to do second it will work only until the point where those 1000 ceptor pilots will reform as one fleet and drop the hammer on one strategic and really important system and here will be the deal then will those who split make it in time to reform as one fleet to defend their assets may be they will but what if they wont so in my opinion current sov system increases risks of a largescale war between sov holding alliances making them raise a question why would you start it in the first place and ive got an example where it worked out exactly as i think we stopped our war with tri and solar and plussed each other if you dont agree with that  please give me an example of any descent scale war that is happening nowadays i agree that it is summer right now everybody is new to the system and blabla whatever lets see then if that will change in autumn or not
true i shouldnt have spoken so categorically i keep watching the yrton constellation which now has its seventh different alliance deploy a tcu and youre right a smaller alliance no matter how big wont be able to hold system next to an larger alliance unless the larger alliance allows them to live there even if the larger alliance never uses those systems despite having a tcu in them that does not mean however that the larger alliance should concern itself with contesting timers in those systems every time one pops up a tcu gets reinforced pfft doesnt matter command nodes spawn and sit around for days again doesnt matter hostiles capture the command nodes which pops the tcu but dont put down their own tcu doesnt matter some other random group stops by and onlines a tcu doesnt matter if an alliance doesnt care about a system doesnt have pilots living in a system by definition the system does matter and therefore tcus dont matter roam into it for fights ratmine in it although you wont get the benefit of an ihub of course but get out of the dominion sov mindset that tcus matter for systems you dont live in after so long playing that way i do realize how difficult it can be to let something go that was previously held so tightly but for the alliances sanity its necessary nowthe system is three weeks old we have lots of people playing it as if dominion sov were still the applicable paradigm its the players not the system preventing meaningful conflict right now perhaps you and i have different ideas of what it means to live in a system living in a system means availability to defend it by definition and theres no idle standby required it does not mean constantly orbiting an outpost tcu or ihub you can be in station chatting on comms you can be in space mining you can be in space ratting you have no less than 15 minutes to respond to an interceptor entering system in our null system my fleet is constantly 23x7 on the lookout for interceptors and other hostiles we have pilots spread out across up to six systems we have advance warning it doesnt interfere with our living within our home system its a natural part of our life there we welcome the activity even if its an interceptor we cant catch but can only chase offindeed for example i do see quite a few of bls fountain systems marked red on dotlan due to sma activity no idea if sma wants any of those systems but bl shouldnt have let those systems get reinforced in the first place they have too many systems for their membership levels trollceptors cant slip through if there are pilots in every system you want to hang on to
i would agree on the initial statement that ccp forgot to include tool like who and where been attacked beside the alliance mail i think most reasonable people would agree on thati do however disagree on paying 300m to attack something thats just ridiculous if you think losing enotosis ships plus the rest of your fleet it cheap then good for you only large alliances can afford 300m and god help you if you are going vs a monstruosity that is cfc i can only think that unless you are planning a miraclous return of white noise and the drf i dont see how someone can afford that people complain about not getting enough action and then people blaim it on sov where in reality everyone knows that the new sov has nothing to do with it war creates content and entosis does that exactly you have someone that does not like you and is willing to herass you to death and possibly take sov for themselvesi think taking a station is more that enough punishment for someone not to be able to redock not to mention if you decide to destroy the local eco with alts in it in the future maybe there will be stations that will blow up and you lose everything that we will see another topic for the futurethe whole point is if you dont live in that space then it wont get entosed so why not allow to entosis a system you dont liveforgive me for what i say here but we were roaming in your space using a wormhole several times my god you got so much empty space its crazy i dont know how or why you would put yourself in that pain but i can tell you is that all that space should be used by someone why should you get to keep all that empty space esclusivelly if you want to get more people there and blue ball them fine thats your choice you can always pay them to go away like cfc has done in the pasti think fozzy sov its a brilliant idea and ccp should have done this 5 years ago whats wrong is that alliances keep it and then complain about not wanting to defend it that is wrong its the front lines in null sec it must be very dangerousyou guys have been in war for the last two years i am sorry to say this but you guys did not prep for it and example cfc didcfc was very close like your space before lots and lots of empty space now they still have much but no where near you guys you guys failed at prep and were too busy shooting each other i dont want to be rude or harsh but is the truthsome people are obsessed with this trolling i would say this if you think you are been trolled is cos you have casted a wider net that you cant control adapt its been always the modo in eve those that adapt do better than those that do not
trolling is not an issue if you cant handle a few frig why could you hold your territory all your argumentation is founded on trolling is an issue trolling is not an issue so your wall of text is irrelevantthe issue is not trolling your issue is  you have a bigger territory then you can handlethe proof is  you cant handle a single frigsize fleet
well op made it to csm now it seems  so the balls completely in his court now
i could not agree more just a thought what would happen to a city if there was no police any more or what would happen to high sec if concord was removed all the criminals will move in and chaos descends upon it which is exactly whats going on here
and if you only had to respond to reinforced systems youd have a pointeasy as in easy to take genius read the rest of my quoted post there id be happy to see people take inactive sov with rookie ships but require battleships to contest occupied sovi know youre not youre one of his lackeys
i honestly believe its the lack of required commitment to contest sov weve been saying all along that entosis links should be what make battleships relevant again if you had to drop a battleship to contest sov youd really only do it if you wanted to take the sov not for a troll  at least not too frequentlyand i get that but why bother mining or ratting if youre constantly having to reship and chase around a ship designed not to be caught a lot of people seem to want sov to be a career choice not an entertaining game mechanic if thats how ccp want to take it fair enough but it wont bring in more players
my biggest gripe with the current system is that one no longer needs to commit to an attack previously attacking sovereignity required placing sbus and actually putting some effort into your conquest while tedious it usually meant that someone who went through the logistical and strategic effort of doing so had an intent of claiming sov currently it means that anyone can harass a sov holding entity now there isnt anything inherently bad about ityou can easily imagine  and i suspect the developers imagined it that way when it was first conceived  a situation where a hostile gang rolls in tries to harass a system a local fleet deploys to go and fight them battle ensues one side gets shot at  fun nice content as people are fond of calling ithowever this is not how it usually goes we all know how riskaverse players are and said hostile gang will be of no exception when a response fleet rolls in and the attackers dont have the guarantee of victory theyll simply bail no content will be providedrinse and repeatthe stance on large battles i agree with wholeheartedly the best fights ive been in never began as a consensual hail mighty space foe let us meet here at this node ignore the objective and instead let us joust no they were fights when both sides rammed it down and fought no holds barredthose were the battles that mattered they left the memories of frantic scrambling pings of getin bombarding you through comms hundreds of pilots bridging into a fight reinforcement fleets getting pipebombed by rnkand finally the issue of scalabilitynow dont get me wrong it should take effort to capture or reinforce a system the opposing force should be given time to field a defensive fleethowever a situation of we control the grid control pretty much everything and the entosis link is running on the structure now what now the entire fleet sits and holds their dicks in hands for an hour somehow manages to achieve a level of boredom higher than posstructure bashesin short in prearranged lab conditions that dont factor in player behavior this system is good that said were not in prearranged lab conditions
i think allowing entosis links on only battleship hulls and larger would be even worse for sov holders just like in dominion sov where sov structures were reinforced but then no attackers showed up to contest the timer  that is the blueball tactic we heard about a lot  youll still have instances of systems getting reinforced yet nobody showing up for the timer and the defenders will then have to jump around a constellation in battleships and capture ten nodes thatd be so much worse for defending your sov than being able to use interceptors yourselfalso one of the expliccit goals of aegis sov was to make it easy to take unclaimed space allowing interceptors to claim sov when nobody around is a good thing as preventing an interceptor from taking sov is easy when the space is occupiedsee some people are the opposite of you on this i think some feel that ratting and mining are the dull career choices of eve while chasing interceptors is the entertaining game mechanic we have quite a fair number of kills where a skiff is the top damage dealer we almost always have people docked in station being social who enjoy flying out to an ice belt or wherever and engaging a hostile who has come into system it breaks up the monotony
correctionin previous they did not have to comit they attacked and could leave or stay if they wanted cfc is well know for troll sov aka i did not wanted that sov anyway or was looking for content not sovthe same thing is happening herethe bigest battles in eve for the most part have been escalations one brings something the other brigs something bigger and more and more etc this in no doubt will happen sooner or later if you guys did not blue ball each other it would happen more oftern but here we arestop blaiming ccp for your policies you want content of massive scale fine set a few of your blues to neut and let the slugfest begin dont then wait for it to happen or deploy to an enemies territory just like razor and init are doing
i think the objection is that with letting interceptors and other fast moving ships use the entosis link is that we are still getting the blueball tactic now instead of not showing for the fight the attacker runs from itgranted i agree that if nobody shows up and reinforcement happens and nodes spawnUFFFDthe alliance holding that system screwed up they deserve what they get granted if nobody shows up ever and they lose the systemUFFFDokay again they deserve iti think what people would like is for there to be some chance of shots being fired vs just getting the warning burning to the system under attack dampjamwhatever the ship with the entosis link that then fucks off to another system to entosis the relevant structure thereUFFFDuntil somebody shows up and dampsjamswhatever againmaybe things will change on their own defenders will get better at stopping the single frigateceptor etc from doing the entosis thing the attackers might bring more people and fights will start occurring but if not my guess is that the current version of fozziesov will be changededit typo
with dominion sov the effort to attack sov was proportional to the massive hp buffer of sov structures which was present whether or not the owners of that sov were present with aegis sov the effort to attack sov is proportional to the effort being put in to active defense is there no defense then there should be no effort required to attack got titans supers and a subcap support fleet sitting next to your tcu the effort required to attack it will be extreme no little interceptor will stand a chance if they make an attemptactually i believe what the developers actually imagined isnt that a defense fleet rolls in rather they imagined the fleet is already there in system making it exceedingly easy to chase off or kill a trollceptor or dissuading a trollceptor from trying in the first placethose battles arent gone if somebody truly wants somebody elses sov and the defender truly wants to keep their sov you will get your large pinged fights except that the fights will be spread out across multiple systems and multiple grids of a constellation hopefully with no sustained tidi this is another explicitly stated design goal of ccps new sov systemi honestly dont see how shooting a tcu with guns for an hour is any more exciting than shooting a tcu with an entosis link ive helped take down a few poses and pocos its very dull
sure you might get that but youd get considerably less people trolling to contest sov so you woundnt be chasing trollceptors about all dayeasier than dominion which battleships would be if you cant field a battleship to your target system you probably shouldnt be trying to take sovthey may enjoy it now but after theyve chased their 100th disposable interceptor theyre gonna get bored
it seems this has become eves version of asymmetric warfare where the defender would prefer symmetric warfarethe fact that it is so annoying to major sov holders is the point  they have to address itits a kind of balance to sov sprawl eventually they will get annoyed enough to only hold sov where they have to not every where ever they can
i think if you can not fend off what you call a troll ceptor that has only 25km to entosis then you should not hold sov at least in that system anyways
yep i cant wait for the mittani to spin this one
the system is designed so that you have to respond on attacked before it gets reinforced your indice give you buffer time to form up if needed if its 1 troll only one dude from teh group living in that system need to push him off if you have people living in that system it should not take 40 mins to push off 1 dude if you have enough people living in all your systems that 1 dude cont reinforce any system as he will always get pushed off if you have system where you have nobody living then those will get reinforced because you obviously dont defend them with actual presence this is what the fozzie sov system is about presence in your own systems if you cant push off a guy in 40 mins you obviously dont have a presence in that systemif your indices are up you can even let him get a few minutes of burning stront on cycle and then push him off and entosis it back faster that he did he will dry out his cargo of stront and you can keep doing what you were doing before pushing him its a occupancy system if you occupy your systems it will be easy to handle if you are an absentee landlord you have to deal with not playing the game how its currently designed anyone who though an occupancy sov system would not require you to be in your systems missed the point imo if you have 50 systems and cant keep them maybe you should try to let one fall and see if you can correctly occupy 49 or even less until you hit a threshold where your space is occupied enough that trollceptors cant create such wildfire in your backyard unchecked can stuff be made better about the system yes is the system complete trash not if you actually believe occupancy sov mean occupancy sov the name of the game is to be in the systems you hold not put a flag in them and the dock in your staging for a ping its a rather large difference between the previous sov system and holding sov in unoccupied system is a pita but id be willing to guess this is working as intendedi wonder if you are supposed to use the timer to actively defend the space you live in maybe team five 0 dont know what the goal of those index arequote is from
and once again its not that it cant be done its that its boring a game that is boring is destined to die just look at it mate a new sov system and the player count hardly blipsit call comes down to commitment though an attacker is committing a trollceptor because they choose to while the defenders are forced to commit considerable time sending each one on their way its like sitting around highsec shooting gank ships the attackers dont care that they are losing them and keep sending them laughing while you waste your time if you cant see how a system that allows people in a shitfit interceptor to be a threat to contest space that actually requires a response is a bad idea theres no hope for you i imagine they will make serious changes to it since its clear that most people find it insanely boring
i know the trolling is stupid but that does not mean you cant flat out prevent the node contest from happening i want the devs to make a statement on the trolling tbh so we know if they really want it to stay like that or not i think its stupid but my only idea to really make it less of a pita is to put the same added mass on both entosis link mod so the inty is actaully really burdened if it fit onein the meantime occupancy is the name of the game if you dont want to deal with orbiting nodes someone has to waste 1015 minutes every 40 mins to push the troll and entosis the structure back to normal if someone came
yeah im thinking that it could be good if when an attacker activates an entosis link it must be subject to engagement by whatever the defenders decide to bring until the node is captured ccp has already taken a step in that direction by preventing warp while an entosis is active but something fast can burn away in a straight line and i dont like restricting speed artificially what about restricting how from from the node the entosis ship can travel like the range of the entosis so an interceptor orbiting a node at 7 kms can continue to do so while using a t1 entosis  but could never get further than 25km away from the node similarly for t2 with a 250 km limit that gives the entosing ship the space to operate within its limits and use its appropriate tactics in combat  but for the duration of the capture its subject to remaining on grid and cannot simply burn away in a straight line and to be clear im talking about the capture of the node not just an entosis cycle in other words like a reverse pos shield anybody can land ongrid with a contested node but any ship with an entosis link mod fitted cannot leave grid until the node is either fully capture of defended shenanigans with mobile depots would of course be possible but preventing an entosis ship from leaving i think can provide for some interesting tactics including traps
yep three hels were destroyed in syndicate for just such a reason that being no reason at all other than two sides wanting to outescalate their opponents which is why we lost badly the one time we tried to outescalate some of our syndicate neighbors it was i think the first time any of us had been subject to being doomsdayed instead well take fights with what weve brought with the understanding we could lose it all we can often get good fights that way but we dont escalate
one modification i might agree with  ships with entosis mods fitted lose their nullification ability so trollceptors can be bubbled wouldnt really change much for us though because we send our entosis ships with small gang protection looking for a skirmish
that coupled with vs needed for t2 armor and ivs for t2 shields also cant follow up on the missile sp issue turret supports give you three turretlines for four races missile supports hand you a free choice of weapon systems for three races from a solosmallscale pvpperspective missiles are nearly always the better platform comparing decent v toons vs specs to iv for subcap gunnery and missiles its at 16mil and 11mil excluding dread things
having people required to leave their wormhole to run content through very low spawnrate is necessary for things to happen in wspace people farm their statics some exploit everything in the chain but all leave their homesystem to make isk and get ganked eventually in the process with the exception of the bloated fat kids ihubs would essentially eliminate the need to leave your hole and expose yourself to hostilities
hi everyonei am here today to bring you an important message regarding the removal of a csm member UFFFD gorga the reason for his removal is the unacceptable level of participation that we have witnessed in a past few months while we understand that real life issues can interfere with csm duties we expect every member of the council to participate actively in our internal discussionshis inactivity was brought to the attention of ccp by the csm and after discussing the situation with them and agreeing with their request to remove him from the council for inactivity he will be removed todayas per mechanism that we established last year we are replacing gorga with the next candidate in line we have already rerun the stv script and according to the calculations uaxdeath is your new csm representativei would like to point out that this is not an exception and we will continue replacing inactive members in the future you will be able to read more about these rules in the updated white paper that will be published before the next election ccp leeloo
now only one heartbeat away wrings handsseriously though good that the russians are getting some representation and i hope that hell be an active and contributing member of the csmeve down under  a community for players in the autz
good call although it is a shame to see him replaced by someone who has been nearly as inactive ingame the last 6 months or so as gorga was when he ran for csm xdeaths a good dude though dont necessarily agree with his viewpoints on sov but you need the full gamut of positions to voiced
good move can you also release to public votes  lobbing of the csm members after some feature is released
slightly offtopic here i just bumped on thisi dont pretend to speak for a lot of people but frankly the csmrelated stories the joys of nullsec politics and so on may not be followed by the majority of eve players yes breaking news there are carebears living in highsec and perfectly fine with it some even enjoy it my point being i browse eve forums and the excellent reve and see loads of alliancenullsec content taunts and stuff being posted and i dont think this is really helping the necessity to open the game to as many new players as possible right now it looks like some weird secret brotherhood of people systematically crushing newbies now lets have the 1 or equivalent rain i guess
we are looking into this
first of all the eve forums are not a great place to actually discuss stuff going on in the game the vast majority of subforums are infested by trolls or just totally clueless people who have no idea of what is going on and the isd are doing a subpar job curtailing it there are a a couple decent subs for example the wh forum there is a reason csm dudes and other noteworthy persons the ones creating content for others mostly post on reve which you already read fhc twitter and the likethe reason you see posts about happenings in nullsec nullsec and wormholes is because those people are making  happen they organised themselves into communities that provide content and thus enjoyment of the game they are the ones posting about battles happening because guess what aint no  happening in hisec apart from suicide ganks and market failuresi would also argue that newbie friendly organisations such as pandemic horde karmafleet euni and such are much better for the game than a random mission running hisec corp that no one has ever heard of has no significant internal culture no voice communications etcim sure there a plenty of people who mostly play in hisec and enjoy the game that way while there maybe arent many jesus features like the new sov system for hisec to point to the vast majority of game changes affect hisec too for example ui changes ship balancing and corporation management improvementswe have had a dedicated hisec csm representative in the past and it sucked
if the csm were appointed this might not be an issue but since its elected that means in order for hisec to get people on the council they need to communicate with each other and get organised they need opinion leaders to emerge from their community who publish their ideas and actively promote themselves to their own wouldbe constituents its hard for hiseccers though because unlike more pvp oriented players in whs low and nullsec they tend to stick themselves or play in small insulated groups a committed hisec csm candidate could pull together enough support to get up provided they were prepared to do the legwork over a long period of timein other words  and i mean no offense  but the lack of hisec voices on csm is a reflection on hisec players not an inherent flaw in the systemthat said current csm mike azariah in particular is a great advocate for hisec and whatever their ingame proclivities any decent csm will attempt to look at eve holistically in addition to bringing their own particular expertise to the tableeve down under  a community for players in the autz
looking forward to working with uaxdeath
the dream is still alive
i believe fuzzysteve has already put something in fuzzworks for this
cross post from reve 
regardless of who is affected im very glad to see action being taken to remove inactive nonresponsive csm members those elected should take the work of the council seriously and actively contribute or gtfo
thank you for an opportunity to be csm once again this came unexpected for me looking forward to work with csm x and ccp team ps i do not work for digital forest i own my own construction company in new york which could be read here
uaxdeath congratulations
i dont quite see the problem with this one ccp is currently working on major null overhaul it wont hurt to have a lot of people actively involved in null life in position of sanity check which is part of what csm is
fantastic i very much look forward to this

isnt it the same of democratic elections in any democracy today getting to understand issues and taking interest in representatives takes work and research this is not for everyone and it is up to each of us to decide if we want to cast our votes by blinfdly following a tradition or following orders or doing our own research i somewhat agree with you and i have a more jaded perspective this game is very unique in the fact that it is one single shard and some players have been there for 13 years some have amassed considerable amount of power and influence much like some families of professional politicians have done in rl this is fundamentally human nature the weird secret brotherhood of players is working top continue their domination of the games politics like any one in their position even you would do they do not necessarily crush new players has much as inticed them to join their ranks through all these training corps that are fundamentally funnels for new ingame taxes incomefind candidates and groups that fight the establishment and say they will upheld views you can agree with and support them my top listed candidates for csm x were borat guereen ashterothi and chance ravinne find yours and support them
i think what was being asked for was about the request to have gorga removed for inactivity rather than the actual voting for csm membersif im wrong about that
what is your badlyexpressed point that ccp should ignore the rules skip down the list past all the nullsec candidates with more votes and arbitrarily pick someone who doesnt play anywhere except highsec
i believe karma fleet brave newbies and the pandemic horde would disagree with you on that oh wait they are all null sec entities  i include brave because they may not have their name on the map they will eventually and in the meantime theyre spending most of their time in null anywaycould your view point be because not much interesting happens in high sec and what does can be found on the miner bumping website which isnt exactly a great advert for new players but does give them an accurate portrayal of how to play eve online
was gorga contacted or did he contact ccp as to explain his low activity no details needed just curious
how does lorealai keep getting passed over as a replacement
empty quo wait no
1 actually yes we can shoot it this is more interesting and faster
annoying hassle in most low threat cases let them rf it then see if they actually show up if they do not then set the miners on the nodes they love that boring stuffif the reds show up then n1 and wreck their ships
now that is an interesting suggestion
now that is an interesting responseim skeptical of fozziesov in its current formbut then again something like a sov revamp is going to probably need iterating onin any event thanks for the thoughtful reply
look at that teckos pech praising anything that makes it more difficult for people to do guerilla hit and run type attacks love the selfinterested postingthe imperium has just got on with it and set up their systems adm i have especially noted that exe seems to have been rather efficient at it having done that you just have to maintain it and blap the odd person who wont be able to do anything really in your prime time with an interceptor with your high adm its is perhaps working as intended because to rf your systems someone will have to bring a fleet for grid control i have to ask did mo threaten to hot drop any one not ratting quite a reverse in policy that onefor the past couple of weeks i looked in detail at estoria which is of some interest to me even the die hard mission runners in stain are in sov space grinding and many of their pvprs too its only a few pipe systems which are getting rfd but that is more to keep them occupied so we can do what we want those people no longer have free reign to camp us in stain because we can cause them pain back on the systems they have sov on but dont use so instead of hassling us they are saving their systemsif you make it easier to kill something like you suggest then you remove the ability for people to fight back against harassment by doing the same back hell i have a way of being as annoying as afk cloaky campers to those people who just dropped an afk toon in every system i used and i rather like it and you lot are moaning about it typicalstop moaning your coalition is doing it right and many others too and another thing to note the change in attitudes in this game will be even greater when the new structures come in especially when they are destructible this means that people should keep watching and learning while waiting for that structure change to occur and then see how that pans out personally i think it requires certain groups to die due to boredom before 00 can be fun again i find the concept of people like the imperium pl and ncdot doing whack a mole on any small sov holder pretty boring and that requires a long period of boredom for these groups in only finding one system to hell camp or people using sov in a nomadic way ccp allowed titans and supers to ruin their game coming back from that will take time blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

okay lets think about thisa guys shows up activates the entosis link waits for the first cycle to about finish then burns awaynotice is sent and off he goes to the next structure he does that for as many structures as he can then docks upis it valid sure there are damn few rules in the game and he is not doing anything all that outlandish given the mechanicsis he creating content yeah the people who own the sov will likely have to respondmost important question is it interesting no not really in fact it is rather boringnow im not saying change it ccp im saying my issue is that i hope this isnt all we are going to get out of fozziesov cause if it is that downward trend in players logged init will likely start going down again when it goes down enoughnone of us will be logging in fyi to my trained eye the downward trend appears to have abatedlets hope it continues like that and even goes the other wayyes the imperium is doing okay with this aside from the hot spot in pure blind im hoping it leads to more than just interceptor gangs and other stuff running around using their entosis links or  off i like the idea of people deciding to fight over a system constellation etcim hoping fozziesov will become that but everybody like you having a boner over the current situation is not really a good long term solution to the problems facing the game to the extent that fozziesov results in a more dynamic diverse and interesting nsfantastic no really maybe some of the current alliances will let go of space and that will happen if fozziesov induces some alliances to evengaspbring in people more dedicated towards things like mining im fine with it after all getting some guys out there to mine sites will help push up those indices and hey they can probably build stuff toomaking sourcing stuff locally easier too im hoping this is where fozziesov goes im just skeptical it will after all to get miners and a dynamic and diverse null secyoull also need stabilitythink about it places that are unstable and chaotic are not usually places where you find people thriving those are usually places people want to leave so for ns we need a healthy tension between conflict and stability things stable enough for people to want to invest the time and energy into nsyet with enough conflict for there to fun
that is a better post i am not simplisticly getting a boner over it i am telling you that i can now get back at the people who could and did afk cloaky camp me with impunity which is more boring than what you described now i get into a specific fit loki with 250 km range 5000 ms speed nullified cloaked and cause them pain back on the systems they do not use you know that i will not do it on systems they usemany people in hisec are bored with the goon lead gank campaigns in hisec its not interesting for that group on the receiving end either and it has resulted in people leaving the game should ccp nerf ganking no should they make adjustments yes but they haventin terms of pure blind there is a weak spot poor systems with low adm which are difficult to get up to a defensible level and with good reason its bad space it is also border system skirmish warfare but i spot checked a number of systems before i found a condor kill with an enosis link but is there combat also around the mining sites or the anoms that is also part of the battleground not just the structurei think the downward trend has also stopped the numbers were showing more of a loss of people doing stuff in hisec activity in null has increased however that may be people doing frantic work to get their adm up i am skeptical too not so much at the issues people here have detailed starting off with the op but more to do with the large numbers of people that will come in and hell camp anyone who sets up in systems that they can defend add that to destructible stations which may end up being designed to be loot fonts then one has to say that it will faili think its too early for changes like you suggested but also at some point there will be a fight between people who actually want the space and hopefully without third parties ruining it and then we shall see but with a load of very organised and highly equipped bored people looking to kill something in this game i wonder if it would get the chance to actually happen this system needs time to settle down the imperium are leading the way in how they have structured themselves but i see similar developments in estoria too but i would so love to see a real border war develop in pure blind but i doubt it will happen because the same massive super and titan blob also looms over this system because at the end of the day it is all about grid control in systems that people want to keep and in that case you will get big fights but perhaps you guys wont get them because you are just too strong blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
i have another how about any entosis ship that leaves entosis range without completing a cycle then the entosis module explodes and is permanently lost thats 50 million estimated mod price and a refit needed everytime there is a failed attack
and once again its not that it cant be done its that its boring a game that is boring is destined to die just look at it mate a new sov system and the player count hardly blipsmaybe boring to you but defenetly not to me i am on the offensive all day long you are on the defensive thats what you get for trying to defend a system thats you dont live in i got more than i can handle and i am having fun every nightits early days yet and people are still working it out besides other parts are left also to deployi am pritty sure once people realise that they cannot defend system that are too far they will let go of them
high sec ganking is unfun for the person getting ganked should we ban all non wardec aggression in high secperhaps every person ever ganked by goons should grab an entosis link and go get revenge by attacking goon space in pure blind 
have to admit that this has me quite concerned at this stage im less interested in who is right and who is wrong and more interested in why people arent logging back in the new sov system needs to work from a player count perspective so far it aint
its nothing to do with systems we dont live in even defending systems we do live in is boring nobody wants to chase around nullified ships never did never will its a bad design i understand that you are having fun because you follow your leaders in being overly grr goons so the idea of goons having to waste their time makes you fap like crazy but the system itself is just not entertainingyou keep trying to claim this is about people not bothering to defend or not living in their space and i keep telling you its not about that i couldnt give a flying  what happens to space too far away for us to defend but the system is boring as sin for space we live in you hang around with gen eve too much
thats different though since the players being ganked did nothing to be in that place sov defenders put billions of isk and countless man hours into their space ccp developing a system that favours aggressors trolling and is boring to defend is a bad ideaplease do i cant think of a faster way to get ccp to make changes than to mass troll sov holders to be honest though its only a matter of time if the csm have already been called up on it
did anybody actually expect the new changes to trigger big wars and bring players flocking back the only thing that can make that happen is the leaders of null sec alliancescfc dudes complain yet they themselves create the problem by blueballing any threat fozziesov cannot be judged a success or failure until some major players really try to take sov from other major powerswhy dont non sov holding alliances like pl really test the mechanics by attacking goon renter space in pure blind
its not going to go back up when those of us still playing are telling our unsubbed friends dont bother coming back yet this  is aids and until they unfuck it spend your 15 elsewhere
hello i want an explain about  why in dominion sov mechanic attacking a system  i was anchoring at least 2 sbus that costs around 400milto attackand now in fozziesov mechanic  im not paying anything  i have a system with strategic 5 bridges  capital constructions why someone to attqck my sov shouldnt lose anymoney 
there are a number of other issues that impact player count some people are waiting for the break up of the mega coalitions some people are fed up being ganked some people are fed up with their industry being nerfed and walked some people left because they can no longer use multiaccount control software others because of the toxic nature of some players others because ccp is presumed to be nerfing their htfu playstyle when with the tick box on corp aggrothis new sov system is very much a work in progress and the final piece is the new structures once that is in place then i think people can make a proper judgement and making nerfs before the full picture is in place and the pain is for systems which they dont really use muchthe key benchmarks on success of not will include player count but there are other pointers like for example new entities trying sov space however if they make the new structures loot fonts then while you may be happy for your play style others will say nope blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

i rather like your posts but you say that the person did nothing to be in that place you mean they did not train up to fly a freighter or jump freighter or they did not pay 16 or 66 bn for the ship and they did not work to fill it full of stuff either so thats billions and countless man hours all gone at least with sov you can win it back not the ganked blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
but they have no more right to the space they are flying that anyone else thats the point ships blow up thats a risk we take flying them but with sov people own their space and put a lot into holding it and it should take a reasonable amount of commitment and effort for someone to contest thatnow dont get me wrong dominion was far too much you needed fleets of ships and structures and had to grind through millions of hp that was far too much what theyve got now though is too far the other way all you need is an interceptor and an entosis module and you just burn off into the distance if someone arrives on gridwhat i want to see is a balance between those two extremes aggressors should need to put enough on the line to mean that most people aggressing sov actually have the intention of taking it not just wasting the defenders time and it should be enough to make it worth fighting over without that major sov holders wont fight because theyll be too busy looking out for the hundreds of interceptors swarming their space fights wont happen when small groups attack a larger one as theyll refuse to commit to the attack and the space will be even more stagnant than under the old system
the same comment applies to people who do not use their space if someone has their indexes to the top level then that interceptor is wasting his time and is being trolled back the issue only really arises in terms of space that is not used or which is being camped this is where even people like myself who are sympathetic to sov holders pov go a bit glassy eyed what about a cloaked alt in a rail destroyer or two soon sort that outmy feeling is that the super powers in this game over shadow even this new system because still at the end of the day its grid control that really matters at the moment your leadership and that of ncdot and pl is looking foward to curb stomping someone who has lived in a few systems or a constellation and actively defended it that threat is something that all current sov holders have to deal with so i would like to point at the balance of this small entities can go after space that is not used and harass that space large entities can go after a medium sized entity in a constellation and completely flatten them no matter how they used that space the superiority you have worked up still has its value also your coalition through great strategic play set their whole area up securely and then was able to go around eve with impunity kicking butt you ability to do that is reduced a bit due to this chore but isnt that a good thing for the game that strategic decision on home security also feature and do not rely solely on being miles away from anyone and protected by large ehp and a dominant cap fleet blob in that areathere are many things that may be tweaked in this system but the hit and run ability on systems that are not used much is not one of themas one of the more thoughtful posters i hope you see that blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
oh im right there with you on unused space like ive said i have no issue if they want to make it even easier to take unused space but a disposable interceptor should be absolutely zero threat to used space sov holders shouldnt have to waste time chasing around nullified ships all day controlled by people with no interest in actually taking the spacebabysitting structures is not gameplay remember that this is game and it should be entertaining no mechanics should be built around the idea of someone effectively turning eve into a job some things should take effort sure but it should still be entertaining
as you might know i have been banging on about afk cloaky camping for years where people not playing the game stop people from playing the game yet ccp has ignored any suggestion to deal with it in my neck of the woods certain stainwagon players do a lot of this and with the new approach to sov i can say oh dear a cloaky afk camper in my systems that i use hmmmph instead of leaving my toon logged in and going off to play another game while i assess his likely playing times i just hop into a ship with an entosis link and go mess with his stuff suddenly my negative feelings about eve are improvedi would take trying to kill these people as a challenge and i would use the newer more motivated players to do it sprinkled with a few gungho vets over time this may settle down a bit yes people will still do it to troll but i still think its early daysyears ago in b7 we had some test sbs in system so we set a trap for them and killed two out of the three they came back with a cloaky vaga to add to their fleet and it was fun dealing with that i expect in time that type of skirmish escalation to develop i may be wrong i also expect that people getting fed up with a particular system will just push for a op to get the adm up so as to make it more difficult and hence cause a potential fight while doing that both may create contentat this point people are trolling each other at some point the gloves will come off for real conflict and then people can sit back and assess it properly but so far its only really nibble like conflict in the main though the tri and ra fight may change thatedit i started looking at the pure blind systems under attack and yes it is harassment but i have noticed goon systems losing adm it looks like a harassment campaign that could develop into something more serious should you deploy to provi for example and looking at the kill board for 3v8lj a goon system i saw some some skirmish fleets decking it out looks good to me in terms of making strategic decisions for campaigns which are more than just looking for someone to blap which in truth had turned conflict in 00 into a joke blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
thanks for being polite i do appreciatelet me try to be short hereexcuse me but did any of you try new sov mechanics if yes  can you tell me how was it fun did you try to get any sov and hold itif no  then sorry your opinion is only a theory without any practice backgroundwe had some practice with suddenly spaceships to actually try this new mechanics it produced a hell lot of a boring content so the issue is that current mechanics allows to produce more boring content than the previous one due to a lot more ways to deny fightsand i guess suddenly spaceships also had their reasons to withdrew from that fighting at least now it seems that theyve left it sorry if i am wrong here 
did i try it well i did rf one tcu was it fun yes but that would wear off no i did not try to get any sov and hold it because at this point we need to see how things develop further with a certain erosion of the bigger entities some from overstretch like you and others from boredom because they dont find easy curb stomp fights using their massed firepowerdid i try dominion sov yes was it boring yes structure grind after structure grind with perhaps one lagfest battle which caused a collapse like a pack of cards and your point is what blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
im in agreement with that have posted the same many times but its unlikely to change anytime soon and has nothing to do with sov sov mechanics shouldnt be purposely made bad just because other bad mechanics exist in the gameit might do but its unlikely only the bigger groups are likely to go for an all out war with each other and as the russian alliances have shown they dont want to fight when theres the risk of losing their space in a couple of days to individual layers in disposable ships i cant see anyone choosing to deploy while thats happening short of usi imagine wed have a decent idea of how to cope with both whether or not in happens with the sov system in the current state is another matter that said we only need to send disposable interceptors to hassle people out of their space
what i was getting at with the afk cloaking reply is that its boring and bad mechanics even though the alternative of forcing a log off would be gamed and it is something that will be used against sov because the objective is to attack the development of the adm when it would be better to have rush and grab eventsso far we have not seen anyone go for a full adm system or a capital system when someone has a reasonable force and fights full on for it until that happens its too early to make an informed decision i also think that the go off without any care in the world to mess with someone else for fun mentality sold this very complex game short campaigns now have to be close and focussed along with defence its a very good thingyou guys can send fleets of interceptors but do you even try that against a fully focussed alliance with a core group of pvp players a long way away from any escalation ability maybe you do but that could turn into a turkey shoot of your interceptors your t2 loki works well by the way and that is more of a pain for people to deal with lthe arazu too have you actually done that to someone well away from easy jump range for your caps and larger fleets blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
so basically ignore the objective shoot people instead of playing node whackamole because this is the only way an actual slugfest would happenthis is how you actually lose in this system the system does not require you to fight  in fact it favours evading the fight there will be no slugfest because the aim of most nullsec coalitions or alliances is to winits almost like someone intends to turn the epic war of 00 into a contest where two people beat each other with squeaky mallets seeing who gets driven to insanity and quits first
with the change in the sov mechanics the imperium reduced their space and focussed on getting their adm up however in pure blind they failed the question one has to ask is why do you want to hold on to that space when its so boring to do so well its a strategic need you cannot allow people to sneak in staging poss currently you get it reported with sov but you have to defend that sov to get that report is that the only reason you keep those systems do people want to live in those systemsthose systems are the entry points into your space and there is npc 00 there so you are fighting against those people based there you keep those sov systems to bottle up the mordus legion and to prevent others sneaking in assets to do a surprise dunk where is the value for you is it to keep them focussed on those systems rather than harass your main isk making areas that has a valueso you have strategic value in keeping those systems because they control entry to 00 you have the ease of intel for poss during the current system before the new structures arrive and you keep mordus legion occupied around the edges in that area all three good reasons to keep the fights there perhaps you will not want to explain any other reason and i would understand that for me while it is boring for you those systems which do not have anyone really living there act as a buffer zone this is pure strategic thinking but there has to be a cost for such a bufferwhen we look at the russians who whined here they are just exercising pure strategic judgeement based on the old system their arguments having merit in terms of pure gameplay as do yours miss the impact of how this affects 00 long termfor me its interesting to watch this unfold and its too damn early to nerf the way that people rf things blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
it is definitely too early to make sweeping changes a lot of mindsetshifting is yet to occur that said since were supposed to reduce living space tools to build it up proper should be introduced sooner rather than later
i think what you really want by making the entosis ships battleships and larger is a reason to drop massive cap fleets along with your other friends in cfc again you want it so you can remain uncontested as you were before ageis sov since no one could come close to dropping the number of carriers dreads super carriers and titans as cfc could especially so close to your home systems the new sov system make the playing filed a little more even which lets be honest may not seem to be much of a threat to you now but it will be soon enough especially when the fleets start to become bigger and more organized i can even foresee a new niche being created out of all of this merc corps and alliances built for one sole purpose taking sov from the big and handing it out to whomever pays
no slugfest happen when important systems get occupied pvp escalation happens or you deploy into someones back yard it will happen more of then if you decided to set some blues to neutral since you got no one left to fight at least not any ways near i dont see how you are going to win but not fight i mean to got to show up for to enforce and after reinforce a system you cant win any other way the system does not require you to fight is a fantacy to me unless you dont defend it in any of the two situationsepic battle will happen but it will not happen while every one is blue to each other fozzy sov adresses that by forcing to down size in space
why would i care if were dropping carriers or cruisers either way were going to outblob the opposition the reason i want bigger ships to have entosis links is because i believe that attacking sov is something you should do when you want to take sov and that should require a level of commitment if youre too cheap to drop a couple of battleships what good will holding sov for the three seconds you get to hold it do youand no the new sov system doesnt make it eve smaller guys still stand no chance of taking wanted sov from bigger groups no matter how you try to twist it more better organised players will always win all the new systems has done is allow people who dont want sov to be a threat using disposable ships causing the exact dull and conflictless gameplay ccp have been trying to avoidlol id love to see someone pay several billion to a merc corp to take sov give it to a little guy then watch the big guy roflstomp all over the little guy and take it back if youre too small to take your own sov how the hell do you think you will be able to defend it remember the easier it is for you to take sov from a big group the easier it is for that big group to take it backedit thinking more abut your merc idea the only way that would work if you continued to pay the mercs to defend your space so really if you think about it youre talking about renting
and rolling back fozziesov would just create absentee landlords who dont have to defend their outlying renter territory from any low scale harasment
which is why im not asking for it to be rolled back i have no problem with unused spoace being easy to take but attackers should have to actually commit to attacks otherwise conflict wont be created as weve seen people will just fly around in cheap disposable ships trolling
ya know it would be sort of funny to charge isk for using an entosis link i mean it costs money to declare a war pay bills use security tags form alliances and corps and maintain them i think it is a valid point that sbus used to cost money there was at least some ante on the table even though a few billion is actually fairly trivial it wont stop dedicated trolls nothing can and it doesnt give much player vindication you still wont be able to blow most of them up but at least it could detract a little bit from people who have no incentive and no cost other than time to go nuts honestly we need more isk sinksthe ideas to disable nullification on entosis are pretty good dont get me wrong the onus of defense should be on sov owners but it may be a teensy tiny bit tilted to attackers now
thats something i can get behind i dont think anyone in wh space wants nullsec style sov but things that make a wh system feel more homely would be good
that is the best thing about itas for the rest of your post iain already covered it pretty well
null sov war impacts everyone in eve except that subset of supernew players that choose to live in highsec and ignore nullmy alliance primarily concentrates our activities in highsec with a moderate amount of lowsec and occasional wormhole activity we do not aspire to own sov and allow members to be loyal to whatever sov holders they want or to none yet sov affects us considerablymany of the uh clients of our ganking services are transporting items that are being imported to or exported from sov null changes in null industry affect the prices we pay for tech 2 blasters morphite is 12 of the build cost of light neutron blaster ii and particle accelerator units are partly moongoo derived and are a significant component tooive never fought in a null fleet fight yet every time one happens i watch to see what interdictors are lost en masse and start making them in big numbers yes i have 200 runs of each interdictor bpc preinvented for this very reason i also made bank out of selling goons meta 4 sensor disruptors at extortionate prices during the halloween wareven if you have no interest in personally participating in nullsec blob warfare or even in leaving highsec it creates opportunities you can seize

i understand what you are saying and agree to some extent however they can do what they like if they want the towers to have the option to get reprocessed they can or they can lock it out there are things that can be done to help the items noted but the suggestion gives more than one avenue and a profit to the person that takes the time to find it and hack  salvage it i said after 30 days so you would have the opton of blowing it up or taking it down and putting it up for yourself or whatever just like your shield reduction  if not both i would just like more uses of hacking and salvaging and these are two options with benefits

1 to petition sounds like argis sov is broadly meeting its objectivessov nullsec was not a vibrant content rich environment it was a blue donought where occasionally everyone would gank someone out of the club
i think you do care whether it is carriers or cruisers after all your modus operadni has been the super cap blob where in years past it was blobbing sub caps by various other entities cfc took it to a new level with the escalation from sub caps to blobbing caps and you did it very well but the fleet composition of the entosis fleets now keep you from dropping caps to a certain degree which again makes the field of battle more conducive to smaller corps alliances and gangs in general ageis sov was intended to open things up for everyone else and so far it looks like its on its way to doing so while those in cfc or whatever you call yourselves now may look at it as just a pain in the rear for others its creating content and its a way for the little guy to hit the big guy and im willing to bet we will see some really fun battles in the near future you only have yourselves to blame for this cfc and i thank you on behalf of myself mordus angels and the rest of the little guys out there looking to take swings and land a few at the big bullies out there
i think you missed the point no matter what ship types are used our response will be the same blob the  out of it the only reason ship type matters is for commitment right now attacking sov requires no commitment a solo guy can set up and alliance and contest sov on his own without losing much when hes undoubtedly stopped this is why sov trolling exists and why most people attacking sov have no intention of fighting  thus create no conflictif however people had to commit a moderate amount of resources to attacking sov they would have a reason to fight for it and thus conflict would be created dominion required alliances to commit far too much fozziesov requires far too little somewhere between the two is the right balance and the one im fairly certain ccp will find in timeand i get it youre super excited because you can make goons react to your existence but its not creating the type of content ccp wanted to create rather than look for balance youre just sitting there patting yourselves on the back more likely because your overlord told you to rather than because you actually believe in it yourselves im sure even you guys will get bored of mining structures before too long and youll realise that what were pushing for is whats best for the game
always makes me laugh seeing lucas talk negatively about overlords when his alliance is part of the biggest feudal society yet created in eve 
anyway im done with this thread op proposal gets 1 from me make entosis ships lose nulifier immunity and destroy the entosis module if the pilot has to flee out of distance without completing its entosis cycle also cap the amount of capture nodes in space to 10 throughout the constellation at any one time and have a new one respawn every time one is captured
some of you have talked about rentlordswell that is te only one option that many corps have to go on null they have no pvp guys on their corp and probably they dont want to make pvp at least on a daily basis with this changes renters have left just because rentlords cant reach everywhere and renters are not going to fight back so if their system are constantly in reinforce mode why stay in null and why pay for a system that dosent provide enough is to pay the billsuntil all the parts usnderstand once and for all that there are at least two kind of players in eve the hardcorers pvperrs and those who dont wish to pvp we are going to see many threads like this one and others well knownedthis new sov mechanics are not going to attract new players into null it will make the oppositei guess the problem we are talking about here are not only this sov mechanic theres something wrong or broke behind that and ccp needs to find what are wrong or broke and fix itsov in dominion only can be contested if the attackers want to take sov even if they transfer that sov to anybody else but that costs isks now eveyone can contest the sov not take it its free of charge and do that everydaysccp want to take isks from game its easyas the null sec has pirate faction they are legally the owners of that space instead of caliming sov for alliances make a sov claimable to corps where those corps have to pay the feeUFFFDs to those pirate faction in a proportion that have been charged to the renters by renterlords those npc provide all the upgrades they control the sov unit and the ihubs corps pay the upgrades onde they pay the upgrade are working the npcs can provide more services like patrolling space if the renter corp wish to pay for that and so on moonmining are only available for the renter corp and no one else can set posUFFFDs on that system and you will see the alliances dropping sov new players going into null etc
nothing wrong with leadership mate its how the world runs too the difference is the level of control pushed down by people like gen eve and gevlon which prevents your members from being able to form their own opinions i frequently disagree quite publicly with members and leadership of our coalition and theres no way id accept being told what and where to post like you have been plus lets face it your leaders are considerable more childlike and neckbeardy than ourscareful you might get yelled at and lose your funding
thats actually not a terrible idea it might pull in on a bit of the trolling given that the entosis module usually costs more than the hull its strapped to when used by sov guerrillas since thats what they seem to want to be called id still like to see prop mods disabled completely when running the link but one step at a time eh
thats an interesting idea that i think merits further considerationin the meantime with entities like noc and bos getting involved in multibillion isk fights the most recent being 280 pilots in costolle destroying a total of nearly 200 billion isk over a period of 70 minutes sometimes over a pos sometimes simply from the result of two groups trying to outescalate each other i cant help but snicker at sov null pilots who whine about a single interceptor interrupting their ratting and mining sounds like theyre better suited for highsec life null needs more of the kind of pilot that finds chasing an interceptor interestingi think i understand why bos is saying that getting kicked from cfc was the best thing to happen to them
i am 100 positive that the recent bos fight had precisely  all to do with interceptors lasering a node the big fights have been caused by poses and money moons for a long time now in that regard absolutely nothing has changedi can count on one hand how many people have said that chasing an instawarping nullified ship is entertaining they also happen to be the same people relying on those ships almost exclusively funny how that works out eh
exactly big fights will still happen when both sides are willing to commit  that hasnt changed with the implementation of aegis sovwhat has changed however is the ease with which alliances could hold on to systems they dont use once the alliances get tired of defending such systems well still get the big fights over valuable resourcessystems and well still get the big fights just for fun and smaller entities will be able to carve out small niches for themselves
you will until newpos ends up turning all structures into a node mining quagmire then even those will likely stop since there wont be a reason to commit large amounts of assets to attacking and defending those eitherwe shall see and i hope youre right but i know better
the problem i have with this logic is that it breaks one of the more interesting design decisions of aegis sov which is that the defender decides how many resources the attacker has to commit in order to take the system at least within the limits of the defenders ability to do so is your system undefended then why shouldnt some random in a frigate be able to take it from you if you ignore every chance the system gives you to to defend itis your system defended then there should be someone there or at most a jump or two out to shoo away the interceptor before it can do much of anything as it happens the perfect answer to the entosis interceptor is the even cheaper t1 ewar frigate unlike the attacker you can have a big stack of them in your station for anyone to grab and use you can even get fancy and use eafs or ewar cruisers entosis the station to stop his progress then damp him until he has to turn off his prop mode to be in targeting range or just hit him with ecm and force him to go through warmup cycle after warmup cycle troll the troll then if its a vanguard for a serious attempt at taking your system youll be seeing a fleet before long if its just someone buzzing around theyll go awayits just natural that a wouldbe attacker would not blindly commit in the face of a response they cant reliably anticipate anymore than you would fully commit to kicking a hornets nest before you had any idea how many hornets would come out of it
you mean the citadels i see it playing out similarly to tcus and outposts  alliances that want to hang on to their posequivalents will need to have a constant presence in the structures system which will promote consolidation and gives local entities the opportunity to acquire them from remote entities anytime theres a real push from one group to take over a moon from another group who wants that moon there will still be a big fight keep in mind that ccp has explicitly stated that one of their design goals for aegis is to change how big fights happen so that they dont happen on a single grid in a single system and instead are spread out across an entire constellation
even if an attacker had to commit more that would still be the case all it would do is raise the minimum for an unused system the commitment should remain low but for a system that is used the defender shouldnt have to go chasing every disposable frigate entering the system one of the perks of system ownership should be that it requires more work from an aggressorhave you done this though sure its easy enough to defend its boring as  though you already know from the moment they arrive that youre not going to get a fight youre going to get them evading you as much as they can and then likely cloaking up even if you do manage to get a point the attacker loses effectively nothing without the need to commit to an attack there will be no real conflict generated by the mechanic
it does regardless its not like you cycle the sov lasers once and everything is yours but the whole point is to make the obstacles the other players and get everything else out of the way if there are no players defending the system then the obstacles put up by the game are trivialbesides what requiring battleships will do is go all the way back to requiring overwhelming force because unless youre picking off a border system that you know will not be defended and how would you know that you dont send a single battleship thatll just get picked off at a gate on the way you send a fleet with support how big well if you want success then it has to be bigger than any predictable defense which because thats hard to predict means that youre blobbing as much as you can remember the odds are good that the locals can muster caps and supers more easily than you can and if you cant muster that then you dont even try and there are no smaller entities taking sov and theres no conflictand without the ability to poke the system in relative safety to determine how eager the owners are to defend it there will also be no conflict thats the problem nobodys going to leroy a fleet of battleships into a system just to feed you they only will if theyre convinced that you cant answer what they have once you think of the interceptors as scouts possibly vanguards the system makes more sense the fleet doesnt show up until the fc is convinced that he has a good shot at winning or if the fc just wants a fight hell want to know that the defending fleet will make for a good engagementi would welcome tweaks that reduced the level of tedium but i like the idea that the defender sets the difficulty too much to compromise it
a solo pilot can contest sov in a disposable frigate while he might not take it he require a response every single time from a defenderif you owned a pos and i kept flying up to it and shooting it with a frigate and you kept chasing me off would you have to keep doing it forever no youd realise im just a frigate and ignore me until you needed to respond so why does a pos require more to threaten than an entire systemand no having to have battleships would simply mean that attackers would have to attack sov properly and would create conflict all they are doing now is triggering notifications and running away when defenders arrive its whackamole sov and its bad for the game the playercount not going up for such a pivotal change is a sign of how much of a failure it isoh bull nobody is poking a system to find out how many defenders respond the fleet doesnt show up at all because the people sending the interceptors have no interest in soveven if an attacker needed 1 battleship the defender would still set it they might respond with just 1 man or they might arrive with 250 battleship or a full on super fleet whatever the minimum bar is set at the defender will set the difficulty between that and the number of members of their coalition
if chasing a lone interceptor is that boring use some of your rentercorp tax earnings to pay somebody isk to do it it cant be any more boring then shooting npcs in a haven
alternatively well just do what weve doing crawl into an even igger blob of nonaggression pacts and roll in isk through renters if ccp leave in terrible mechanics well simply opt out to the extent we can and it will be worse than dominion i doubt they will though as they have sense enough to want to drive conflict in null not drive further stagnation so look out for the upcoming changes
just thought id share this from another threadso people are willing to hellcamp npc stations for a whole month with no pvp content to destroy an enemy yet the same people wont chase around a lone interceptor i think this goon just blew the arguement about entosis wars being boring out of the water
we do chase lone interceptors the difference between that and this is that hellcamping is something people choose to dot sovtrolling is a design flaw that all sov holders are forced to deal with bad design is bad design its going to get changed its just a matter of time
wouldnt suprise me at all to see ccp cave in to nullbears like yourself but it wont be good for the game
of course it will be games being entertaining is pretty much a musthave them making the game less boring is a good thing even if youre so grr goons that youd rather see the game die
it shouldnt suprise youif you know a single thing about the production and economic aspects of this game it shouldnt shock you in the slightest
there is something to keep in mind keeping people in ceptors happy trolling sov or changing nullsec so that it will be a diverse and interesting placethe idea of a diverse and interesting place is a ns with more people in it overall that is the idea of a fallow system with an outpost as a fob for either a war of aggression or defense will no longer be a thingUFFFDto have ns be like that you cannot have too much instability people dont make huge investments in terms of time and in game resources when things become more risky and the rewards stay the same what happens when the members of an alliance think their alliance is about to cascade move a bunch of ships and assets into their sov or move their  someplace safeer what happens when a ns alliance gets war decced in hs do they move more stuff around in hs with inalliance characters or do they switch over to safeer ooc alts preferably ones in noobnpc corps or maybe make use of red frogthat is why the linking to the ns statement on themittanicom was a bit disingenuous imo that entire document was about moving ns to being more selfsustaining more developed and having more people in ns and yes it seems the alliances in the drone regions are woefully behind the ball on pumping the average number of people in their systems

good day fellow playersnow that jump fatigue has been out a while ccp are setting up to take another swing at the mechanics they released in the phoebe updatewith this in mind ccp larrikin has asked for a round table to be setup for players to give feedback and ask questions regarding jump fatigue this will take place on a teamspeak server on wednesday 12th august at 1700 eve time we hope to also stream this on twitch at the same time but no guarantees the setupduring the round table itself we expect the discussion to be quite heated at times due to this we the csm as a whole are hoping to moderate the server to keep the discussion going with this in mind we are asking you to submit questions in advance doing this will be of great help to us and larrikin after we have covered these questions we will then move on to other questions and feedback from people who are on the teamspeak server itselfsubmitting questionswhen you are submitting questions we ask that you keep them constructive and on topic yet as short as possible to allow for as many questions to be answered during the round table we also ask that you keep the thread as clean as possible and clear of any unnecessary moaning so we can wade through the many posts that we expect to be seeing alongside this if you do not want to submit your questions in the thread itself you can also send questions to your own csm representative ingamewe would like to close submissions of questions on sunday the 9th of august at 2359 this gives us the csm a chance to make sure we get all the questions into a document and submitted to ccp larrikin first thing monday morning giving him time to formulate answers before the wednesday round table after closing of submissions we will aim to have the question list we submit to larrikin up on a google document for you all to see and prepare for on wednesdayafter the round tablethis round table will be recorded and uploaded on sound cloud for people who canUFFFDt attend alongside this a written transcript attached to this thread in the days following the round table details on how to listen infor those wanting to listen in to the townhall you can keep track by listening on twitch at

in the run up to the round table are ccp able to release any stats so that we can potentially put our personal experiences in to context how often have various fatigue thresholds been reached in each of the months split by ship type  number of jumps made split by ship type  for cap fights above some meaningful threshold what was the fatigue min  mean  max fatigue of pilots on their final jump before combat for various fatigue thresholds if the pilot stopped jumping after hitting that threshold how long was it before it logged in  undocked againthere are likely other stats that would be useful which others will think of
i will ask
what are your feelings on the jump range changes and fatigue changes as implemented now in fozzie sovdo you think the time investment for moving to a new area is fairwhat are your feelings on the fatigue numbers for black opsare you happy with the way the fatiguerange changes make certain groups basically unassailable as a follow up as more groups start realizing where they are on the hierarchy they spread out to avoid conflict with any group higher up making it borderline impossible to force anybody into a fight is this intended are ccp happy with thisdo you think its healthy for the game when the typical response to having some fatigue and not being able to go on another drop or op is to just log off and play something elsewhat are your thoughts about a heavy reduction in fatigue while jumping into or out of your capital systemthere are probably more ill think of eventually
thanks i went back and added some more im pretty sure others will pop up too if you give it a few hours 
please do ill update my statment to working on it 
now that you have implemented a system where you have a capital how would you feel about some kind of fatigue reduction when jumping out of it
questions are always good to see statements are less good as they dont give insight into the whydetail is good
what are the two best and the two worst result youve seen as result of the jump drive changes
why are we asking ccp questions a question is a really strange way to share feedback or experiences shouldnt the developers be asking us questions its rather passive aggressive to have to warp an experience that demonstrates the negatives of jump fatigue like a group finding it easier to self destruct a capital fleet into a questiondo you think its a good things that players have decided its easier to self destruct capitals than move themthat ends up much more sarcastic sounding than it needs to be
given the developement of various space chokepoints as a result of the reduced number of viable transit paths through low is there any thought to adjusting range to increase potential pathsas is we have places like aradia making the life of a super pilot one of waiting boredom and debating suicide
what are your thoughts about heavily reducing the jump fatigue andor increasing jump range on certain ships jfs black ops etchave you heard the community response that these changes have made moving from place to place much more tedious and unfun if so have you taken it to heart and if so again could you please be better at communicating weve heard you itll take some time to dial in changes but weve heard you and are working on fixing it
i am sure ccp falcon can handle the sarcasm hes really good at it how satisfied is ccp with the changeshow have logistics changed morelesssame jf logi more wh logi more local productionhow long will ccp resist demands for fatigue reduction modulesdrugsimplants my preferred answer would be indefinitelywhat about these new structures stargates in particular are they planned to behave like normal gates or like current jump drive mechanics with fatigue and timers
remove fatigue from jump bridges and enforce that only subcaps can use jbs like this you maintain a check on power projection with caps which is ok while simultaneously giving an incentive to hold sov it will also create significant content possibilities as sov systems with jbs in them will become strategic hotzones for attack  any entity serious about taking sov in a constellation or region would need to focus on cutting off those systems first do this
whats the future plan for jumpfreighters 
are ccp happy with the chokepoints 5ly creates
what are the unintended consequences of the jump changesgiven that there are two mechanic changes fatigue and range does ccp feel they can keep the goal of reducing teleportation ability by reducing the penalty of one of themhas ccp given any thought to how demographic changes of the player base age available time the political situation larger blocks and jump fatigue may lead to less conflictwhat are the plans for jump range and the rorqual its usefulness continues to be reduced and ccps reasoning for giving it a short jump range revolved around its possible use as a battle platform which is not the case rare circumstances
do you feel that jump fatigue hurts the casual gamer who only has an hour to play a night and therefore has to rack up larger amounts of fatigue over a shorter period of time is fair i for example can play 1 hour a night on weekdayswould you be considering to have a severe reduction or removal of jump fatigue for jumping back to the system you originally came from considering that the whole thing was put ingame to stop capital gangs travelling to other regions at a rapid pace i dont see how this prevents it and would help with local capital warfare and moving ops greatly
which issues can ccp currently identify with the existing jump mechanicsiewhat are the significant problemsweaknesses with the current jump mechanics as from the perspective of ccp
does ccp have a metric on rough number of subscriptions lost due to pheobe changespheobe and isboxer ban were so close it may not be able to split those 2 out though
one thing that i think should be added is a reduction of jump bridge fatigue based on index levels that would encourage people to use their space even more added benefits are always a motivator for over all usage
isboxer wasnt banned as a whole but the keyboard and click broadcasting feature was if i remember correctly isboxer automatically disables that feature when eve is used with it i could be wrong on that front though
how did ccp think fatigue would affect players in lowsec who like to use capitals and why does it seem like our playstyle is of late being consistently  on when their intent appears to be fixing sov nullsec issuesdoes ccp think that the balance team have the manpower and capability necessary to balance this game when so many veteran players seem to doubt it and unsubscribe
is ccp willing to consider changes to the base mechanic or are they more interested in tweaking timers and exceptionschange of mechanic example jumping once out generates fatigue but returning to the system via gates or jumps that you started in will give a significant fatigue reduction jumping from your home generates fatigue jumping again away from home generates exponentially more fatigue jumping back towards home only generates the standard amount of fatigue and the final jump home results in a significant reduction in the total amount of fatiguebalance could be an increased amount of fatigue gained when heading further from your home but fatigue should be capped at 24 hours cooldown it can still climb for the purposes of increasing the jump reactivation timer but losing a month of capitaljumpbridgetitanbrige playtime is very harshsubtle plug 
there are two camps first camp is the people who are against hot drop central where people would drop a dozen capitals to kill a ratting drake
thanks to the smashing success of jump fatigue merch industrial consulting services has developed similar additional mechanics for ccp to considerwe suggest fleet warp fatigue  every time a fleet is fleet warped every member of that fleet receives fatigue that prevents them from being fleet warped this will drastically increase the requirements for individual player piloting skill ship hull fatigue  every time you die in a ship you should receive fatigue that prevents you from entering a ship of that hull type this will drastically increase ship diversity market fatigue  every time you modify an order you should receive fatigue that prevents you from modifying another order this is actually a good idea specifically regarding jump fatigue our main interest will be in ccps rationalization behind how a given change is intended to affect player behavior
phoebe jump mechanics have introduced natural chokepoints in regional geography postphoebe smaller groups can in some cases feasibly use capitals by properly monitoring and controlling these chokepoint systems without fear of being blindsided a consequence of this is that some groups will find their capital fleets trapped in a region if they become surrounded by hostiles other groups sometimes find the effort of moving not worth the trouble even if it could be done safely the result is that capitals are often confined to a region without much hope of ever leaving is this a case of jump mechanics working as intended or does ccp hope to make the movement of capitals out of a region more viable does ccp ever intend to introduce something that can replicate the functionality of a prephoebe suitcase carrier
i actually like that last one
1 who in ccp actually thought it was actually a good idea to use boredom and tedium as a balancing factor in a video game2 why havent they been fired
thats not a terrible idea but then again i dont think the best way to fix things is to add fatigue to them maybe just further extend the wait time of modifying a single item five minutes  i think   seems too short for a single item
i am just going to say i am semi happy with the changes and yes its a pain to move but then moving something the size of a small town should be
that was 3 years ago in lowsec on a station why didnt the drake just dockthose who do not adapt fade away we do it all the time but within our own region due to the range nerfthose were more than likely alts sitting there while they play on other characters no one would sit their only viable character on a titan for 15 hours unless they were doing something else attention spans are not that strongthe cold wars have been over for a long time especially after the jump rangefatigue changes the huge news worthy battles are over they will never happen again thnx ccp the only regimes that are dying or gone and forgotten are the ones that failed to adapt to the changes over the yearsthe troops are leaving huh do you mean all of the alts that people used to be able to usewhy would those of us that survived the changes want things back the way they were deklein is a literal fortress thanks to ccp and we are actually using our spacei just had a few questions about your post and thought i would clarify some things for you no pissy attitude implied
is ccp happy or even aware with how the changes altered jump bridge usagewould ccp consider changes that rightfully prevent eyeofterror multiregion jump highways but allow a return of inregion mobility ie like no fatigue for inconstellation bridge jumps greatly reduced fatigue for jumps between neighbouring constellations and slightly reduced fatigue for inregion between nonneighbouring constellations
q i have long since sold all my capitals and capital pilots as they are not in a good place right nowis there a chance that we could ever get back closer to the way things weremy feeling is that the problem before was archon blobs and supercap blobs crossing the map in minutes yeah that was a problem and screwed up the game i feel like the fatigue approach was too heavyhanded in that it penalized all ships with a jump drive and not the blobi would suggest an alternative to the current system the more caps in fleet  the more fatigue you accrue make it really really hard for a 250 archon blob to cross the map kinda like the way it is now but let a solo guy move himself finesome would say welp everybody would just move their cap blobs without being in fleet but then think of the logistical nightmares of everyone needing their own cyno and not being able to coordinate and defend well against a trap or drop thanks for taking another look at this
oh hey my training in parliamentary debate finally comes in handywould the honorable gentleman not agree that a mechanic which encourages selfdestructing large assets rather than moving them is suboptimalmy own question can you give us statistics about the use of black ops jumps and bridges in the month before fatigue and the month after are you happy with the effect fatigue had on their use
two main statistics im interested in average amount of jumps per player per month or week for example before and after the change actual cap use before and after the change maybe from killboard data or some other internal ccp source and a questionwould it be possible to maybe differentiate for fatigue timers between jumps to normal beacons and covert beacons
that sounds pretty awesome however that sounds like a system that can be abused rather easily ive got a couple fun ideas already
generally these outreach efforts are a follow up they are follow up to conversations and conclusions already reached by the internal audience ccpcsms and now validation of findings and discovery of areas of community pushback is done with the round tableso if we could cut to the chase  what changes have already been tentatively announced by ccp or suggested by the csmsobviously wing and a prayer for an actual answer here since it seems every time a csm talks about changes they start with im under nda but my personal feeling isgrabbing popcorn
i would ideally like to see jump timer replaced with a reduced utility modifier ex instead of being forced 7 days to jump you simply have a x reduction in all damage remote reps self reps nuet ability etc and limit it to a max of something reasonable like 50 let us keep jumping for fights what would ccp think of something like this change
what is the expected logistices role of carriers at this pointthese ships are literally named for their ability to carry and move other ships across spacethe jump changes appear to have greatly limited the usefulness of this ability the trend appears to be more tilted toward the use of jump freighters to move all objectthe logistical difficulty of even moving carriers between regions is limited by chokepoints in certain areas and 10 jump paths is leading to greatly increased insurance fraud and moves that often simple leave capitals behind for the next inhabitantswhat is ccps vision for how carriers are used  moved across new eden
the affect that jump fatigue had on my playstyle was servere and although a lot of you dont agree with hotdropping as a passtime in eve its no longer possible to play that way with the time i have available in an evening since my after work wind down eve has changed for the most part to other more time efficent games because of fatigue i no longer really have the motivation to play at weekends as any action i get then may stop me playing at all for the next week if i do get the chance in the face of recent events i would like to think that ccp values its vets and following the anouncement of this thread i am excited to see the playerbase respond with its suggestions and possibly even the chance to play eve again the way i love it taking much loved content from your bread and butter players with 4 accounts is not a good buisness stratergy if there are no players left who will buy the skins your making all your money on right now 30 day trial chars i think noti like the idea of removing fatigue in exchance for an extended fixed jump drive cooldown period and ranges for dreads supers and carriers to be extended back to its old value this would alow the big tidi entities to get to their fights within a reasonable timeframe and move ops to be less painful for smaller groups it would also bring back more local hotdropping and blops with triage as it is know loved and feared throught eve with the recent removal of the need to fight for sov or indeed anything at all i think that the jump changes are just another way of stopping fights happening it was these huge super brawls that got eve in all the news and setting records dont forget i also hate the lack of options available on jump routes now not only has a move op to help a friend taken me almost 2 weeks i have to use systems now perma camped and set up to catch heavy assets i know were not desputing thera here but with that wh acting as a instant free no fatigue titan bridge to almost anywhere in eve any changes to titan bridgejump range and the fatigue it generates is minimal as its no longer the fastest way of getting to a fight unless its at very close intended ranges
were starting with player involvement so when we sit down at the summit were working off of all of this instead of just our pieces we can always shut it down and go and make decisons but i like it this way weve already started so we might as well keep going
if you aint gonna listen to me the first time im not gonna tell you again
has ccp given any consideration to removing jump fatigue and merely having 5 min reactivation timer
i think it might be worth screening the questions to remove the deliberately agendad ones entering a question that submits the answer itself isnt going to do anything valuable and will just waste ccps time for my own questionsthe changes have seen a renaissance for the use of capitals by lowsec groups in lowsec does ccp think this is a good thingif they plan to increase jump range with attendant impacts on lowsec how do they plan to mitigate thisalso sugar you tease sneaking this around p 3
have consideration been made to make jumping a bit more unsafe as it stands now you can undock wait for session timer and then jump this makes using a jump freighter between station systems virtually risk free save for an unlucky bump this applies to other classes as well a timer where a black ops fleet cant insta jump to a super tanked t3 would give time for a mining or ratting fleet time to respond to the cyno in both cases a timer would make really safe actions unsafe and make eve a bit scarier and riskieralso t2 bowhead with similar jump range to jf
most capitals are already going to be on grid for 5 minutes anyways siege or triage cycle but something like 10 minutes would be a more balanced idea
we are making a master document of questions not just reading the forum posts one by one it is not a single persons project which means all of our varied views will keep the topic at the top and not agendas except for the agenda of looking at this mechanic
this is a great idea but people can ask a valid question and propose a possible answer at the same timewill you also be trawling for potential mechanics changes from this thread to supplement questions
1 do you consider creating new smuggler gate connections to remote regions like paragon soul  omist  outer passage cobalt edge branch  deklein  period basis at current jump range  those regions are to far for logistics to be contested by any one 2 do you think that is possible to introduce very expensive price similar to carrier hull capital rigs that will increase jump rangeyes this is only to bring back carrier ship hauling you need to have 34 midpoints to move yourself in 1 region  stain 3 if you consider reducing even more jump freighter range  will you also adjust map  add few systems move them a bit  so regions like stain and regions that use stain as logistic midpoint  will not be cut off from npc supply lines without npc supply route  for many groups  the only possible way to have logistics running will be only by having more blue  all along the route 4 do you think that giving dreadnoughts increased range  and fatigue reduction can bring those ships back to more common use they are defenseless without sub capital support
what are the overall statistics for capital and supercapital participation in combat before and after phoebe have they been participating in fights more less or about the same some of us are certainly using them less have they seen more use by smaller entities who are less afraid of a response from one of the major allianceswhat aspects of the player bases response to phoebe are what you expected and what has surprised youwhich goals of yours for introducing phoebe are being met and which arent and what adjustments do you think you could make to meet more of them
but what are we questioning we are asking ccp about our experiences over the last 89 months asking for stats and hearing about what ccps opinion is does nothing to clarify how the player base feels what we see in this thread are people morphing examples of what they dont like into questions so the answer that ccp larrikin gives doesnt actually matter the important thing is that the intent behind the question is noted an event where ccp does more talking than listening does not seem like a good starting point
the problem comes when people answer their own question as if it is the only answer still i think ammzi has the best question so far id like to see an answer to which issues can ccp currently identify with the existing jump mechanicsi would also like to see what successes has ccp identified with the new jump mechanics
i doesnt hurt if people want to answer themagendas can be valid yes i believe rob was more speaking of nonproductive agendas aka trolling or just snarky anger a question and proposal isngreat how and why you got there is also useful to me due to the thought processesconsider this a mingling of our normal soundboards in a more townhall format we did not want to restrict acess as we need to in an open discussion forum this is a big topic but we are going to take it on we would like to be as smooth and productive as possible along the way
dont worry until we call the whole thing off because of one persons approch 
what are the top 3 issues that ccp feels needs addressing in the next balance pass
these are good questions but there seems little point in only trying to find out what ccp thinks about these mechanicsgenerating additional questions with either possible mechanics or questions about implementation so faredit also i did sat proposed but i take you point on people saying their way is the only way
note i cant fly any jumpcapable ships so i have no personal agenda herewith that out of the way has ccp given any thought to more interactive or tactical penalties than watching the pretty timer count down either making a more and more complex minigame out of traveling to the destination or penalizing the accuracy of the jump whoops wrong constellation should have slept more or anything like thatmore fundamentally i guess my question is even given satisfaction with the outcome of the jump changes is ccp investigating refinements with similar effects but more engaging gameplay
keep fatigue increase jumpranges basically ccps mechanic forces players to give away their account details when they are on vacations oil rigs and military deployments to move capitals so they are not stuck without cover when their alliance moved during their hiatus
no you are absolutely correctso maybe i should say isboxer most used feature banned although screen management still oki think 99 of people know what is meant by isboxer banor maybe they dont i dunno
here is my question has anybody at the csm and ccp considered the simple idea that jump fatigue is actuality ok as is and does not need any more tweaksfor me i see it as ok for my current play style it has had a positive impact where i live in black rise i can now go out in battleships if i so choose solo and not be in so much fear of a capital blob drop yes i mean blob not blops yes i know it can still happen but due to fatigue the bigger groups who like to use that sort of play style now choose to save the fatigue for the bigger fish this leaves me free to pvp at the level that i am able to fieldfor them guys that are bitching about fatigue and range i only have 2 things to say learn to use gates and learn to probe wormholes i am a believer that ships in space  more fun for all them that stay docked up and only jump from station to station just want no risk logistics well htfu as i have had said to me many a time eve is hard and we all like it that way
thats why its an open call 
q will ccp take action on admitted account sharing
the stacking timer has got to go or eased in some way fatigue on blops makes no sense and has got to go too
might as well expand that to ask what the future plan for capitals is period
me my personal view is that people have come to rely on bridging way to much and once it got nerfed they struggle to cope
how does ccp think about a exponential fatigue generation in combination with longer jumprangesmarking the current jumpranges with current fatigue while allowing further jumps with old ranges maybe even more but dunno 10x the fatigue to allow stragglers catching their mates at price of fatigue the math would bring much lower fatigue for short jumps this would add some extra salt to route planning 
blops can we get a look at returning them to their small gang deep strike roots the reduction in fatigue they get currently is nice but after jumping youre still stuck where you are for nearly an hour unless youre going to jump straight home and be done for the night this pretty much makes blopdrops and blopsbs tiny dreads with slightly better range and escapea blops gang that lives in catch should be able to make even afktars in fade nervous
folks i am one of the people helping to collect the questions so you know i ignore people who cannot follow basic instructions i am collecting questions if you write some commands of what you want done i will pass over you and go on to the next person this is not your oppostunity to give orders it is an q and a sessionnow i know you lot are intelligent enough to write specific ideas in the form of questions and i welcome that flat out ccp do dis just wont make the cut    any questionsmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
the game is more balanced now but the price of that balance is just ridiculous the pace of this game was slow enough before the changes but now i find myself playing other games while waiting for timers to count down anyway questions for ccpwhat is ccps plans for capital pilots to still have a place in the future of evewhen will the revelation be less terribledo you think it should be safer to move super capitals solo or should people that miss moveops just unsub
100 this increase jump ranges of carriers and dreads titans and supers not so much but taking 11 cynos to go what used to take 3 cynos is actually disgusting and for example akkio to todifraun 1 gate jump is 3 cynos sometimes ccp u nerf things a bit too much xdim aware this isnt a question however i do mean it more as an observation
but bp there is a gate or there used to be one when i live there did you blow it up 
i did start mine with a question before going off on my demandrant
my questionccpcan you come up with a way to increase the imagination of players so they can discover ways to play the game other than sitting in capital ships waiting for a timeras a suggestion for an answer i would propose you introduce the following into the gameevery other kind of shipthanks
will ccp consider returning the original jump ranges for caps i think the fatigue does a very good job of balancing the power projection and i would leave it alone but current range of caps precludes even jumping out of lowsec to null in some most regions
the issue has never been jumping into fight with a fatigue timer the issue was moving multiple jumps in a quick time a 5 minute reactivation is actually not bad means 5 jumps  25 minutes which at current jump ranges is not a terrible proposal 10 minutes is something id expect if dreads and carriers are given old carrier jump ranges
could be fatigue reduction in some way a bonus for holding sov in 00 space 
agreed discussion and ideas have already taken place give the player base the ability to react to these while adding any additional questions or concerns they may haveedit  id also toss in that discussing the phoebe changes in isolation without regard for what may or may not be coming with changes to capital and supercapitals makes it difficult to really evaluate whether or not range and fatigue is where it should be there is a lot more to the issue than just revisiting fatigue or range
maybe there is more than one issue here with more than one solutionnow another question from me for the thread and perhaps for the soundboard alsoi think my biggest issue here is not knowing what ccp intends for and from jump fatigue mechanics id like a response to what does ccp believe is the point of jump fatigue mechanicswhat are they meant to achieve beyond moving from a to b taking more timea firmly stated concept by ccp of their aims is good for all of us because csm and ccp and perhaps the players can come up with ideas existing in this nomans land of confusion does none of us any favours
hello so heres a thought why not keep fatigue in place but return the range back to 10 light years instead of 5 
i personally am a huge fan of the impacts jump range decrease and jump fatigue are having in lowsec i would like to see it stay as it is until caps and supers have been rebalanced if they are going to be
yeah why are the players asking the questions dont you all want to know what the players think hence youre the ones with questionsheres a question what are the changes coming to capitals and supercapitals so i can better frame my questions regarding how far and what fatigue should be incurred when they are jumped
could you consider adding a branch of new ship specific skills that could somewhat curtails the effect of jump fatigue when trained
black ops could use some love the jump fatigue reduction is amazing until you realize that your range is also quite big  so you wind up with roughly the same end resultare there any plans to address this particular issue
this is a townhall type thing dirk like a podcast it is better to have a dialogue consisting of a chance to ask questions rather than giving folks a rant stage that is why the questions are being collected and sorted and presifted getting a dev to take time to answer some of the questions coming up is a big thing imho and i do not want to a waste it or b turn it into a sidetracked discussion thus the moderation i actually do like to know what the players think and they are welcome to send me opinionsrequests anytime but this is different and tell me that you cannot think of questions whose very content do not let the person being asked know exactly what you thinkmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
what are ccps plans to offset the emptiness of null that has been exacerbated by shorter jump ranges making null bigger and more empty follow upare ccp now ready to take meaningful actions to drive more people into the area of the game proven to inspire newplayer acquisition or are they content to just tweak at the edges of jump and sov mechanics use only null carrots and no hisec sticks and ultimately leave it to player groups like brave newbies to be their overall player growth strategyf
can we have some way to alleviate the fatigue we rack on
why have you not iterated at all or taken any kind of feedback on phoebe in the year that has passedallow me to quote the devbloghahahahaahahahahyeah rightyou said you were going to iterate and consider feedback yet you have clearly not done any such thing why
side track  most awesome name ever
just one question  what are your thoughts on reintroducing suitcase carriers in some shape andor form maybe by introducing a t2 variant of jump capable bowhead in order to make moving smaller ships easiermore viable for people or maybe giving rorqual such a role by allowing its sma to take any kind of ships
ah you can almost smell the agenda oh wait you can still the emptiness of null is a big problem and my since were now onto the unrelated questions questions is this with the jump fatigue mechanic changes when does ccp plan to remove any region without a gate to highsec or lowsec this would provide the competition and pressure for resources that is sure to create good fightsfeel free to edit the above out if you want oh wise and powerful isdsmy real question can ccp create different types of fatigue to inhibitencourage certain behavioursif so can ccp create relations between these types so gaming mechanics is impossiblewe dont want to create a blops fatigue reduction only because people will just abuse it as a semisettled jump bridge network from station to station
although the csm may not share the same thoughts could you take a look at jfs and consider making logistics more of an investment instead of a risk free teleporting box that you can jump almost without penaltymaybe apply more fatigue to it and increase the number of null to low or null to high wormholes to offset it and apply more risk and therefor content generation
1  please consider revamping the ranges associated with phoebe2  fatigue is suppose to reduce power projection which it has but moving caps at all is now overly tediousmy suggestions would be 1  tie the fatigue to the ship instead of the pilot2  boost jump ranges for super capitals to 10ly regular caps to 78ly3  rethink what fatigue causes jump reactivation fine max it at 8 hours not 30days plus
maybe you can use your imagination and figure out that different people like different aspects of the game maybe if you used your imagination you could try and contribute instead of shitposting
jumpfeighter it seems to me that the current jumpfreighter fatique mechanic is not going to stay as it is is there already something planed to reduce either the jump range and or increase the fatique per jump or a timeline when ccp looks at jumpfreighter the next time
if you actually enjoyed different aspects of the game you wouldnt spend your time sitting in a ship waiting out a timer complaining about your singleminded gameplay being hampered and then not even playing the game as a result that attitude is the exact cancer to eve that these changes were designed to destroy working as intended
q when phoebe changes were originally unveiled all ships were being reduced to 5ly except black ops range after the epic threadnaught from jf pilots i believe ccp fozzie said that he would temporarily be giving jfs 10ly while they sort other aspects of the new eve eg things like material availability in different regions where are we on this roadmap if the plan is to now keep jfs at 10ly will you reconsider the rorquals position since it is an industrial ship with only 5ly rangefang
the rorqual was given the 5ly range because of fears that the drone damage bonus would make the a rorqual a gank machine and the whole process of limiting power projection would be derailed so since we are playing parliamentary procedure i guess the question would beis the rorquals drone damage bonus still considered too strong to allow the rorqual to have a 10ly range would you need to remove the drone damage bonus in order to give the rorqual a 10ly rangeof course this lacks the context of talking about what emergent roles the rorqual has lost due to being kneecapped at 5ly so the discussion ends up focusing around the drone damage bonus instead of how the ship is actually used and how that has been negatively effected
remove the drone damage bonus this has been said by others many times also stop rage nerfing its functions clone vat bay recently nerfed with anyone making jump clones anywherewhy not give us a rorqual rebalance as you kept promising us my questions still remain valid id like to hear about the roadmap and where we are on itfang
if i had to guess the rorqual revolves around the new structures they wont announce anything until determinations are made regarding moon mining arrays all from what i get is nda maybe a year basically
q is there anything being planned to make capitals more mobile placing their threat range somewhere reasonable between local and globalsupplementalso we went from massive capital fleets being omnipresent everywhere within 15 minutes to capital usage and movement being extremely localized dropping capitals in certain areas is currently hilariously safe because there are no other capital forces within 10 ly that can actually punish such vulgar displays of power which should not be the case obviously having the dreaded 15 minutes till pl arrives was also not good we need a happy medium instead of stasis caused by everyone is everywhere all the time we have stasis because everyone is nowhere all the time its hilarious that people are better off literally self destructing and rebuying capitals than trying to move them its also hilarious that since there is no threat of a capital escalation ratting carriers are essentially untouchable barring gross human error and negligencethere is a goldilocks zone of capital mobility we are not in it too far to fast and capital usage becomes impossible outside of the biggest coalitions too small and you get capitals being worthless or too difficult to punish increasing all ranges by a small margin would probably be a good thing and tweaking fatigue numbers to be slightly lower
different people enjoying different aspects does not indicate that those different people enjoy multiple aspects only that those aspects are different for example i enjoy capitals and battleships both have been  on repeatedly by ccp but only caps and bridges apply to this thread goons weaponised tedium but ccp are trying to make a game based on it
with grinding taken away from eve what are you plans for supercarriers would you consider making supercarriers motherships againmake them ships that give a boost to range and a reduction to jump fatige and stuffwould you also consider turning fighterbombers into a capital sentiesthere are no stupid questions just stupid people ccp goliath wrote
you must be new to evethe pos code is so old and so fragile that ccp has decided not to fix it and has planned to replace them with citadelsthere is no point making suggestions about pos as they will eventually be deletedyour idea is not a new nor original suggestion it just isnt going to happen
no hardly newwhatever changes are coming which i like can be included in some capacity im sure it can and we dont have all the details of the future changeschanges for poss doesnt mean the same thing wont occur with the new set up go beyond the negative and try to be positive in the thinking how can something like this be incorporated for the future when is that going to occur next patch next year what about in the meantime  is it a easy change way to much to go off of rather just your simple explanation of why it wont work
the thukker component assembly array exists because lowsec capital builders cried out that the reprocessing and industry changes in crius had completely destroyed manufacturing therethere was a huge dumping of capital and capital component bpo by lowsec industrialists closingup shop many were listed at below npc cost ie the effect was real and it was of disastrous proportionsif the array were allowed to be used elsewhere then other changes would be required to maintain the lowsec benefitsi dont imagine this happening it is just too much trouble for no point whatsoever after the required nerfs ccp ytterbium wrotethukker component assembly arrayas we mentioned some time ago we are also going to introduce a new type of component assembly array to help lowsecurity capital ship builders to compete with the reprocessing changes
you are absolutely correcthowever the same inequalities that were existent in lowsec are also existent in npc nullsec and wormholes yet they got the big fat fu all i am trying to advocate is leveling the playing field amongst all entities as compared to sov nullsec
so it seems not all of lowsec is created equal i was just told there are places in lowsec you cant anchor a thukker array as wellhophib which is you look on dotlan is a 01 system in game it is 01 but on eveeye it is a 003 00291thukker restrictions are 01 to 04 which in ccp means 005 to 045 most likely as that is how they round off numbersyou cant anchor a thukker array in hophib feshur egbinger naga karan yekh balas vestouve sakht anath yiratali am sure there are more systems like this but it just goes to show the restrictions are pointless in the sense of anything other than high sec and sov null i dont think anyone will argue they should be allowed in those 2 places
oh look at that all the way back in march almost as soon as the dev blog came out i was looking for alternatives and compromises to fix an obviously terrible sov systemwands have fixed timescant improve your ship to finish a node faster or to repair it fasterit provides a griefers paradise i believe i started using that phrase along with whackamole sov firsti suggested before that the developers maybe take a month or two to play eve more code less and really think about things before pulling the trigger and dumbing down sov
not only the drone lands from east to south its the same guess the populated area should be north and west guessing why this sov mechanic have been released when theres one colalition that cant be defeated ccp heve been making mistakes during years and still ongoing to make some more better leave all systems that are not in use and let ccp see with is eyes that nobody are going to claim that sovUFFFDs maybe those who like this sov system will go there claim it all
lol what is this do you call that group the collective of old isk and stable renting empires fozziesov was supposed to hit people like you and this post is a mere confirmation of its working not that your arguments got no substance but that list on its own is a hilarous collection
yeah except even sion agrees with a lot of what hes saying and has stated as much here
this is starting to remind me of when i reach the top of the tech tree in some sim or the get the best gear in some rpgit gets harder and harder to find the game funkind of like in eve once your alliance has all the best gearafter awhile you find it hard to keep doing the same ol sov hp grind so you complain for the devs to come up with something betteronce they do come up with something better and you find your best gear isnt really needed anymore you say who in their right mindid rather grind sov hp in the best gear than this even though your complaints about the old system got us herebut i think the issue goes back to what i was saying before how once you get the best gear and top out in the game it can be hard to find the game still fun it increasingly becomes harder for manywhat do we do well we could keep trying to find a way to make the game fun again for those who have the best gear though i think that would be far harder and never please any sense of a plurality of eve players especially when more and more have the best gearor we could zero the clock in a sense kind of like starting a new instance in that favorite sim or rpgand i dont mean a reboot of the game that could be even more challenging to find a happy plurality of eve players than a whole new sov mechanici suggest we get rid of all current supers and titansgive owners some very high percentage of estimated build costsrefund sp and cost of skill books for titans to all playersallow them to sell or keep the mods on their ownbring back titans and motherships as unique items that require some special component found in exploration to buildand are removed after extended periods of nonuseand keep the new version of sov with improvements over timeso sov still doesnt need to be a hp grind and now we have some best gear that can be owned but only a set number can exist at any time so we dont get into a situation where everyone has the best gear all the timewith only one titan and mom per major faction we could have 6 12 or 18 different ones that could significantly influence battles but not normally decide themso the best gear would be very hard to get for any individual and can change hands due to destruction or terms of surrenderthis idea could fall like a lead balloon but i think the idea that it gets harder to have fun in a game once you have the best gear is a valid one at least for many of uswe could keep kicking around ideas and kicking the devs when we get the chance but i think the problem is more within ourselves as to why this game has become tedious for many of uskind of like when you reach the top of the tech tree in a sim and have nothing else to improve i think the solution is to limit the top gear and allow it to change handsthen only a very few are affected by this and the rest of us can vie to dethrone themthis could go a long way to improving the game for all and no longer having it as super caps online as some like to call it
goodbye economy
now that fozzisov is around can we get rid of fatigue completely
can you boost all ranges to 10 pls and make this game enjoyable again
q what do you think about removing titan bridging completely in combination with making carriers  super carriers literal carriers and forcing pilots with their ships to board them in order to be jumped to a fight in a destination system it seems like it would put capitals on field and give them a real role againps recommend 79 ly for dreads  supers and 912 ly for carriers regardless love the current fatigue system it has given us back in general though the ranges are slightly too short and some of the chokepoints are currently extremely difficult to navigate
since questionshave you considered the fact that a large number of alliance logistics jf pilots will ragequit if you drop the jf range even more and the effect this will have on the average small alliance in deep null
i prefer the way that it is now if it was any different small alliances would be completely afraid to use dreads or supers again that was not good in order to protect their dreads and supers everyone got into shaky blue status with groups like nc or the old cfcthe only changes that i would prefer with jump fatigue are changes to covert ops bridges blops are too risky to use now and take too much time blops used to bring a whole lot more content i feel like blops are the unfortunate bystander victim of the phoebe jump fatigue changesotherwise the only thing that i can think of is reducing the fatigue for dreads and carriers but keeping it about the same for titans or supercarriers the new range limits are great though
is there any way to eliminate chokepoints that must exist it makes owning supercapitals really difficult
making a game play aspect boring and time consuming in order to balance it is a terrible game design choice no matter how you look at it
why is ccp tending to balance by tedium lately ie jump fatigue and fleet warp especiallydid ccp consider nerfing the power of blobs instead of the projection
a set of kindalinked questionsis jump fatigue a needed evil because of the current state of capitals or is it felt to be needed even if capital fleets werent in the state they currently are could a heavy rebalance to the nature of capitals see jump fatigue removed or are all future thoughts for capitals being supported on an assumption jump fatigue will remain in place in perpetuityis any full capital rebalance dependantreliant on the complete rollout of the new structure systemis it in our interest to support as earlyaspossible removalreplacement of poses in order to get capitals rebalancedrationale it has kinda been my opinion that the problem with capssupers is they are balanced around the abilitynecessity to damagerepair highhp structures this means they need massive dps which means they have to have even more massive ehp to survive the dps of their own class with the introduction of entosissov this fundamental underlying requirement is going away and once pos are fully replaced and removed there will be no need for this massive structuregrind dps how this relates to jump fatigue is that it only seems needed due to the massive blocks of highdps invincibility that full capfleets currently represent if that could change and i personally believe once pos are gone it can it doesnt seem so mandatory anymore
i really like the geography phoebe has created it has even helped break up the giant coalitions all of this is good i see people complain about logistics but remember logistics is directly related to power projection do we really want to shift things back towards this
phoebes jump mechanic changes is the best thing what happened with lowsec in the last years these changes greatly increased the number of small capital fights occuring in the regions with low security everyone who live in these regions and have jumpcapable ship can now use it without constant threat of nullsec blobbers coming after big ships in next 10 minutes as for nullsec people who live there are now feel completely safe and they use capitals in any way that you can think of and they dont even have to think about consequences of camping gates with titans and so on nullsec dwellers from the fartherst corners of the galaxy simply cannot lose a capital fight unless there is a sovwar there is no way to bring capital reinforcements to tenalceparagon soulomistmost of deklein and many other regions unless you live around claim holder wouldnt it be any better if nullsec had a 5075100 jump range bonus for all capitals that could do good for both  claim holders and those who want to fight with them
how does one nerf the power of blobs without it being extremely arbitrary
blobs are powerful when no one can reasonably assemble a like force if you could assemble a force that rivals the blob then you can fight right now in order to fight a gate camp with titans and sc it would take 2 weeks to move to a system close enough to make it in one jumpgate camps typically dont last 2 weeks or if they move gates it takes another 2 weeks to move in range of that
so will this be council of nullblob management whining until ccp caves in and reverts the jumps changes are the days of cap blobs travelling across the map in 5 minutes back soon
fatigue is a necessary mechanic in my opinion however its nowhere perfect right nowobviously giving all ships the same fatigue amount is somewhat off and punishes a lot of specially younger people who do not understand the mechanic however i would not remove fatigue completely from subcaps as otherwise it would be abused again for an organized entity it would be pretty easy to build up a titan highway through lowsec  npc nullsec to project subcaps fleets virtually everywhereso i would suggest to somehow tie the fatigue generated to the mass of the ship much like wormholesin addition to that jump bridges should generate a lot less fatigue the routes of jbs are fixed and they are basicly stargates with an access control list unless ccp wants the playerconstructed stargates that soontm will be released to generate jump fatigue aswell jbs should have no fatigue eitherthe stakes to install jbs in the first place are already quite high
im not exactly sure how to phrase this without it sounding like it has a bias to it but with the current jump ranges fatigue and distances between regions is the reduction in power projection outweigh the pain currently involved with massive alliance or corp moves
there are some corps that offer exactly thati can for example refer to this
sovereignty blockade units were made reimbursable through npc trade i would like to see obsolete bpos original blueprints able to receive a reimbursement option as well i understand that bpos are not packageable but something should be considered to make this possiblethank you
asked and answered about a month ago
this is the same type of rounding error that prevented moon miners from being anchored in 04 systems for years
this thread needs more support come on peopledmc
just want to remind people how goons fight wars and why fozsov needs to stay quoting from the infamous thread on reddit about goon tactics pre the recent changestheir whole tactic was to bore attackers to death now the shoe is on the other foot we get so many tears
love how this thread is hidden in a forum only nullsec alliances tend to read nothing fishy about that at allyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
what response though undocking an alt in a maulus you dont have to stop what youre doing you dont have to form up its an interceptorif somebody really wants to mess with you they wont send a trollceptor theyll park a cynoequipped covops in a safe spot in your system and go afkbecause ccp is completely changing the way players interact with structures a pos is an oldstyle structure that has overstayed its welcome by a decade or soif you want to understand the change just look at dominion sov as ccp intended it they were certain that the giant walls of hit points presented by structures would deter players from destroying them they would essentially be passive while players fought players well that didnt exactly work out so now there are no hit points theres just a module whose entire raison dUFFFDtre is to tell the server that youre there to assert a claim on a specific thing players can shoot other players or station services if they prefer thatif by conflict you mean that they could be picked off by bomber wings on region or constellation gates sure i understand that the imperium would very much like to defend at its bordersconvince me that anyone is going to send that many billions of isk your direction at that warp speed without a fairly high assurance of victorysay gained by sending a frigate ahead to provoke a response and relay it back if you were to go and take a system and you had to have one battleship with a fitting crippled to accommodate this link of yours what would your support fleet look like what would be a reasonable number of pilots how much isk would you be willing to put on the lineyou say that theyre running when defenders arrive why are you bothering to muster defenders plural its free intelligence for your assailant and for an interceptor with comparable tank and dps to a venture its entosis link can be trivially hard countered by absolutely anything with a t1 entosis link undock a maulus lock the station turn on the entosis link lock the interceptor turn on damps orbit the station at 500 run a small shield booster if you want to just in case the interceptor pilot loses his mind and decides to attack with his dozens of dpswhat am i missing
youre missing the 499 times you had to do that since last thursday in a adm 6 system real exciting gameplay there right boy what a conflict driver just look at those battle reportsits only because of their stupidity that theyre able to be so sure of themselves the trial  franz kafka
any response is bad back in the day a single person coming into a system in s crappy frigate going im gonna take your sov lololololololololololol would be ignored as they are no threat now they are as much of a threat to sov as a solo titan is a response is forced by the bar being so low and worse will result in no conflict in nearly every case as theyll just run away and cloakwhich is fine though i dont like afk play but thats another matter because they open a choice you can leave ignore them or hide until they go away ttrollcepors dont give that choice not chasing them means you get reinforcedso under he new system when the new style pos comes out youre expecting them to be able to be taken out by a lone frigate too in less time than an entire system can beby conflict i mean ships exploding one way or another thats not going to happen when they can just as easily contest sov with a ship designed to run away those players serious about taking sov are attacking with fleets that should be how contesting sov at al works sov is an alliance level activity it should take a decent amount of investment to do and how much you are willing to put on the line should be dependent on how much you want the systemthey plural are running when defenders plural arrive this happens in multiple locations at any one time yes each one only requires one ship to respond but in all the places it happens it require multiple responses
yeah that could create some high inflationary pressuresanother option would be to refund majority of the costs via game time except a titan would result in well over 5 years game timenot too sure how many would be happy about thator just give them plex but the plex hoarders would probably hate thatmaybe 2 yrs free game time 24 plex and some limited bpcs of a alliance tournament quality ship that only goes to them would do yeah well anyways im getting carried away herei still think what i wrote holds true but compensating those who currently own them is a complicated issuehow do you do it in a fair way that doesnt create havoc somewhere else in the game
do you have an idea without ccp giving the players money just curious
are there any major technical hurdles to implementing the tether system distance from starting point so that you can move around the same region much better but harder to go far
some regions are grossly different sizes if you are at the edge of a large region you could go the other way and leapfrog 2 regions
as a point the changes in geography have very little to do with power projection and far more to do with the aegis sov system you have to live in your space in order to hold it rental empires full of renters who wont fleet up to defend the space cant be defended by landlord alliances  the entosis links have to be in the rental alliance this doesnt change even with the ability to project forces across the map in minutes if you dont have the population density to hold a region you wont hold itnor are the power projection changes the cause of the break up of the giant coalitions the cfcimperium didnt break up and n3 is currently in the process of reforming as pl gets ncdot settled back into delve next door to darkness guardians of the galaxy coalition i expect once ncdot is firmly in place theyll be joining the guardians who theyve helped in multiple battles alreadynow to the questionone of the explicitly stated intentions of the phoebe jump fatigue changes was the limitation of power projection across the map while retaining the use of capital ships in a localized defensive role the 5ly distance certainly helps with that however the fatigue often winds up having an excessively chilling effect  especially given the need for relatively rapid response for entosis defense capitals are already an extremely poor choice for carrying the link itself a t2 link will lock a capital in place for 20m minimum  1 10m warpup cycle and then the active cycle which will have to run to completion regardless of whether or not the structure requires only 30 seconds of entosis work to fully restore this has an overall effect of making these ships largely useless for defense against the harassing tactics using small light fast interceptors that were warned about  and which have emerged en masse despite widespread claims by the community that these tactics would be impossible and efforts by the devs to ensure socalled trollceptors would not dominate the entosis meta put simply the capital ships cannot provide the ability that would seem their primary advantage  the ability to leapfrog across multiple systems in order to defend nodes while subcapital fleets pursue intruders more directly they can jump once and then wait an hour before attempting to get ahead of the interceptors a second time lets face it an hour later that interceptor or group is probably long gonewith this in mind is there a possibility for tying jump fatigue to the adms for the system you are jumping out of possibly via ihub upgrade considering that capital systems are also frequently market hub systems this would also have the effect of improving the ability of nullsec entities to support and maintain local markets and local manufacturing  another stated goal of the phoebe changes as the intent behind the inclusion of jump freighters in the fatigue was to make deliveries to and from highsec less desirable than local production and so stimulate local manufacturing
i have one question although a bit of offtopicwhen the iterations of jump fatigue and aegisov are done what will be the next thing null security space will absolutely need from ccp so the rest of the game keeps getting just random scraps of content
well at the time fozziecosov was announced i remember ccp saying that jump fatigue didnt go with the sov changesis this ccp attempt to justify removing fatigue or are they just collecting tears
resourceincome distribution and a balance pass on the 2 aspects you just mentioned should about cover it then ccp can ignore 00 for another 5 years as they did between dominion and crius and then you can go back to saying that youll definitely absolutely you really really mean it this time quit eve for ever and ever if you dont get wis or wholly instanced pvpfree grinding or whatever other windmill you want to pay ccp 15mo for the privilege of tilting at on these forums
i hope this dosent get lost in the mess that this thread is bound to become ok ill start this by saying in all i like the jump changes if it was a choice of having them in the game and having not in the game i would keep them they addressed a major issue of the game and solved it my question is regarding the collateral damage caused in the process by this i mean black ops and jb networks they have lost there effectivness and usefullness and ause barrier to participation ie i cant go with the fleet through this jb because i have a timer they dont so i get left behind and go back to the station and spin i can not think of a solution that would solve the issues entirly without bringing back the old issues but here is my 2 cents and my question is it possible to change the system so that the amount of fatige reciveed is in relation to the mass of the ship jumped and the distance jumped rather than just a base multiplier times distance this would help negate the pain of traveling around in own space to join up with people by useing small fragile ships but more importently further incuraging black ops use but keeping the fix for capitals
please please please dont allows this round table to become a bunch of the big ali guys wining over there super fleets they were nerfed for a reason guys so get in a real ship and put some effert into playing the game no more we win buttons for the large coalitions is this rearly engaging content for both players
q will we see the other industrial ships get the 90 reduction bonus eg mining barges exhumersq will we see the other other industrial ships get the 90 reduction bonus eg navatis mining frigatesq will we see shuttles and or newb ships get a 9099 reduction in jump fatigue q could we see a 50 fatigue for logi shipsq what are the chances of having jump fatigue removed from alliance jb networks all together or having it tied into sov levelsq are we likely to see a reduction in capital jump fuel isatopes required per jump now that we have jump fatigueq will the monthly ihub upgrade bill and cost in materials to build said upgrades for jb beacons and cyno jammers be reduced due to the agis changes eg jump fatigueq will we see drones being reinstated for supers and dreads now that their movement is more risky and there are less structures to grind or will they be given more high slots or turret hard pointsq will we see high slots and hard points added to freighters and jump freighters due to the new risks they must face being encouraged to go gate to gate q with jump fatigue reducing the amount of surprise hot drop ganks are we likely to see a deployable mobile local scrambler structure not scoopable half a days life span scan probable that hides local count like how local works in a worm hole
my isusse was not so much with the jump fatigue and more to do with the nerf of jump range why couldnt you leave the range that we had before and scale up the fatigue instead on the current basis of rangeapart from that i support the changes and like tha fact that people can have localised combat without having to maintain an ultra large watch list for all pl and ncdot capital pilots but i am aware that many people have lost the chance to do fun so you might want to allow one jump without jump fatigue to 5 ly based on the current jump range and even if you put it back to what it was start it after the first jump of 5ly blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
i dont see that as being too bad the regions that are huge tend to have one really exploitable link inside anyway
5 ly for carriers seem a little excessive what about 75 ly max skilled but on topic at least give us a skill to reduce jump fatigue timers andor the exponential factor that goes into it as for big blocs using it and possibly exploiting it yeah it happens but so does that one or two guys that fleet up without jc 5
has ccp considered the dual role of carriers in logistics vs combat roles there is no other way to transport assembled shipswould they consider a module rig implant perhaps that allows for a longer single jump perhaps some modification to jf that allows assembled shipsperhaps logistics and combat should be further separated not sure of any of the above solutions just food for thought
i think this is the opposite direction that we need if you want small ships to get around your own space use an interceptor frigates and destroyers dont need any help traversing space at this point if you are going to look at differentiating subcap fatigue bonuses it should be based on class so as a question would ccp consider giving subcaps different fatigue bonuses based on class if so would you consider doing an upside down pyramid approach giving the larger ships a bigger bonus as travel with these is more tedious than travel with smaller shipsthe heavier ships get bridged into combat the lighter stuff travels by gates essentially this is an extension of what we have with capitals already
thats ok we can blame isboxer sub losses on phoebe anyways to help convince them to reverse this awful change i want my power back
weve gathered all the questions posed so far and now we are putting them into subjects so that we can have some cohesive structure also the discussions between questions are useful thank you for participating
forgive me if this has been stated elsewhere the threadnaught is too longi would like to say that as a low sec resident in the amarrminmatar warzone for the past 18 months that that area of space has become much healthier for content since jump fatigue came into effect we used to have a major capital supremacy group stage within the warzone who could and would project those capitals across the length and breadth of new eden with ease when they were bored they would drop capitals on anything in the warzone larger than a destroyer fleet if they couldjump fatigue made them have to choose where to base much more carefully and the health of the region has blossomed since they had to relocate where once there was one 1 invincible superpower there are now several groups ranging from small to large that have started to fill the void creating a more dynamic and varied environment capital ships are still used however mostly by local powers who have an investment in the politics of the region rather than oh look a hel is undocked and 20 nyxs are teleported from the other side of the map in a matter of minutesif the effects of jump fatigue are watered down i worry that these regional players will be more likely to get squashed by returning super powers looking to regain peripheral holdings if their main fleets can afford to reach the area again from wherever they are currently deployedmy opinion only not looking to start an argument here at least
i forgot you were gathering questions i have onewhat are ccp  the csms thoughts on refining the phoebe travel restrictions with a view to changing the restrictive mechanism from a flat timer to a gameplay or chancebased mechanismeg jump a carrier while your jump timer is still active being possible but having a chance which increases with the level of the timer of landing you elsewhere in the grid the system or just in the whole mapeg when a capital ship is cyno jumped instead of just boosh you appear you have to navigate your ship through a warp tunnel to the destination  the further away the destination the longer you have to spend in the tunnel the higher your fatigue the more twisty and obstaclestrewn the path is clipping the edge of the tunnel might damage your hull offline modules or land you in an expected destinationsince many of the objections i see to the travel changes are complaints about weaponised boredom c from restrictive timers that cant be mitigated or altered then changing the mechanism to one that allows the pilot to take a risk andor affect the outcome with piloting skill with unexpected outcomes offering unpredictable gameplay scenarios might allieviate these complaints
q with the new sov system would it be possible to have no fatigue using jump bridges in alliance spacealso to avoid exploits make it so your sov is based on the constellation and not an individual systemso there cant be random systems across the coalitions to make traveling outside the region you live in easierq would it be possible to have jump range restored to previous values and 10 min cool down on jump reactivation flat rate and not ship specific no stackingq would it be possible to have 5ly range with a 5 min reactivation timer not ship specificq what did happen to ccp grayscale
unexpected i think you meanalso enough with the minigame ideas please
my question issince the phoebe changes went live lowsec has become a far more diverse and interesting environment in which to live will ccp take these positive changes to lowsec into account when considering further changes to jump fatigue and jump range
as always i speak for myself not the csm as a whole i think the jump changes did what they set out to do do i think all the numbers are perfect no there is always room for refinement and dial turning to tweak it here and therea complete shift in the mechanics is also worth looking at but not one that results in nerf everyone except us sadly some of the questions are leading to that i am not sure what you mean by a gameplay mechanic chance ooooh so much room in that word do you mean a chance of the person missing the destination even by systems or a constellation fatigue replaced by accuracy which diminishes unless you allow systems and pilot to realign or do you mean a chance of huge fatigue or none at allas sugar said above we are collecting and collating the questions this weekend if you have some the end is nearmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
they better p
im sure plenty of people are going to beg for the removal or heavy nerf of the jump fatigue mechanic thatll just take us back to the problems of force projection so im going to be bold and suggest it needs to go in the other directionwould ccp consider implementing one of mannys earlier suggestions for jump drives by reducing jump range to 1 system away and removing fatigue altogetherobviously warp speed would need increasing etc but imho jump drives create so many issues in eve theyre better off being removed
if i personally had to make a suggestion on the matter i would suggest that ccp after announcing well beforehand delete any and all blueprints for them no more new ones the existing ones will be the last
thats actually not a terrible suggestionit would give us all even more reason to cheer those blessed lowsec russians that are killing supers left and right
first of all  i think jumpfatigue was a great idea all in all it worked ok with some problems to be solved but it achieved the main goal of reducing the forceprojection of big powerblocksbut i would like to know some details1 what are your future plans to jump and titanbridges should they be similar to each other or fulfill different rolesobjectives2 fatigue reduced the forceprojection of capitals a lot do you plan to introduce a counterpart to capblobs because aggressors cant move their own cap fleet that easy remember that caps are quite common within the memberbase atm and if you are not able to react to an enemy cap fleet could decide a war3 do you plan to tweak the jumprange of jumpfreighter and if yes do you think local industries will be able to catch up 4 after the introduction of jumpfatigue some players call caps useless others still blame them op what are your opinion about this  do you think caps are in place or a rebalance maybe even a redesig is needed 5 do you think about relocation of some regions to each other so that you can jump across their borders this could remove some bottlenecks where caps musst pass through to enter a region via gate 6 what are your future plans for supercarriers and titans in eve should they become a more strategic weapon or be in line with the actual mass of scaps and the wish of their owners to use them in combat ps its late in germany so please be patient with my bad english
just one questionjump fatigue are going to disapear and jump range are going back to what it was before phoebe for capitals
my question isfor almost all mechanics a newbe can do a low power version of what a veteran can do i think jump drives are fundamentally bad for the game because at some point in your skill training you get a new and incredible power which a newbe is totally unable to use this adds to the feeling only veterans can play eve and theres no room for new players do you agree with me that in principle all mechanics should be available to all players right from day onethanks
are jump freighters and other industrial ships still going to lose their fatigue bonus or get it reduced and are jump freighters still planed to have their range reduced
what im getting at here is that jump fatigue is a classic example of a ccp mechanic in a narow mechanical sense it change the parameters of what can and cant be done but it doesnt add any game got a timer no jumping for you the end timers up ok you can jump now as an eve health and safety regulation its nicely constructed as a gameplay mechanism its a to do marker
do you even think about the players who have spent years hundrets of dollars and what ever in the game to get to a certain point  where they can use advanced mechanics and you want all the good stuff available for the beginning that is not the way eve works if you do not want to wait  buy a char the castration ccp brought with jump fatigue was basicly a big punch directly in the face of the veteran players as is started playing eve my big goal was owning a super or a titan there was nothing more i wanted to do than throw that thing into a big capital fight as i reached my goal guess whatjump fatigue and the castration of jump range is not the way to go at least not as it is right now
i will be able to stream this if no one else is already doing it
what are your thoughts on having a timer be per ship and not per character this would limit force projection but not prevent the player from changing ships and continuing to play the gameother ideasresource cost per jump which increases if jumps are done quickly after each other but doesnt prevent you from jumping perhaps ozone or some other resourcemuch shorter timers
dont touch anything while it working
is that fatigue reduction bonus on jump freighters going to get removedat the time they said not having it would kill nullsec or something i look forward to hauling actually being a real part of the game rather than just invincible teleport ships who never have to leave the dock radius of a station
do you have any plans to address the death of solo nomadic game play it used to be quite simple to take a carrier load up a few ships and move across the universe for new content now that capability has been removed and a similar trip takes days are there any plans to adjust the loss of blops quick attack capabilities the idea of blops should be ninja attacks in and out strike fast eat cap boosters while you kill your target and get out having fatigue after that first jump means finding a safe and sitting and waiting in hostile territory for up to 5 minutes this seems counterintuitive to the nature of blops have you considered having jump fatigue kick in after every second jump or further reducing the jump fatigue reduction to say jf levelsmany people play eve for capital ships it was the reason that i started playing eve do you think a 30 day timer is a little excessive wouldnt capping fatigue at 12 24 or even 48 hours be just as sufficient at 24 hours you still have a 32minute cooldown this seems sufficient to prevent force projection while still allowing those of us that love capital ships to use them regularly does it really make sense to have a game that limits a persons play time to once every 8 or 30 days it seems like thats a lot less content for other people with players simply logging off to play other games to wait out timers
eve was nerfed pretty hard in order to improve new player experience veterans said wtf and canceled subscriptions new players said thank you this game doesnt fit me and left the faster they try through all of the possible mechanics the more chance they quit before realizing what eve is really aboutand btw new players can jump right from day one in a rookie shipfixed that for youthat riskaverse behavior of you and the likes of your is the reason we all got that fatigue
you can use gatesallowing capitals through the gates was a huge mistake imo but they did it for the sake of the game so you should be thankfulallowing the gates turned cynojammers from strategic assets into carebears sentinels with cynojammers dominion sov could still work with a couple of tweaks without them we were doomed to have fozziesov where capitals are useless and this nerfcascade was triggered so that you can have that game
and i do have a question for ccpis my rorqual really that fearsome that you keep it tamed to 5 ly 
id just like to point out a general trend here from what ive been reading theres a significant trend of we dont know what ccp wants or intends with these changes from the comments hereobviously ccp has intentions could they perhaps publish them to help us understand what theyre aiming for with no defined objectives you cannot measure successas for malcanis point a you can jump anyway ability unless the downsides were so terrible would just remove the phoebe changes for the larger groups whilst keeping them for the smaller groups phoebe for all its apparent problems applies equally changing this without a very good reason isnt sensible
if only there were some way for a few guys in cheap subcaps to slow the hell out of capital gate travel
ok 8 pages and some good questions and fuel for the roundtablei am drawing a line here and things after this may or may not be attended to watch for the soundcloud the link will be posted in this thread and perhaps even a twitch stream not my callnow we sort the questions into general categories and try to find the appropriate alcohol to get the dev to talkthanks again guys you kept this civil and fairly easy to work throughmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

for all those people complaining about jump fatigueconsider this
when ccp decided to alter the jump range of capitals and also introduced the fatigue mechanic the primary purpose was to limit force projection and traveling vast distances in a short amount of time now with the new mechanics this has turned the game into a game of logistics a game of waitingthe virtual effect of this was to make new eden larger again in terms of travel time and hardshipquestions1 have ccp considered that expanding the universe itself by a factor as well as a reduced fatigue mechanic could have bought the desired effect the game was looking for2 can ccp show us what the effect the jump range reduction and fatigue mechanics have had ona travelmigration patternsb universal market activity highsec vs nullsec before and after the changesc player activity after enuring fatigue eg they played in sub caps logged off to wait out timers etc3 are there any plans to remove jump fatigue for jump bridges4 since before and after capital travel changes can we have some stats on capital usage and how the player base has reacted in terms of the use of capitals secondly is what the data shows the effect ccp anticipated 5 the fact that this discussion is taking place would indicate that all is not well with the community and this set of game mechanics when they were employed into the game was there a backup plan if it didnt work out or was it full steam ahead and hope for the best approachwhilst in principle i appreciate what the mechanics were trying to do limit large scale quick capital movement and in essence that was achieve but it has come at a cost to the playability of the game personal viewpossible options to discuss to reduce the pain 1 skill to reduce jump fatigue2 remove jump fatigue on jump bridges3 jump fatigue is dependent on ship mass therefore larger capitals are penalised more than smaller capitals4 implants to reduce jump fatiguethanks in advance
1 are there any plans for removing jump fatigue 2 if jump fatigue is not removed will there be a skill that reduces jump fatigue significantly enough to make capitals viable again and less frustrating to move3 do you think its a good things that players have decided its easier to self destruct capitals than move them4 can we also have statics on how many capitals have been self destructed since phoebeat the end of the day eve is a game not a job its supposed to be fun imo jump fatigue needs to be removed or significantly nerfed in order to make eve more enjoyable it shouldnt be easier to self destruct capitals instead of moving them
excellent point space needs to be more localized like this the only thing i would like to see about jump fatigue change is its effect on blops bs and bridges jump bridges and maybe jump freighters jf fatigue isnt so bad tbh

plex for wisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
one form of wis i could get behind would be something similar to what theyve done with valkyrie and gunjack make sure as many of the assets as possible can also be used in other projects with minimal alterationsas a couple of examples how about station interiors that can also be used as buildingbase interiors for dust 514 or being able to take shots of your customised captains quarters and use them as the background for your character portrait i think it would help get over the dislike most people have for the idea of any development work being done purely for wis
so the week as passed and what its gonna beare there any lights on the horizontguess its better to me to unsub2 days left for me
you can contract your stuff to me and ill make sure its put to good use blowing stuff up and being blown up
blow your own stuff guess its the right wayyou want stuff and isks there are 2 ways for that1  work as i do2  buy plexes and sell themits very easy
im in no need for more stuff im just sad thinking about your stuff not ever getting used properly
guess you are needing otherwise you didnt ask me for it
not need  i want you stuff to blow it up if you dont give it to anybody could you please blow it all up and send screenshots of the explosions thatd be just as good as giving it all away and way better than having it sit in a station belonging to an unsubbed character anyway to keep this on topic heres a reiteration of some changes i think would benefit everybody an activated entosis link selfdestructs if it is turned off without having successfully captured a node reinforced a sov structure or disablesenable a station service this allows interceptors to continue to be viable ships for an actual sov attack and continue to be viable trolls for empty systems but makes each run away sovtroll cost the troller at least 30 million isk and requires them to refit somewhere if they want to continue a slow passive defense if a particular nodestructure isnt under active attack this would allow defenders to hold sov against trolls without having to entose multiple command nodes yet wouldnt be any barrier to an actual attacker say over two to four days the defender wins nodes by default depending on adm
what next1 mil  2 mil  5 mil  10 mil and 50mil skill point packages
generally its been a no in fact ccp initially intended for everyone to get 2 remaps per year every 6 months but the community asked for a reductioni have a feeling attributes are going at some point in the future they do not help new players and hinder specialisationthey should be kept but to influence another game mechanic and not training speeddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
well apparently ccp thinks that whUFFFDs are not designed for players living there otherwise wormholers havenUFFFDt abandoned their whUFFFDs and many of them unsub their accountswh is not claimable and ccp are not going to change that however ccp can change some things in there if they wanti lived in one recently and its not profitable always getting 0 anomalies and tons of whUFFFDsanomalys spawn random in the constelation and if you are in one that have low or very low activity on constellation then getting anomalies are going to be a pain in the assactive whUFFFDs should get rewarded for their activity and not penalized the more activity they have more anomalies should spawn randomlyabout clockers yes something must be done to prevent the afk cloacking one ship or one structure that will declock the afk cloakers after a giving time half an hour 1 hourin wh you have to always use your dscan and if you can control all the exits that way you are not going to get caught easily
take sov in know space where you have an ice belt put your tcu up  build a station  install wormhole generation upgrade  and from your system visit wormholes every day wait wormhole upgrade is not working nvm then
destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
can or will exceptions be made to jump fatigue as part of the outcomes from this discussioni would like to see it removed from all subcap ships to allow player movement while still limiting capital projection as it was intended right now to make any kind of movement we have to plan our game sessions hours in advance or log out and play world of warships for a while until the timer runs out allowing subcap movement might increase participation in the current sov mechanics toohaving a mechanic that prevents me playing eve makes me think you do not want me playing eve
i think jump fatigue should be based on the size of the ship and the distance being jumpedlimiting jump bridge networks has just slowed down contentbridging does not equal jumping for black ops or titansif you want to fix things then have small ships dock in carriers and carriers jump carriers and super carriers should be able to jump sub capsi dont care for the 5 au distance limitation but as a game id think that big ships should jump further than small ships and their fatigue should be greater regardless so a super carrier is big its jump range is far its cool down takes a long timea carrier is medium its jump range isnt as far and its cool down takes timea black ops is small its jump range is extensive along the line of a jump freighter and its cool down is about the same as a jfi think titans should be able to jump not bridge across the map titans arent the sov problem supers were if a titan jumps 100 light years and suffers 24 hours of jump fatigue that seems reasonable simon
there is zero difference between bridging and jump bridgessame range and same exact case for power projection
nonsense bridging can be done from within your space into enemy space jump bridges require the same power to hold both ends this is not power projection its domestic traveledit to add what made jump bridges seem like such tools for power projection was the sheer sprawling size of empires  nas rental space dominated the east side of the map the way the combined allianes of the cfc dominated the west side so yes people could use what amounted to the equivalent of continentspanning highway systems to put the pedal down and cross vast distances but those jump bridge networks relied on sprawling empires that cant exist anymore you cant hold the space if you dont have the population density and if theres an entity with enough people to maintain that population density across 50 of the conquerable systems in eve game over man game over 5 meters thats inside the room
has ccp considered making some changes to the eve map to mitigate the effects of the phoebe changes possible changes could includeshorter spans between certain regionsmore npc 00 space innear certain regions
1have ccp considered to make capital ships more different to partially solve current lack of mobility why each race cannot have different jump range  and different fatigue generationwhat will this change this  if people are using archons or chimerasfor example why minmatar carrier cannot have 50 increased jump range  and higher fatigue generation  while gallente carrier even bit shorter range  but 50 or more fatigue reduction each carrier for specific task why all capitals have to be the samethis way specific carrier can fill specific role2 orwhy we cannot change way we are jumping a current range jump directly to cyno b 25 range jump to system where cyno is located  50  chance for warp drive malfunction for 3minutes  unable to cloak because of the effectc 75 range jump to constellation where cyno is located  75  chance for warp drive malfunction for 3minutes  unable to cloak because of the effectincreased jump range at grater risk and cost i hope for more smuggler gates  as this gate connections can solve most of the current mobility issues provide choke points  they can be easily made non abusable by placing exit gates in stationless npc systems simple example from my own yard connecting 2 smuggler gate connections can bring few regions back to life when you connect paragon soul and stain  and then in the same system create connection to lowsec system you are solving tons of issues that phoebe created for far regions o4tz5  lc1edtirbamnpc systems without stations esoteriaparagon soul period basis are more exposed to new groups contesting space stain is more open for groups wanting to live in npc space lets move bit more and create one more gate connection 3ly9m  lc1edwe are adding the same to tenerifis  impass omist and feythabolis3 smugglers gates that totally change way you live  and can access in 8 regions the same approach can be used for other areas of null space
i might be willing to concede to your idea on one condition it only applies to your alliance jump bridgesjump bridges work by standings so going from deklein to vale in a matter of a few minutes then bridging to geminate is a bit too much power projection compared to what others have at their disposal considering only a small portion of that is actual goon controlled space
i totally agree in this jump bridges need to change this can be done in multiple ways  another possibility jump bridges dont give you blue timer  but using jump bridge give you 5 minute red timerlimiting them to one organization have its downsides  as many groups are split to 2 sub alliances first keeps all mains  and pvp characters 2nd where you keep your alts  cynos  jf pve chars  academy or friends so the question is will ccp consider changing jump bridge mechanic that they dont provide any fatigue blue timer  but instead of it generate only reactivation timer5 minute red timer for jumps within same region  and 15 minutes of red timer for jump bridges between regions to block abuse in power projection
would it be possible to tie the capital system mechanic 1 per alliance to fatigue aka no fatigue when bridgingjumping to or from the capital system or perhaps within 10ly of the capital system
nor is any fleet doing that likely to be a 100 or even 50 goon fleet so what youre really complaining about isnt jump bridges its politics
the other main difference with jump bridges is they are known fixed points and because you can only have one in system you cannot chainjump without passing through gates between jump systems i would argue the cloud ring and fountain residents got more kills out of camping the couple of main jumpbridge links than by doing so anywhere else if i am in a particular system with a jump bridge and a titan i can only use the jump bridge to go to the one specific destination system the titan can drop me in any system in a 5ly circle currently the only pro for having a jump bridge is not needing someone to log on a titan alt whereas titan bridges are flexible in destination not limited by sov control less predictable and faster to set up you can jump a titan then get him to bridge your ships far faster than you can erect a pos and jump bridge giving a little pro or two to the bridge for local movement again i fully agree the multiregion superhighways were bad doesnt seem unfair or unbalanced
it is working but it could still be working betterthe its not broke dont fix it is not a mantra you should follow
im not sure how easy this would be to do since they could not tie the jump timer to ships using cov ops portals and just had to tie it to all the ships that could use themchanging fatigue based on what was being used to jump doesnt seem to be something ccp can do with ease as well the jump timer is tied to the fatigue timer and ignores the range you are jumping it is only the fatigue timer that takes jumping into account so if ccp can do this then o and please remove the fatigue bonuse from cov opsrecon and put it onto the cov ops bridge
nope that is a fleet traveling long distances with no drawback which is power projection pure and simple by your same token jumping to beacons should accrue any fatty gay either then
malcanis i have come to expect better out of youits impossible to fully separate and parse out the strength of the individual effects of fozziesov vs phoebe each individual effect plus their interaction best explains the current map and the change from the old one rather than one effect on its own jump fatigue alone does not explain the massive shift in the map which you do asserteditperhaps not intentional but its also odd that one of the selected maps shows coalitions and one shows alliances it would be more fair to show coalitions on both of which the change is there but less drastic
a lot of people for and against any changes to the jump rangefatigueso many pros and cons to it depending on were you live in eveand main objections to changing it is due to power projectionso would it not be a better method of dealing with the power houses and not taking it out on the ships or the ships abilitieswould removal of standings helpdisband the power houses and lets get some killing in on all sides allow only one blue and one red the rest of the universe is nuetral long live nbsifurther more as it was just pointed out to me to stop them forming mass alliances cap amounts allowed in corps and alliances to a max of 5000
noplease continue to suck it especially in light of the unprovoked wh nerf thank you and eabod
am i correct in thinking that there was an activity report of some sort that was used as evidence for inactivity
yes there was the inevitable spreadsheet showing attendance at meetings
thank you maybe i will post that in the petition to the gm lol
topic moved to fandi
let me stop you there if you dont know who the current csms are or have any idea what they represent then how do you know that the interests of new players are not already being represented you are taking anecdotal evidence that you have overheard in your short time in eve and assuming it is factyou just keep digging yourself deeper dont you if you cant even be bothered to continue digging to figure out what the csms represent then how can any player of the game trust you to dig and figure out what would actually improve the new player experienceyou keep mentioning that you want change but havent said anything about what sort of change you will actually try to bringi get it youve said its early in the campaign and you havent built a platform yet fine id like to assert that you actually start planning something because if you continue making posts like the ones in this thread nobody is going to take you seriously thats just the way it isid also like to say that in my opinion you seem like you are just not ready for a position like this you find out about csm and then the next day consider yourself to be what the game needs to improve i think that is wildly arrogant especially considering you continuously assert that new players have no representation without actually doing any research so that you can give us evidence of this im going to tell you now that there are current and past csm members that certainly have new players in their hearts all of the csms ideas to improve new player experiences are not necessarily implemented by ccp remember csm acts as an advising group to ccp not a controlling body for the direction of the game im going to use a little bit of eve terminology below that you will most certainly hear in your time playing eve if you stick around you are not a special snowflake you are not the first extremely young gameage and uninformed player to run for csm and you wont be the last just because you are a new player doesnt mean you know what is best for the new players to be able to propose solutions to problems you need a deep understanding of the problems that exist and also knowledge of the history of solutions that have been tried youve already proven that you arent willing to put in this work with the posts that i quoted new players dont necessarily need a new player to represent them they need a player thats wellinformed of the problems that new players face but also has a deep understanding of the mechanics in this game to be able to provide any sort of useful solutionim sorry if you found this post difficult to read or discouraging im not saying you shouldnt run but you need to put in more effort than youve demonstrated in this thread and i personally think you need a bit more time to mature as a player
i started playing eve online with the hope of engaging in these huge fleet battles now every time im trying to interest myself in this i just get a sweet offer of entosis lookoutthe whole fozziesov thing is garbage the huge power blocs are crumbling and dozens of new alliances are popping up everywhere and dont get me started on the entosis link that is a trolls ultimate tool
wasnt that exactly what fozziesov was hoping to achieve
yeah except all of the crumbling happened before aegis what we have now is blocs that are even more firmly entrenched because no one in null with the ability to actually unseat them cares to mess with this godawful new system what we do have though is plenty of runawaaaaaay trollololol made you undockthe only ones actually losing any space were those who were highly overextended and theyre just not even bothering to contest sovlasering on their unused space
well guess its not working as intended new alliances rise and fallthis is not about pvp what we see in eve long time ago are only ganking and ganking is not pvp pvpeers use to say that they do pvp but what they do its just ganking 10 vs 60 or more that is not pvp however there are some players who like to do the real pvp thats why new sov mechanics are not working properly new alliances can conquer systems but cant hold them they are going to be hotdropped until they leave so small entities its just a mirage
i know i missed the cutoff but here goesmajor problems with phoebe1 effectively removed what many players view as end game material causing many to unsub2 made eve a bigger place by reducing the ability to travel due to less players playing this is a force multiplier for stagnationmajor problems with eve as a whole1 new players so far behind an aging playerbase skillpoints being the biggest and hardest thing to overcome core skills are the biggest problem with getting newer players to play the game and stick with it theres well over a years worth of training for core skills i define core skills as anything you train that has a passive effect not on a specific item its a long list of skills and a lot of skillpoints for my characters i wouldnt care if i got a refund on them but for lower sp characters they probably would it is such a massive amount of skillpoints to refund that it should be done  12mil sp refunded per month and the skill then being a permanent passive or rolled into the base stats of everything it effected this is to prevent the majority of the playerbase from having 20 million unallocated skillpoints2 fozziesov turned sov warfare into a war of attrition to maintain your sov by opening up the ability for completely uninterested parties to troll sov owners not only is the concept of the entosis link terrible the multinode system is bad this is because it promotes small fights with annoying ships not real combat battleships and above have basically been made useless by this i really dont have a solution for this other than come to some sort of middle ground between dominion sov and fozziesov bring back sbus and structure grinding but keep the indexes and have them modify the hitpointsresists of structures and the sbu online timejudging by
i missed the cutoff but this wasnt very well publicised so if you can include these questions that would be greatonce the capital rebalance is done assuming jump fatigue stays in its current format would they consider sp reimbursement for selected capital only skills for those that wanted them this is due to the fact that when people initially invested in both supercapitals and their supercapital alt the game was significantly different to what it is todayif jump fatigue was originally introduced to prevent fast and massive escalation of capital fights and this has been achieved would ccp consider toning down fatique or extending jump range so the tedium of just moving a capital around is lessened pheobe didnt prevent capital deployment for long term war it didnt prevent capital use as taxis it just made it very very tedious it went from 20 minutes to get across eve if youre well oiled to about 4 days by jumping onlywould ccp consider adding back two jump bridges per system if fatigue remains the same as it is now the fatigue itself would act as a deterrent for overuse pheobe then fozzie sov drastically changed the nature of fleet warfare limiting fleets to not only in class but to very specific hulls your stats may say otherwise but in game youll notice this clearly would you consider rebalancing classes of ships to more diversify fleet combat or is a the predominately risk adverse kiting doctrines we see right now and since pheobe went live something ccp actually wants armoured close range ships and close range combat in general seems to have been killed with pheobe
holy autocorrect batman and theres a case to be made of exactly that that fleets jumping to beacons arent projecting power theyre moving around in areas you already hold in fact theres more of a case there because my carrier cant jump to an allys beacon no matter what their standings are rather like entosising it just doesnt workdont get me wrong im not saying that jump bridges etc dont make it a lot easier to hold a coalition together  but at this point i think it should be pretty clear theyre not the defining tool for power projection that greyscale seemed to think they were and his own statements indicated that you were supposed to be able to move around your own spaceso why not adm em reduce fatigue for using a jb or jump drive but not a titan bridge based on friendly adm if were supposed to be able to move around our own space let us move around our own space
i hope jump ranges revert back to the old values some day with no jump fatigue because new fozzie sov doesnt favor any capital ships as capital ships play absolutely no role in taking sov anymoreanyone with noob ship can take any system he wants no matter how many capital ships defender brings
all capital ships would literally reduce your chances of defending to zero vs small none hitable ships1next they will be further reducing ship loss for anything sub capital this will allow them to reduce capital ships in game by attrition as people will prefer flying ships they cannot lose nullsec was an excellent use case test for this customer behavior2then they will make capital ship blueprints hard to research and buy further reducing capitals in game3its important that we dont panic ccp has great plans for capitals ships
you have discovered ccps plansthat is great news now that its a matter of public information they will have no choice but to return back to papulas suggestion original jump ranges and capital ship usability capital ships matter 
i dont know if you know but5x penalty to entosis link cycle timefor all capitals that gives you enough time to jump in your capitals with 15 au range and kill themand try to hit a ceptor with moros if you can
i would love to see the fit that lets a moros hit a ceptornot possible after the nerfs
of course its not possible that makes dreads obsolete if you wanna kill a ceptor entosisinUFFFD
idea for creating more activity in nullsec tie jump fatigue to the hull increase industry increase isk drain increase market activity increase haulingnullsec will be booming with a new economy to compensate for jump fatigue people cannot afford to buy alts on the char bazaar to compensate for pilot jump fatigue many also cannot afford to sub alternate accounts buying new ships once in awhile is far more realisticidea for increasing fights in nullsecreduce alliances via unrealistic isk fee 10 billion a month maybe remove alliances and coalitions entirelyidea for reducing capital ship usage continue on the same road reduce our abilities to use capitals ships you are only 1 step away from completely removing themidea for fixing carriers without completely removing them let ships dock inside carriers allow carriers to jump with a 15 man fleet from point a to point b and absorb all the jump fatigue or even better be immune to jump fatigue they are called carriers after all
 this i often wondered why they punish players who spent a great deal of isk and over a year of skill training add up the isk and time spent with those skills then put in a pile and burn it i think a great deal of capital pilots felt the punishment nerf was a little severe yes there was a problem with power projection not enough of it would any military industry nerf their weaponsships odd how the game logic is not following rl experiences in a real sandbox the ships that do not preform as well as others would be upgraded as well not nerfed

personally i think the idea of entosing the pos in first place to gain access to computer then hack it to unanchorof course iUFFFDm talking about those posUFFFDs who are just anchored for more then 30 days without being onlineposUFFFDs should be like the containers in space if you dont open them in a giving time they blow up posUFFFDs should be the same but instead of being removed by time they should be removed by playersthat way players who have left their posUFFFDs everywhere are going to be more carefull not leaving their assets in space for so longin hs there are tons of dead posUFFFDs just beacause people are not use them due the not appealing industry indexes and the prices they have to pay for use their own structures its just not fair and accpetable for players paying for the structures and then pay for research or build whatever they want on npc stations thats fine but not on posUFFFDs however leaving their posUFFFDs in space should have consequencesi know in hs we can always wardec them just for blowing the pos however i think retrieving those posUFFFDs is the best way that makes people get involved and profit at the same timefor that ccp could create a timer that every player can see when he reach near the pos when that timer is out pos can be entosed and then hacked if the hack fails the pos must be entosed again
that is a good suggestion in conjunction with the new sov changesthough i would still suggest that once the last of any racial type is destroyed it would return to the game as a unique item as i had suggestedit may take 10 years to get anywhere near that point but it could be a good first step
my idea to fix sov trolling is twofold1 move the notification to the sov holder to earlier in the cycle half way through the beginning whatever2 increase the cycle time for the initial assault if youre going to attack someone in a trollceptor theyll have notice and youll be a sitting duck for longer problem solved
nah the defenders should just have pilots in their system if the system doesnt have pilots in it during its vulnerability the defenders deserve to lose their system eli who is happy to hear so many entities upset they cant defend their systems in absentia and further is happy to hear so many entities find being ongrid with a hostile interceptor boring as they are better suited for living in highsec where they dont have to worry about such things and can go back to their carebearing ways without worry albeit at reduced income levels not like i am interested in claiming sov for myself but for the health of the game in general i believe its necessary for those people to be booted out of their current sov playstyles as i told lucas  i hope their empires crumble to the ground around themps  oh and regarding supers if drifter battleships are adjusted so as to rove around sovnull and use entosis links against sov structures thatd certainly make supers more necessary as even carriers can have difficulty tanking them
also known as the death of eve
a no from me
for those wanting to listen in to the townhall today you can keep track by listening on twitch at
recommending subcaps should have been upgraded with jump drives d in honesty though i do agree with you its fatigue nurf was a bit harsh maybe a hard cap of 7 days instead of 30 i do however very much like the fact that the fatigue mechanic has caused the collapse of and contraction of most of the pre existing nullblocs yes it has had its intended effect i am ok with that now how do we make jump bridges worth having without going back to having 250 archon blobs moving all across the map in 15mins
can we get a link where we can watch later schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
usually the sounding board is recorded on ts then hosted on soundcloud or a direct download serviceif its being streamed on twitch hopefully that means the stream will be saved and we can just reference that
i unfortunately missed this but i sure hope we address a few things a lot of people seem to want to tackle all the problems now but until some missing pieces are implemented it is difficult to know for sure how it is best to addressthis new system granted it needs adjustment insert interesting content here is forcing entities to live in a smaller footprint that is fine in principle that said from a transportation standpoint jump bridges usage went from crazy high to probably 510 of what it was i am being generous i would heavily reduce fatigue similar to a jf or remove it entirely if a large entity owns 1 constellation who cares if that jb network makes it easy to travel in it its a substantial quality of life improvement for resident while having little to no impact on force projectionfor capitals i would either look at reduced fatigue say 20 less or same fatigue with increased range say 2ly something not too drastic so ccp can evaluate the impact and adjust if needed they keep flashing that increased iteration speed as an advantage capitalsforce projection is important enough to try and find a better situation without reverting back completely or maintaining current status quoonce capitals are rebalanced and we have the structures then we can have a good idea of what additional changes could be needed
hello baki yuku of black legion rental overlord and fc thereof i have a question for ccp regarding the jumpchanges where ccp repeatedly stated moving should not be easy which just seems a bit silly to me because ccpUFFFDs version of UFFFDdifficultUFFFD seems to be more time consuming and tedious instead of actual difficulty in any meaning full way why is it that a game should be UFFFDdifficultUFFFD which in ccp words means time consuming to the point where it feels like having a second job should game not first and foremost be about fun spending 610 hours on a move op is not fun being more or less forced to destroy or entire dreadnought fleet in venal and having to rebuild them in lowsec because it is economically sound and for the sake of our memberUFFFDs sanity to do so is not fun either you might say well you had the choice between moving them or insuring them and blowing them up to rebuild them in lowsec but it really was not a choice it was a UFFFDforcedUFFFD choice so to speak it allowed us to preserve the sanity of our members at the expanse of my own
as i see it as i listen to the round table home field advantage should have massive reduced jump fatigue when using jb no matter the ship the lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs
174746 eve system  xenuria was muted by corbexxeffective until 20150812 1817reason shoesi didnt even ask about shoes clearly the csm needs reform to prevent this sort of abuse and over zealous moderation my voice matters just as much as anybody elses i didnt even ask about shoes i didnt ask about anything i pointed out that the stream was down reform the csm
if theres still a possibility to ask a questionis it possible to generate jumpfatigue only when doing a regional jump eg from metropolis  the forge but jumpes within the same region do not generate fatigue or it gets a bonus of eg 50 less fatiguein my opinion that would still make it hard to move across multiple regions but makes it possible to move faster within the same region and therefore make it easier to generate local 3 regions according to ccp larrikin content
instead of thinking its a game mechanic issue why dont you think about restricting the amount of api data available or data full stop its crazy that you can go on the map for instance and see every cyno lit in the entire universe or see all pod kills or see npc kills in reality you would never know this information just keep api data to pure stats not player stats its silly that all this info is available there is far too much intel available
well it seems that ccp havent answered any question in particular and limit their answers to evasive manouversthe point is not only the the jump fatigue for itself but the limited ly that capitals can jumpi can understand their concerns however something should be done regardind for those who only wish to move assets to or from null seclow sechigh sec and that part as not been looked as it shouldmobility from and to null sec are needed in order to people can move their things if there is no mobility and the risk are too high of course nobody will move anything and null sec will be empty in a short matter of time  it is now in factnull sec markets never worked as intended but theres one part of null where null sec market works but that comes with a cost where only a few have become richtrilionaires and the others must do what they are toldone of the problems are most of the people dont care about pvp i can understand them and i can undurstand those who really want to make pvp but the reallity in eve is other everytime some group tries to make some pvp they are literally ganked by hotdrops and that is not pvp that way are demotivating for who are trying to start on pvp as they always ends on the same way no matter what they do its high skilled and trained pvpeers in a large superior numbers against no trained at all new pvpeerssmall entities as ccp call the small alliances are not going to be able to estabilish in null sec at least for medium or long periods due the anterior and that new sov mechanichs ccp are convicted that unused systems are the main problem or the renter alliances but thats not true and they know that systems are not in use just because they are not providing anything usefull to players as they have done 4 or 5 year ago where all systems are equal and the upgrades will upgrade only that system giving the real benefit to who work on that systemfour years ago almost everybody as what are looking for pvpeers miners explorers industrialists traders etc now almost anyone are getting what are looking for and that is very bad for the gameccp have created and feeded the monster now they havent any clue on how to dominate that monster and the worst part of this story is that said monster have dominated ccp
thank you downloading nowmikes soundcloud isnt working for me
thank you mike 
i am severely disappointed by this townhall thing to me it looked like a very feeble attempt at damage control and yet some people were still not able to put their ego second for once what i got out of this was eve is fine l2p noobs from a fellow player i can take that from a dev however i dont want to hear this
thanks for uploading mike next time please disable the teamspeak sound notifications when recording
i didnt want to be automatically negative about this but it wasnt really a round table more question and then defensive answering by ccp without using any specifics unless theyre willing to concede points and actually discuss the topics rather than brush off questions with some very canned responses ie we might take a look in the future or just being plain defensive then there is little point to ideas like this regardless of the best intentions of the people who set it up
already existsits called nullsec
go back to warcraftplenty of pve only there
new broUFFFDs for whathotdrop them until they bleedgank them until they leavethats what can expect from the old broUFFFDs
i dont disagree that you shouldnt be able to keep your space if you arent using it but if you set your vulnerability to your prime time then your solution is to what always leave some people behind to defend your system if you want to go on roams make sure you have alts that can be logged in and defend against a lone interceptor
out of curiousity how would it have been better set up thenplease remember that ccp does not plan on announcing new things at informal q and a sessions but would you decide to select a small crew of players excluding the larger population as not being worthy of having the floor exclude anybody who has not fcd who or maybe it would have been better if we moderated more sternly    wander off topic shachchack boom on to the next personmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
it wouldve been better had ccp come ready to defend and discuss their positions instead of the canned response they made some rather belligerent remarks during the recourse of the roundtable that shows a severe bias in their thought process regarding development ccp fozzie has zero null sec experience as we are all awarehis lack of experience is incredibly evident in the way he discusses the topics brought up during the roundtable hes lucky ccp i forgot his name the englishmen was there to save him by being diplomaticlimiting mobility in a game where the largest problem is stagnation and the biggest threat to sov is an interceptor or other frigate with an entosis link get your head out of your arse and solve the real problem
really i dont understand you guys one minute its htfu eve is not easy and secondly oh eve is too hard please make it easy it seems its only when it makes your game hard its a problem when its someone else then they get trolled to htfu for too long large nullsec alliances have had it for too easy even your statement rental overlord states basically as an alliance youre too damn lazy to own your own space and make money from it yourselves you believe that your numbers and caps should get you out of trouble well it shouldnt thats been the issue probably even harder for bl being a jabber ping alliance why dont yo uuse your own space for building why not mine your own minerals to make it more viable no because you simply cant be arsed and thats what ccp has at last decided to say enough is enough one minute people want simulation and then when its suits them arcade mode you want eve to be real but then not imagine you are really in deep space in hostile space do you think it would be easy then people colonise because they are zillions of miles away from space hubs you have to do the same you have to make your home if you cant do that then perhaps you should not be living in nullsecjump fatigue solutioneveryone was crying out for this and the only people whining about it is surprisinig the large null sec alliances with caps that cant move around quickly to hotdrop whoever they want at a moments notice also solo pilots trying to moving caps supers and titans you complain about choke points and being stuck without someone easily knowing your next move well low sec have had this problem for years its called pirate gate camps but for some reason thats ok and people need to figure it out and not be so dumb go figurebut really should you ever be moving a super or titan alone without any support of course not thats a big target saying suicide and you being completely dumbbut i agree its a little too easy for the person finding you what i think might be a good change is that you can change the amount you can jump on a slider which affects the jump fatiqgue factor and of course fuel consumption for example if you want to jump 6ly then the jump fatique would be higher than if you jumped 5ly i think this should be up to a maximum of 15ly so at least you can have more options not succumb so much to choke points but still slows down power projectionfozziesovfor too long alliances have been able to own stupid amounts of space and not even live in it rent it out use the moons and pretty much sit back and rely on supers to be the i win button especially when jump fatigue wasnt around ccp have decided and a great move it is to say hey if you want space then your going to have to actually live in it grow it colonise it and if you cant well you shouldnt have it bravo absolutely the right thing to doits already had a profound affect and especially on those large alliances such as nc bl etc that are just jabber ping alliances that are not active constantly and their members have got to used to playing the cap gamebut its been great for the smaller guys to grab some space and fight over it too so i have to surprisingly give ccp the thumbs up and this one its about timeyes there are things that need to improve on fozziesov its always been ike this in eve things progress and change as the players feedback and use it more alliances like xxdeath who are crying because it affects their rental empire and botting need to get with the program and get in the new world or gtfo im tired of large vet alliances blackmailing ccp you are not the future of eve new players are and i think the penny has finally dropped with ccp even though there is still a lot more work to do around the game to bring more players in and ccp will need to make some big balls decisions like they recently have to do that stopping scamming for example is one however and this maybe controversial i think its time we had a new server instance sorry but i dont agree with the one server philosophy we have alliance been around for years that have taken and kept all the resources in eve for many years and left none for anyone else its not fair on new players or newer players that they will never be able to have control of this this is why many other mmos have multiple instances so that everyone has equal opportunities oh an no one would be able to transfer chars or isk to a new server incase you was wondering
lets look at the reality  if you stick 100 people into a ts channel to discuss something it will turn into a clusterfuck so that isnt a viable proposition for a round table theyll all start talking it will go to  and ts will crashits not really about not being worthy its about picking players who have both experience and the maturity to hold a discussion putting forth both their views and that of the wider community but also ccp being more willing to take part in open discussion and talk about potential concepts and ideas no offence to the csm but this isnt something the csm should be doing for players either  in the csm right now i see only 3 people experienced in capitals endie manfred and shart why just hold one anyway hold as many as it takes to get the views in and thrash out the discussionso how could it be improved i didnt hear one question to the players saying how would you feel if we tried this that is a round table that would be a great start to improving thesethe fear players will misinterpret what they say put out ideas they need to drop the fear of players misinterpreting what theyre saying or jumping to conclusions about that state at the start its a discussion nothing more otherwise there is simply no point to these types of player interactions part of the reason that they get players misinterpreting what they say is the lack of interaction the lack of proper discussion with players all we get is fozzie and rise on their high horses making statements which make little sense to a good deal of players which then get misinterpreted or they just stone wall and say nothing which infuriates people its like theyve been in some kind of pr training bill hicks had some good advice for those types they can defuse the whole supercap thing right now but having a very open discussion a proper round table where they clearly state the ideas discussed are not what were going to do but will be considered if they dont it will just get worse and worse gathering customer  remember were customers  feedback in a constructive and useful manner has well developed methodologies which can be used if ccp wanted to adopt those but it does involve question and answers at some point not 3 canned responses and questions only going one way
it was abit like come join me riding my dead horse 
the absence of new talking points was the problem there has been continuous feedback ever since phoebe posts blogs reddit podcasts so why they thought a specific feedback session now would yield any new fruit is beyond me the mere act of calling for feedback at this late stage is aggravating because it makes people feel they have been ignored up to now they should have made a few announcements which gave an indication of what they are thinking of doing beforehand preferably at a concept level rather than specific figures which people could get bogged down in if they truly wanted feedback they should have done homework  there was plenty of it around
as were speaking of communication problems id like to express my concern hereit often looks like ccp knew for years that there were some specific problem but they could not find any solution for it  and thus just let it rot they have tools like statistics to detect those problems and they are not biased so its not a surprise if ccp and playerbase have different view on which are real issues and which are notbut once ccp detects the problem why dont they come out to forums and say folks we need some help could you give us a brainstorm regarding that thing brainstorming with a group of nonexperts is a valid approach and why they deprive themselves of that option  i have no ideai dont have much to prove myself right and maybe its just an illusion but as an example i remember ccp greyscale wanted to implement unified fuel blocks for poses for quite a while but didnt know how to make a transition i bet if he asked it on forums the solution wouldve been found the same day eve players are very inventive 
the level of moderation was not the problem it really is an issue of the wrong people asking the questions if ccp wants feedback they should be asking us questions you have to realize that holding a session to get feedback for a mechanic change that has literally stopped people from logging into certain accounts is going to be contentious the attitude going in from ccp needed to be immensely more humble and they needed to have far less hubris i think part of the defensive attitude comes directly from devs feeling like they are constantly on the defensive its pretty terrible to have an event where supposedly the devs are looking for feedback where they outright reject questions large parts of the community have had to ponder because they are so out of touch they think the question is unreasonable if this wasnt presented as a question and instead simply as an experience and ccp actually asked follow up questions that could be better but its hard to say because as we heard with the bl dread self destruction example ccp can also have a tendency to just right things off as those crazy kids
ccp killing eve so we all go buy valkyrie remembers promises of world of darknessanother ccp successsuccessfully failedstart listening to your fanbase ccp or your going to end up like your gamesdyingwill not be purchasing any more of ccp products
i actually just thought of a better way to illustrate some of the issues with yesterdays discussionone of the big major face palm moments i remember for the player base was the assertion by the devs that phoebe had little effect on the possibilities of something like br happening again ccp fozzies thesis was that br happened because two large super capital groups were deployed near each other he then cited the ncdarkness vs imperium conflict in fountaindelve earlier this year as an example that two large super groups can still come together and that we were basically a spark away from another brthe problem is he is missing the aspect of the player experience surrounding that fountaindelve deployment the move ops to and back from that region have shaped players views far more than any fighting that did or didnt happen moving down was painful and took more than a week moving back was just as bad and those people who missed the first move op and wound up in the second op on our side were dropped by bl anyone who missed both was now faced with the solo move prospect now argue about the specifics of that all you want but the very act of many of us going through that move put in serious questions as to whether we would ever want to do that again the very thing that fozzie is citing as an example is actually a better example for the players involved as to why phoebe hurts the possibilities of a br style fight now devs cant see the individual experience of players but stepping back and listening to player feedback might help them see a different side of a scenario that they have already formed an opinion on
in the
there is only one boss the customer and he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down simply by spending his money somewhere elsesam waltoni was extremely impressed by how little ccp seemed to appreciated the concerns of the player base yesterday on top of the demeaning remarks made towards the csm i was also surprised by the arrogance presented by a few members of ccp i get it though ccp had the tone of feeling ambushed so instead of providing logical defusing comments they had emotional reactionshopefully ccp will walk away from this experience motivated knowing that the eve player base still cares about the game and wants change to happen for the better if we can take anything from this experience it should be that the players were prepared ccp was notan observation eve has a very high average age and there are quite a few experienced professional amongst the ranks when ccp tries to talk down to their player base they should expect what we are seeing now this is a space sim full of it nerds the players arent stupid
this is wrong about this statement one boss means one person vs the customer in case of eve means maybe about 50k people and no 50k people do not share the same view on this matter i did listen to all of the soundcloud and i could not find any arrogance on behalf of ccp or any dev could you repeat such a statementagain i did not hear any answers of ccp that would imply stupidity of a player
everyone hears things differently i dont expect you to think the same way i do either what i posted was my opinion to ccp therefore validating my opinion to you is useless
in other words zeus cant back his statement up and is trying desperately not to look like a total fool
this thread isnt about me so im trying to keep you all on topic
no large org alliance or corp null sec or low sec that i have ever been in has ever had every single person online and active go on a roamthat normally happened in med sized corps or very small alliances and on rare occasionsim not trying to suggest that that is the rule just seems to be the norm
thanks to new sov capitals and super capitals are not needed to attack and they dont help to defense sovso nothing is limiting power projection now except awful implementation of sov game mechanics its boring time consuming etc when ccp fix the worst issues number of beacons ceptors etc nothing will limit power projection because its not a big deal to deploy non capital ships to any borders and start dropping sov groups like pl may not stay there for long time they could do it for fun for money etc big fail ccp
i think as long as alliances try to hold more sov than they need life will continue to suckthe rules of the game have changed and many dont want to adapt to themmany appear to be trying to do the same ol thing under the new rules and blame everyone except themselves
everyone in eve is a bear who needs to adapt or gtfo unless you happen to be in null sov
does anyone have the statistics that ccp larrikin linked at the end of the discussion
to the discussionccp larrikin started his thread there and the statistics are linked
the in game ship browser tool shares the name of a terrorist group as many players are former and current military i believe this name is inappropriate for in game as a global company you ccp should recognize that many people have fought against and been victims of terrorism throughout the world i currently have friends who may be deployed to combat this terrorist organization please consider changing the name of the toolthis was the petition i sent in to ccp devs they suggested i also post it in this thread
in the same vein that nowhere in eve is completely safe as has been stated multiple times by ganking groups in high sec i am extremely pleased to see this same attitude finally being applied in null sec as well for the sov system  in that it can be attacked by anyone  requires vigilance on the part of the group involved in its defenseperhaps if people had not been as extreme in their views about such i could be a bit more hesitant about the new inclusion of sovtrolls assaulting without intention of use  however with the repeated calls for less high sec  more gank options i see no problems with the system in its current state you got exactly what you wanted  more risks the difference is when it is applied to your own space instead of to others you now cry foul
thank you not sure why i didnt see it in that thread
ccp larrikin wrotehi space friendsthanks for those that attended the qa session today we appreciate those who took the time wed like to use this thread as a method of discussing jump fatigue ideassome of the interesting suggestions that wed heard and would like to see player opinions on altering jump ranges sovereignty effects on jump fatigue eg jumping out ofback into capitals reducing jump fatigue i really think that these two simple changes would make a huge improvement not only for general quality of life in nullsec but to encourage a bit more content imagine this all ships that currently have a 25ly base range are bumped up to 34ly 68ly max perhaps boost blops to 5ly too being in your alliances capital system or better yet constellation containing the capital causes some large benefit to jump fatigue but not jump cooldown either it decays much faster vanishes completely after a fixed time whatevernow any alliance will have the ability to project force quite quickly around their core systems but still cannot venture too far across the map other alliances who currently base in npc nullsec that want to invade or simply just mess with nearby groups will have a major incentive to carve out a little nearby system for themselves to gain these benefits also this in turn is a nice little recipe for conflictalyxportur wrotein the

hey lets look at the map through the filter of the old system instead of looking at it through the new system just because you dont claim sov over empty systems that dont matter doesnt mean you dont control them only defend space you think is really important  maybe stations or station systems  and then go dunk the other sides jump bridges cynojammers poses pocos and citadels for the bigger fights andor total dominationengland was able to control half the world with worse logistics than you guys currently have im sure you can figure out a way to maintain a large 00 empire again suck it up and adaptedit the purpose of the entosis links ought to be to make it easy for one side to take down afk structuressov  which probably should not include fueled poses  citadels also automated weapons systems that can pwn mwd frigates might want to be implemented
thats because britain had massive capital ship superiority meaning that no one else could have comparable logisticsthe british empire is actually an example i used in illustrating how improved communication logistics and power projection technology increase the maximum possible amount of territory a single group can coherently control
i wonder who else has massive cap ship superiority logistics and ability to project power across the universe  all the while having enough resources to defend their isolated home island in the upper left corner of europe err 00

this thread is proof that even in its incomplete state fozziesov is a success and what was needed to shake the status quo
1 lost interest at the wall of text
i am against the proposals in the petition i for ccp we all know why you are against such mechanics uaxdeath go to working
this is pretty important to be addressed imo as a new player still figuring everything out id probably quit the game after my year or two of skill trainings complete if this is really what null has become i joined up in eve for events like this
 1 fozziesov is pain now we really need some changes
u dicha popka prigorela norm
fully agree with thisfozziesov is aids and the games worse off for it
thats the thing it hasntall of the big sov holders are still the big sov holdersthe only difference is that large fights are all but unheard of now and everyone is so annoyed with the new mechanics that they arent even bothering to go back and laser nodes that have been out for over two weeksso if by shaken up you mean hit with a taser and thrown into the trunk sure

stuffz i can has
my alliance has had some epic fights since fozzie sov came outreally the only people who are complaining about fozzie sov are the huge renter alliances who are losing moneydue to fozzie sov my small alliance was able to claim and hold sov for the first time everit gives smaller groups a chance to establish themselvesand a message to xxdeathxx triumvirate and the rest of the renter alliancesif you are unable or unwilling to defend every single system in your huge swaths of territory then you do not deserve to hold themfozziesov hurts renter alliances and i love it
whats this thing capturing a system you guys are fuckin weirdnow if we could address how c5c6s are gloriously over saturated isk farms
agree
to everyone reading this thread remember that uaxdeath is our new csm member just think about that as you contemplate the thread and all that it entails
i hope you all quit eveno one cares about us lets go spam jita that will make people rally to our course
screw these guys they are literally the worst of the worst who never used their sov and just sucked nullsec dry for their  renting empiresrmt schemes do i care if alot of pl contracts came from xdeath nope cuz they almost all universally sucked sovbased occupancy is the way to go and if these worthless leeches dont like it then they can suck it
i kind of cared about this it was a very well written topic from you ua death howeverall of your dipshit legion guys make me not give a  about it 200 of you spamming jita local like a bunch of whining little girlsi hope you guys get trolled 247 for everif you are losing sov its because you dont deserve to have it
well i didnt bloody well vote for himto all the bittervets shitting up jita local and trying to force their way you arent the majority youre just the loudest and maybe its because im not bitter and not a vet yet but i actually like the new sov it opens things up for new smaller groups to nick off a small chunk of sov from the old crusty alliances id rather play that game than the one from 6 months ago
to be honest it didnt feel like they made it any worse than it usually is i dont care much less about their opinion than the usual scam spams
sign post 1
it appears that you didnt hold sov for very longi agree with my null sec brother that change is neededuaxdeath congrats on on your new csm status
personally i approve of fozziesov its allows the smaller yet unknown people to actually carry weight and have a chance at owning their own sov in null sec without having to join or rent the bigger alliance bullies who just want to own everything and rent everything for iskiesquite a number of unknown alliances have started making the eve influence map somewhat interestingso in actual factfozziesov working as intended
but your a bot you dont get to 1 we made you and we can watch you all die
we dont want to kill fozziesov we only want to make it less grindy and more fun read op post first please before comment
fozzie sov makes me not want to log in
you made me dad
the point is that we held it however fleeting and we will again that was impossible under the old mechanics your null brothers are leeches and dont deserve the sov that theyre crying about
and nothing of value was ever lost
this is all for contentonce the initial greifing is over you will see the map return to is normal statelarger alliances are allowing this to happen so they have some kind of contentfeel safe for a while if it makes you happy
what you didnt understad is that most of us me included completely like the idea to let small alliances comes and have their share of null what were asking is
most of null is not saying the a change was not needed just that in its current form fozziesov needs to be revamped i think if you read through the null sec responses you will find that most would just like the mechanic adjusted circling a dot while sov lasering it just isnt fun
nice old song cry me a river
i think you might be a bit more reasonable than your null brothers who are spamming jita local right nowsince were on the subject what would you propose instead
1everything here is obvious to people who have ever fought over sov
spamming in jita what is essentially a baww i cant rent out systems anymore thread sure is helping your cause im sure
1week ban for all people spamming jita that would also allow people enough time to clean most of that unused sov
i miss when we stopped renting or when we cried that new sov causing us problems renting
fire himthis is making eve a joke to play and with all the other kills of caps and other stuffsigned pettionccp start making the game fun again maybe play the actual game you nerfs and new additions are not making the game fun or adding new players missiles dont work pos lasers cannot hit a slow moving bomber mines lost capitals are useless
really upset with ccp better take it out on industrialists
signed signed and signedhauler joeanbd fire him to boot the way they killed the use of captital and the jump timerscapitals are dead battleships are dead ccp killed them
why dont you nullbears stop bitching about the game and play it you choose to live in nullsec so man the  uprant end
a crackerto go with your wine
unlike most people here i actually read what uaxdeath wrote i agree with everything except for the first and last comment the first solution forces massive capital drops on predetermined areas the idea of new sov was to get away from these super mega dump fights the game cant support itthe last which is the sov transfer needs work but its most widely used use is to transfer sov to renters or for sale ive never been a fan of renter alliances sov sales etc that doesnt mean it should exist
the first two points are a relic of alliances with bloated amounts of space being transitioned out of that state of being once that shift takes place and their holdings are reduced to systems they use those problems will solve themselves stop whiningthe rest of your points especially related to the ui and sov transfer should get looked at
looks like russians are ganking in jita as a protestsee lots of content being created by the new changes 
small new pilot that has its second contact to sov first with the prefozziesov i see some issues with the entosis link itself trollceptors but overall i dont see that much of problem of the new sov opposed to the old one paperwork what about eve spreadhseet everyone is giggling about big massive fights lock up that primary there in 5 minutes you will start shooting it after locked up not agreeing 100 on that petition but i agree there are some balances needed here and there opinion of a small pilot that likes fozziesov
stop crying
we cant rmt anymore so were going to go to jita and complain about it
spamming jita like that practically screams were weak we cant handle new sov rules conquer us
there are over 3700 alliances in eveyou have been supported by 15your 02 majority really makes me think this is a good investmentif you want content generate it by refusing to use super caps or taking gates for decemberreally what are your alliances campaigns anywaywhats your alliances current objectives pvp wise in eve who is your enemyyou absolutely better know this and have your entire alliance following these objectives or youre not really leading an alliance youre just a congregation
no1 cares about bope  off and get out of my alliance kthx
feel free to leave and get out of pl then
it is like a thousand russian rmters screamed in unison and then were silentplease bring on the silent bit when your rmt dollars dry up and your morgages and car payments come due
its hilarious how theyre in jita wasting isk instead of using their manpower to defend their space i wonder if anyones taking advantage of this
ccp you have to trust players
hello russiansfozzy sov is doing exactly what the creators intended it to do which is the followingmake it so that a big alliance can not hold a huge amount of empty spacethat is exactly what you have been doing for almost the past decadei live in a wh when i get a connection to malpias cobalt edge the kelevala expans etherium reach outer passage oasa it is completely empty bar a few select systems that have stations  and on the way to said stations there are capsules sitting 300k off a gate that seem to be automated clients  alarm systems to bootthe whole point of fozzy sov was to stop people like you holding so much empty spacethe fact that you use this space as your rmt empire is kinda insultingthe fact that you have now gone to jita to protest against fozzie sov purely because its hurting your rmt empire is even more laughablewe  players outside of your rmt empire welcome fozzie sov
players you have to trust ccp
pretty sure neither one of those things will ever happen
hey rusruswhile youve been crying in jita weve just had a glorious fight with 470 in local over a station timeranyway better luck on monday eh
id rather stick my head into a tigers mouth due to having a better chance of my trust being rewarded
ahh natural selection ive missed you
lamo someone in isbad with the god of kite calling other corps 
no really id say my odds are much better of keeping my head than ccp being competent at game design it took them 6 years to make dominion sov okay ish and then came this atrocity
new changes are great but not perfect it just sounds like these leaderships are complaining more than problem solving still great fights are going on carriers cant blob 40 times a dayrereading their post i want to give them credit for saying something other than rollback would have much rather them put this in a intellectual thinktank suggestion format rather than a riotous whiney tone 1 for suggestions
1 to this fozzie sov is horrible and has wrecked sov ccp  ask any one of the sov alliances how can you just ignore this listen to your null sec inhabitants
1he is making very valid points and not any outrageous suggestions
1despite people whining that this relates to rental income the op is right this system puts null holders on the defensive during vulnerability timers which undermines the ability to fight for content elsewhere
which is why you get to set your vulnerability timer to when you are active if you are unable to defend your space during the period of time that your alliance is most active means that you do not deserve to live in that spacea lot of the tears being generated here is a direct result of people holding space that they do not have the numbers to defendthe obvious solution is for them to get with the program  cut down on all the empty space that they cannot defend and either fill it with renters that will actively use the system or just relinquish the space  allow randoms to move in then tell said people pay us security money or well blap your space again  if you cannot defend the space you have laid claim too  you do not deserve to keep it
youre missing the pointif you set your timers to when you are most active all of your guys are sitting in their space on the off chance someone comes to take it however no ones coming to take it because everyone else is doing the exact same thing you see the problem here
introductionevery problem you sited is exactly the way it is supposed to work  it limits mega alliances from controlling vast swathes of space it allows low sp players to participate in the best part of eve i agree there are some minor tweaks needed conclusionsome xxdeath guy is just mad because he cant keep his slaveling rental alliances running without doing any real work the op  go fly a kite
thats funny coming from a guy whos alliance head is a signatorylooks like you might be in with the wrong crowd chief
the problemas a new player you are granted bonus remaps which is a good help for players to mess around with attributes to enhance their training timesas a semi new player of around 1 year with no remaps available i have made the mistake of altering my attributes in a way which greatly reduces my skill points for which i intend to focus and as a result i have to wait a whole year before i can fix this mistake for new players this is a problem as we are already at a great disadvantage from veteran players regarding skill pointssolutiona simple solution would be to reduce the time for neural remaps to around 3 months this way the impact of making a bad choice with remaps is reduced significantlyanother solution would be to introduce a new skill for neural enhancement which will reduce the regeneration time between remaps per level please give your thoughts and feedback for this idea
its asked on a regular basis so much in fact there is another thread on this page with an idea regarding extra remapsmy answer there is the same to thisdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
entosis links should be for dead poses and sov

while i can appreciate your enthusiasm liam i think you may have been far better off spending the 6 months before csm applications actually open researching the csm and what they do etc as well as networking in gameas it stands you dont really have the understanding of what the csm actually is and what you would be getting yourself into and since youre a new player your chances of getting elected without some pretty intense networking is pretty lowif you still want to run in 6 months then absolutely go for it but maybe sit on it for a while and figure out some stuff first
if there are two people in a room and both of them agree then one of them is useless  mark twain thankfully there are lots of people in our crowd that have different perspectives
fair point though one would expect an alliance head to speak for the whole or at least the majority such is why we do not have a signatory even though many of our members are outspoken critics of this terrible sov iteration
even myself i dont live there but i do agree with what has been spoken to all of fozzieccp before all hell breaks loose the way fozzieccp sov is set i agree with the null sec people the thing is doing so as is will and can be a pain but they do have the same rights as if you attacked the pos or sov structure when they have there own personal gates then that speed can be set or reduced depends on ship  what wrong with large fleets fighting is a node totally seperate from the high sec grids which still can be felt needs to be fixed what was said here i am in total agreement personally everyone in null sec has there rights to be heard but hey dont ever limit the fun what ever it is they all want to do if a war comes i can see all of them ganging up on ccp i know the battle would be harsh but ccp realise this they will hunt you down and tear you to shreads so do you want an all out war hmm i bet not
you obviously either didnt read my post or lack the capacity to comprehend it my point was that timezone overlap means active alliance remain in their home systems during vulnerability timers to defend rather than roaming around to fight everyone being on the defensive during their busiest time zone generates a lack of content edit just read further good to see i wasnt unclear because gallowmere obviously understood my point

im out of popcorn  sakes i need more popcorn
i just checked some things 1 on a activly used and therefore fully upgraded system the vulnerable time window is 3hours big devblog once mentioned 4hours2 on a fully upgraded system entosing something takes around 60minutes 3 according to devblog everyone in system gets a message  notifcation about the attack so you dont have to sit all the time and wait to defend these objects having one or two altscouts in system should be far enough to catch the message of an attacker to call back part of the fleet it doesnt always have to be one big bulk of ships for everything counternumbers1 totally unused system beside moonmining takes 10minutes to entose2 totally unused system has a vulnerable timewindow up to 18hoursyou didnt need that space anyway thats why its so hard to defend
1 to the original post
i like fozzie sovyou guys in 00 shouldnt have that much space and power let smaller alliances have some too
good luck have you tried to take sov in a standard small alliance in fozziesov its not going to happen unless its dead worthless space that isnt worth the time of day contesting
add me and my alliance to this petitionbut i believe we wont accomplish anything with it ccp got what they wanted with this stable servers
no its unprotected if you leave it unprotectedfrankly i find your list of demands followed by an or else to be infantile and utterly unbecoming for a memeber of the csm even if you were a second choicestep upstart acting like an adult and stop being part of the problem

there are some good points mainly  entosis should stop a ship or at least shut its prop mods that would remove most trolls  important  in game interface where all data is visible at a glance  somewhat important  reducing the number of nodes  possibly important
i support this as a proviblock membersince this new sov mechanic theres been few big fights in provi goons didnt show up to take provi with the new mechanics prove enough that the mechanic is broken and non rewarding all the large scale battles in eve have come to a halt normally a hostile fleet would ref a hubstation to get the attention for a huge fight but now all you have to do is send a a small detachment of snipers to take out the ship that ethosis the structure and be done with it ccp in the past you made good decisions and bad ones like the productionresearch teams which you guys removed after it being a complete failure rethink about this sov mechanic because its killing your players with boredom eve24news has rarely reports of huge battles since this new sov mechanic and are now reporting that provi is being camped by hotdroppers which we have always been 3 youre killing the player base with all of thisfozziesovjump fatiguemassive decrease in null to null wormholesstop messing up your player base and listen to them dont be like the politicians of this world because everyone hates politicians
like what industry moon harvesting wh and stuff like thatgo ahead but you own that system only as much as you are willing to defend it and keep it populatedif you dont like trollceptors too bad o7
the problem with this statement is that it makes you out to believe that there is this group of underprivileged players who just wish they could take some sov of their own spoiler alert there isnt if there were we wouldnt be making money hand over fist with the new rental modelthis actually appears to be becoming even more true now that players are seeing just how awful these new sov mechanics are those who want sov already have it the rest will continue to be dead systems because there is no reason for anyone to invest the effort and resources into taking and holding them trollceptoring is easy holding space after the fact is still at the whim of anyone bigger who doesnt want them there your small alliance that can field 50 guys what do you think would happen if we decided we didnt like you and rolled through with a few hundred trollceptorsyeah exactly nothing has been fixed its just been made somehow more mind numbing than structure shoots
as a simple minion i support this petition
i support this petitionit shows problems and also solutions for known problems in neraly every 00 spacehopfully ccp will hear

ccp will not change this with this sovchange you have to use your brain for once and not throw everything you got at itthis looks like a desperate way to avoid loosing sov this game needs some fresh air and it wont happen with all the same alliances holding sovit gets boring and it does not change by reversing the changes and turn the own sov into a inpenetrable fotress sov changes were made to see some progress in sov and this patch is made to make your chair wobble because currently there is absolutely no progress in sovchanges and thats a stagnation ccp wont allowobviously this patch scares the hell out of you which is totally the purpose and it looks like it works
fozzy sov is a great change for eve most of the space in the drone region have so much unused systems that you cant count them you dont need that much space if you wantneed it be prepaire to defend it but dont whine cos you dont have the numbers or the will power to do many jumps each night to defend systems you dont live in i dont feel sorry for you at allbig blue blobs is a disease in eve and alliances that hold on to space that they dont live in only feeds this it stagnates the gamei do also support for ccp to add the tools in game to support fozzy sov changes and not having to relly on other external appsfozzy sov is the best thing that could have happened to eve i only wished it was done 5 years ago eve would have not been this dead end blue garbage thats turned to this is suppose to be null and most dangerous part in space in reality you should be at risk of losing space all the time like any front line it will always get shelled and must have a no mans land
i have lived in nulsec since 2009 i do not support this petition do not speak for methe community which op represents are the worst of the worst when it comes to actual content they would have ccp revert to dominion sov which supported and even mandated vast sprawling empires of unused space with massive fleets of spheavy capital ships jumping across the galaxy in minutesmany of the signatory alliances of this petition are historically known to be the worst offenders of botting and rmt the true intent of this petition is clear for anyone that has played eve online for long enough they wish a return to farming nulsec with vast armies of bots fueling their alliance coffers andor their rl bank accountsso no i do not and will not ever support this kind of blatantly and obviously selfserving petition and implore ccp to flat out ignore it
i dont support this petitionccp is right in changing the gameplay for some fresh airtheir will be more stratetic descisions in defending and attacking sov i think all of this big alliances are feared cause they have to split their strikeforces and have to rationing all the sovsystems to get a greater defensebonusthat means they have much work thats them an eyesoreccp please hold your course for the sovchanges i support your decisions
1screaming selfentitlement but lets take it down anyway i love doing that1 critically reduces chances for large scale fightsyou mean like blue donut id say this is a critical increase compared to blue donut so no this is bs2 harassment 
1 dont necessarily agree with the suggested changes to correct but anything is better than the current system
that and almost the entirety the list consists of entities that are either hostile to the imperium or russian rmt slum lordsno amount of washing will get the stains off from signing that thing this all assuming that the petition raises legitimate points and those are few and far between

im here just to hang out on the threadnought
citation neededfirst off ccp rarely release the names of alliances housing bots secondly someone botting or rmting in an alliance doesnt mean that alliance itself is responsible for it i guarantee every moderate to large group has a number of players rmting in it even your ownat the end of the day the mechanics theyve rolled out are crap and have reduced conflict in null if the best argument against it youve got is a tinfoil hat theory that they need dominion sov back to bot which in itself is insane as fewer systems now make more isk and rattingmining is now a required activity likely resulting in more botting then you really wont get very farcorrect wrong systems are now easier to hold and while large alliances can hold less total space they need less as each system supports more people this system makes it harder to take sov from a larger alliance that wants it and once its settled down youll simply see large alliances using these small alliances that are moving in on the outskirts as farming for pvpers if you think youll be able to move a 100 man alliance into a sov system next door to a 10k alliance and not get roflstomped daily youre having a laugh
i support this petition
1 for the reasons given here and everywhere else i have posted
i created a similar post only to be told that this thread existed so i will voice my opinion here instead i agree 100 a simple solution would be to reduce the time for neural remaps to around 3 months this way the impact of making a bad choice with remaps is reduced significantlyanother solution would be to introduce a new skill for neural enhancement which will reduce the regeneration time between remaps per level
this seems wildly abusive to anyone with enough cash or isk i would much rather see the whole remap system scrapped instead
this is internet spaceships youre gonna get bullied called names in locals and blown up on reddit if your loss was expensive thats the way it is and it will never change
waaaahhhhhh this is awesome i dont even have to log in to drink up some bear tears finally a forum topic that can fill my appetite for tears on the go f0U009Ff0U009FU00ADf0U009Ff0U009FU00A2f0U009FU00A9f0U009FU00A8f0U009FU00ADf0U009FU00B0f0U009FU00B1f0U009FU00BFf0U009FU00B9f0U009FU00A7f0U009FU00A6
well sense any one can make a petition what they dont like i may as well jump on the train so i counter petition that the listed names in the collective petition about fozziesov need to drop out of the 100 of the sov they own and the 90 they dont use and only have its because of the terms we want to rent it out be removed and given to alliance groups and areas for actly war not to be a trailer park this goes to all of drone space an any bodies or other groups of the renters alliance after they release said space from the the grips of said none use then their views can actly amount for something a till then its will be seen as the cries for i win button and i have 100 systems but we only use 5 of them comment suggestions and debate are welcomed
why bother building mining or even doing anything on a pve only server the market would be saturated  minerals would be worthless why build ships they wont ever get blown up this is maybe the worst idea of the year
wheres the dislike button on this forum
thanks for the advice i will address this is the other post and this can be closed
ccp continues to make eve look more beautiful by the day updating ship models shaders asteroid belts effects sounds etc etc still i miss something i had experienced in the long gone past which made the game for me an amazing place to be in a living environment in the past some of the eve ratting missions or anoms had amazing background space tornadoes gas eruptions electrical storms etc
my fellow capsulersi would like to formally announce to you that i am actively running for a position of csm in 2016 like many i would like to see this eve experience grow and continue to enrich our lives with thrills excitement and satisfy our lust for exploration as a representative coming from wormhole space i look forward to being a voice from that community to the council that many feel is unheard i have been a part of many of the areas of eve over my time hereUFFFD nullsec lowsec highsec and wormholes i have been around since release in may 2003 when it was called a mining simulator clashed with early devUFFFDs in the dawning of battleships burnt out like many and vacationed from space only to return here and there like many love affairs do finding my home in the exciting world of worm holes like many i want my experience to grow grow fairly in each environment and for each environment to have a voice to growth moving forward this compels me to throw in my hat to join in 2016 and be a part of the council i wish to represent not only wormholerUFFFDs but give a voice to many that enjoy this game to work with ccp to help enrich the game from prospective that many are convinced have no voice in real life i am a professional it consultant and a fantasy author i have experience working with developers on a daytoday basis yet understand the enjoyment of the escape of a good story this is my history my experience and reason for putting in my hat for the 2016 council i believe i would give voice for many and understand the needs for many throughout the eve galaxy let me be your voice on the counsel and a member that gets involved to help this experience grow vote for me and i will work diligently to work with ccp and other council members to grow this experience to another levelthank you for your timexiapathos
so let me get this straightccp with the release of fozziesov managed to break your shiny when it comes to sov and now you want it either quickly changed to something startlingly similar to what was in place before or rolled back until a better iteration is brainstormed and passes the sisi feedback thread sniff testi say to those at this wailing wall what was suggested to us offering rage tears and great gnashing of teeth about the icongate complaintsevolve or move onso its a little different when its your shiny on the line jevens keyboardist
UFFFDa man who does not think for himself does not think at allUFFFD  oscar wilde i think thats more like it
1i felt a great disturbance in the force as if hundreds of botters suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happenedshadow of xxdeathxx hold sov in 242 systems ill wager that this allance would struggle
and hes such an expert when was the last time he even logged in and undocked anything
i completely disagreei would think that the over all effect of trying to defend shouldnt be as one sided as you suggest the tiring and discouraging task of a long drawn out fleet roam leading no victory would be of great benefit to those who took the effort of trolling in the first place they would then be able to act on it at a later time once fleet moral is lost or drained as a pilot who roams nulsec from an outsiders point of view i noticed most groups sov is unused space hence it taking so long for large groups to defend it a 6 hour defense fleets is in no way the fault of ccp or of the trolling shipfleet you choose to occupy this space you choose the chore of defending it and yes it should be a chore defending other wise there would be no down side to owning so much space all reward no risk is not the way of life in eve as all pilots learn in the early yearsas for wanting large scale engagements not all alliances can even field such things this leads to groups no being able to partake in nulsec at all wo joining one side or an other we seen how these so called epic battles effected nulsec as of the past few years when the majority of nulsec was owned by 2 groups n3 and cfc coalitions this did in fact lead to stale nulsec activity relying on such tactics makes it nearly impossible for any alliance to join take hold and grown in nulsec space with out being forced into said large groups case in point brave brave moved to nulsec in the south soon after where forced back out of nulsec by larger groups capable of bullying them to the breaking pointi feel that more changes leading to smaller groups being able to both take and defend sov while taxing larger groups holding large amounts of sov should be encouraged
hi guysi see a lot of you saying i dont support this petition the mechanic is fine there is no problems others say the alliances which say that they agree with this petition are mostly renters like shadow of xxdeathxx to the guys who says that i would say have you tryed defending or attacking a system yeti did so i can say if aegissov is a sucess or not in my opinion this sytem is broken its been there for 1 month and im already bored what were the goals of aegis sov you can read them on this devblog politics by other meansthe list of the goals and why they are failure1st goal as much as possible ensure that the process of fighting over a star system is enjoyable and fascinating for all the players involvedthe old system was a little boring you had to shoot a structure and kill it before and after rf now we have the entosis if you are an attacker you wait depending on the adm between 5min new system taken and 60mins first to reinforce the structure and after just to take one node so if the attacker is the only one to take node he has to take 10nodes i let you do the math the defender dont have to form a fleet he only has to break the lock of the entosis ship itll buy him time or kill quickly the entosis ship goal 2 clarify the process of taking holding and fighting over star systemswith the trollceptor a lot of people just entosis structure just to  off the owner they dont even try to take the sov with this mechanics you dont really know if you are being attack or notgoal 3 minimize the systemic pressure to bring more people or larger ships than would be required to simply defeat your enemies on the field of battlewith this mechanics people want to take the node quickly so you just have to bring more alt the get the nodes people dont split the fleets because you dont know if your ennemie will split his fleetgoal 4 drastically reduce the time and effort required to conquer undefended spacethis one is half a success goal 5 provide significant strategic benefits from living in your spacethis one was already succeeded nothing changedgoal 6 spread the largest sovereignty battles over multiple star systems to take advantage of new edenUFFFDs varied geography and to better manage server loadas i said before you cant split your fleet if the ennemie dont split his fleetgoal 7 any new sovereignty system should be adaptable enough to be rapidly updated and to incorporate future changes to eveyou cant have a perfect system yes i agree with that but you cant release something not finished if half the idea is good you have no good idea your goals are failure you wanted 00 to change you wanted less empty system yeah i get it but any alliance who wants to take 00 system has to get others blue alliance to help them you cant change this fact with this the best change for the 00 was jump fatigue and i dont want to change it or may be for the jump freighter or black ops thanks to phoebe conflicts are more local how many system are rf and not taken how many sytem are now unclaimed here is the tenerifis map itll give you an idea
its literally too much to expect us to undock a rlml caracal and a couple of tackle frigates to defend our sov during our prime
undockbut thats boring
who moved my cheese
the fact that you are even duelling within docking range speaks volumes about you whether you big yourself up as one of the last honourable knights of eve or not never mind that this is highsec you should at the very least drop a can 150km or so from the station exit and set up your own house of fun
has it been looked at on how much of this jump fatigue is making the cost of plex stay at its current ratehow about the flow of mins  materials and items in and out of null
there are lots of timers in their space feel free to go take it from them nothing is stopping you
get off your lazy scrub arse and take some sov then
nah you have to be in an alliance to mess with sov
go play wow
closed at ops request and the fact that this threads content already exists
unclaimed or effectively unclaimed systems are not an indication of failure the idea that every system should be inarguably owned is a toxic holdover from the dominionprephoebe era opportunities for ambitious homesteaders are a good thingas for the map yes lets look at the map shall webeforeafter
signed
so before we coloured the map in 4 colours for cfc nc provi and neutral and after we colour in the map for each alliance that way it looks like huge amounts have changed that about rightunclaimed systems are a sign that sov is not worth taking to the point that people leave systems they could just walk in and claim uncontested its because most people dont want sov they just dont want coalitions to have it either
why are you still in a 00 alliance
ops posts are cyberbullying the entire eve community ban op
if only there was a way to export  import your entire ui
suggestioncompletely remove jump fatigue when jumping between systems that have sovereignty held in your alliancewe all know the issues surrounding jf so i wont delve into them again implementing my suggestion will still stop capital fleets jumping to the other side of eve but it will vastly improve the life of living in the home region of your alliancewhat are peoples thoughts
easily abuseable badly thought out and no consideration given to possible consequencesnext
so i just own one system on the edge of jump range in my coalitions space and one more system on the edge on the far side of thati hop quickly out of my space and into the tiny islands that are set up in my coalitions controlled space i do this until i get to where i want to be this is a bad idea further it belongs in fandi stop fouling up the assembly hall with offtopic threads
because i liked null and hold out hope ccp wont destroy it in the long run nice dodge though bro
well i ask because apprently youre so unfamiliar with the state of 00 that youre unaware that the sov map is vastly more heterogenous than it was
id say vastly is an overstatement some of the russian borderland have been hacked up and a couple of groups have pulled out of null but the changes havent been that big my comment however was simply that youve taken 2 different style of map and compared them why not use the same type of map if you want to get across how much the landscape has changed
if you could link a more up to date bloc map id be delighted to use it
i dont have such a map if you dont either then its probably better to simply avoid suggesting that looking at 2 different types of map shows the change maybe at some point someone that cares enough about such things will roll out a decent analysis of the changes
there you go
thanks got another one with the same groupings from last yeardoesnt it make you wonder though why the space is so worthless that nobody wants to claim it i cant stick a broken fridge outside my house for more than 10 minutes before someones claimed it how badly balanced do null systems need to be for them to be so unwanted
no the map is generated on a daily basis i dont know if past maps are stored somewherei like that analogy the reason why someone takes the fridge is because it is obviously worthless to you but not to them would they wrestle a pitbull for it no but if its previous owner doesnt want it anymore they might as well take it and see if they can find a use for it somehow i would love the new mechanic to lead to that kind of thing in terms of 00 space
they are stored on eve files
thats a shamethat would be nice unfortunately most sov space is worth about as much as a low class wormhole not the type of thing a passer by is likely to say ooh this is nice
if space is so worthless how come any of it is claimed
its not that its completely useless its that its low value in massive quantities its ok to most people though taking a few systems is worth less than just moving into a wh or living in npc null and none of it is really worth massive battles these days hence the lack of real conflict in null itd be nice if there were good reasons to fight over it
acutally k898 was right they are stored on eve files heres the one from exactly one year ago
dejavu i created the exact same thread a year ago found it
when will it be out will it be ndaed is it a topdown document ccp  csm does the prologue have any metaphysics about new eden society please hire tony gonzales to write that in the source
this thread has been moved to the market discussions board
i wonder if we added to those maps the headcountsystem and relationship between that and crying about the current system
with 1635 members an alliance holds 234 sovereignty that is the problem and we all hope fozziesov will fix it none should stop trying to make new eden better space for all
little kid visit his dad hey dad may i go outside  sure but just be carefull son there are strangers on the street and im not always arround
right after fanfest as usualfanfest was from march 19th to 21st this year
never were still standing up my feet hurtpretty much just after fanfest it takes a little time to get everything sorted out
thanks guys this is for some content creationi did search for this date but didnt find a firm referencein march of 2015 i barely understood what a carebear was let alone make time to follow the larger eve communitystevei havent even built mine yet but maybe the victorieux has or can be retrofitted to have a chaise lounge befitting a csm member
whats ok about massive quantities given that the primary wealth generators in sov 00 are the anomalies which improve in quality and quantity as the indexes are increased for an alliance the size of init 2 constellations would be ample  we actually have more space than we need sharing tenal with rzr when citadels are introduced allowing multiple structures per system then the incentive to consolidate will increase even furtheraint mean we wont fight for what we have though we might even use our super special spacemagic power of undocking and having funthe common theme i see running through this thread and others like it is people complaining about having a bad time when they try and engage with aegis sov as if it were dominion sov youve put more effort into telling everyone youre not having fun trying to do things the old way in a new system than ive put into actually having fun in it and im having plenty of fun tyvmyour cheese has been moved its time to cast aside old assumptions about the right way to do things and take a fresh look
another day another couple of fun fights in sov space hows sitting in station crying working out for you
i would say make it a station service similar to the security offices used to repair sec status it would be a much needed money sink
i always hated these kind of people that say we have to stop bullying honestly you never going to stop bullying from happening its by far more effective to teach somebody to stand up for themselves then it is to put a temporary stop to one bully because if you stop some from bullying a victim you may stop that one bully but down the road your not going to be there to stop the  boss or the prick of a coworker if you teach them to stand up to a bully they can handle their own  down the road when your not there to do it for them deletetheweak
sorry if this is covered elsewhere if so please refer it to me i would like to ask why there is no non pvp toggle for ships that are not pvp capable or for people that dont want to do pvp or areas designated for pvp i have been killed several times in a mining ship and an exploration ship then told to stop playing miners and explorers and learn to pvp i have banned this game in my home game shop and meeting soon with other shops in area to implement the same when someone flying a battle ship brags about killing a lone miner this game is no longer fun or playable the gms ive talked to gave me the ships back but the problem still remains even though my ships was returned to me what happens to the person responsible for attacking me and what is to stop others from attacking miners trying to play the game hes still bragging about killing a miner on his so called kill board why is killing a miner on kill boards to begin with the problem is still there there needs to be non pvp toggle flags to stop people who dont want to participate in pvp being forced into pvp or designated pvp areas that people know there going into swtor has a pvp toggle flag for pvp also world of warcraft has a pvp system if there asked to participate in pvp through a request why is there no pvp toggle flag for people in this game ive been a loyal subscriber to ddo since alpha testing and still a subscriber to everquest 1 and 2 and world of warcraft i love supporting games and recommend them to others in my area on game nites and weekends this is an awesome game i am retired stay at home play for 1620 hours at a time i am also advising the parents in our area to not let kids in area play this game when people can fly into any area and kill others for no reason thats wrong there is about 26 people who will not subscribe to this game in my area now cause of this issue please let me know how this is going to be resolved
this is a pvp game if you cant take that go back to hello kitty online or whereverit is you came fromfrankly you shouldnt be getting ships back from gms you should probably learn to fit the things instead of crying on the forums about losing them
it will not be resolved to your satisfaction eve is a 12 year old sandbox game that features fulltime pvp at the core of its design the new pilot faq goes into detail but the game is a single universe competitive sandbox game quite unlike the traditional mmos that you are used to honestly if you cant handle losing ships to other players this game is not for you ships are lost all the time and should be treated as expendable you can make yourself pretty safe especially in highsec but other players are going to try to stop you or take your stuff from timetotime that is just how the game has been designed if you think you can learn to handle that new eden is quite the experience if not there is no shame is choosing a game that more suits your sensibilities regardless of what you choose you should work harder to treat your fellow gamers with more respect than you have in the past they are just other people playing a video game for fun not punching bags to vent your rage at
well i have moved on from eve and this game will not be played again in my home or game shop till pvp toggle is implemented i have treated gamers with respect that is earned not given code needs to be banned from this game for killing miners like i told them then i cancelled 30 subs for kids in my store that i paid for before the 30 days was up now ccp lost 31 customers counting me cause of this i have made ships and fitted them and given them away to new players and got bounties placed on me for it i asked a reasonable question 4 days left on my sub and i will not support this game any longer like you said if i dont like it move on fyi i have moved on i only asked the dev to enhance the game to bring back new players and what they are looking for instead of 5000 players online to a max of 26000 there could be alot more players but i see my time is wasted asking intelligent people for a response i guess when it gets down to less than 5000 players on at a time maybe someone will fix this game instead a rage about its a pvp game if you dont like it quit best of luck with getting new palyers to stay
it will not why would ccp do this after 12 years because you feel entitled to play the game in way completely different from how it was designed thats like showing up at a baseball game and demanding the umpire to turn the game into a homerun derby just because you do not like to take the field or be scored upon it is not going to happendont let the the door hit your bottom on the way out
nice source
i cannot speak to what may or may not be under active discussion because of the those pesky three letters nda but i will say that i have been begging for the white paper to be a living document rather than a historical artifactm

the more you have the easier it is to defend if youre fully utilising your space then 100 people working in 2 systems will be more efficient that 2 sets of 50 in one each scaled up that continues so when you hold a couple of constellations and fully utilise it the effort to defend it balances out better with the rewards from itmost people arent having fun even when playing it as aegis sov mate its a mining laser and a structure thats what the bulk of the mechanic is add to that the most efficient way of attacking sov is by using lots of uncatchable ships and its a textbook example of a bad mechanic the mechanic should be engaging and fun for all parties but its not clearly there are plenty of groups of people who see it as nothing but a chore to play whackamole to defend systemscongratulations i guess if ccps aim was make malcanis happy while clearly the vast majority of null players find the new mechanics boring as sin then its a win im not generally docked we still have fights much less than normal dotlan stats show down 16 afaik but less doesnt mean none and neither am i crying this is called providing feedback on game mechanics youre not so good at trolling these days bro
yes have your space and live in it and you will reap the rewards watching the tournament yesterday i saw ads aimed at carebears that offered space to pve in unsurprisingly those ads were made by the imperium as they seem to have understood how this new sov mechanic works and are adapting more people in 00 gives more targets to roaming gangs makes more need for defensive gangs makes more pvp content i hope we can agree that thats a good thingthat too is a good thing it should require effort to defend your space so that you only defend your space if you acutally need it by the way fighting for sov has only ever been interesting if someone fights back this has not changed since the servers booted up for the first time and it will not change until the day ccp pulls the plugreading some of the posts in this thread i wonder if anyone has actually bothered to watch this
yes it should require effort but it should be entertaining thats the goal of fozziesov and thats where it falls down for most people involved its not very funyou may want to just accept crappy game mechanics many people would rather provide feedback and have them turned into good game mechanics its why we attend roundtables and the like to provide feedback on the game and its why the csm exists fozziesov could be good and fun for all but currently its not
be honest have you watched the video
nope i was in the audience
that must have been awesome i admit i am a bit jealous reading through some of the things you posted i would have never guessed
yeah was fun what that ive posted has made you think thatthe way i see it the goals have always been1 make sov entertaining for all players involved  this i feel has failed most players attacking sov are doing so to troll they dont want sov they just want to waste peoples time by forcing them to chase them about its very amusing im sure for the people doing the trolling but its the equivalent of wider spread blueballing for defenders in addition when you are taking or defending sov properly most of the fleet is sitting about waiting while the entosis crew run around doing stuff because entosis doesnt benefit from more players if you bring 20 players most of them have nothing to do if theres no engagement for this i suggest increasing the minimum size of ship for fitting an entosis bc would be a good choice how to get the whole fleet involved in capture i dont know the system seems to be inherently boring if you dont get an engagement perhaps a much more rapid takeover or defense of space if completely uncontested would be good2 make the system to contest sov simpler this has been a success the only thing id suggest here is more ingame info as info available on crest should always be available in game so that everyone can access it with ease3 ensure the system directs you to bring fleets that defeat your enemy and measures success on control of the grid  this is partially working but with evasion fit ships you can just spread out over the system into small fleets who couldnt actually control the grid hoping that one or two of them get through as you successfully trigger timers you make it so that the defender has even more locations to go to to reset the systems and it continues to grow from there there will likely be a large scale demonstration of why this is bad soon empty systems sure they should be sure easy to take but occupied systems shouldnt be under threat from tiny evasion fit fleets those types of ships should remain primarily for scouting and intercepting a target for a fleet not to actually run the takeover for this i suggest letting systems naturally reset if aggressors dont continue the takeover of sov and requiring multiple entosis links to get a sov capture started with a higher adm
allow multiple clone jumps daily if done from the same station or systemi think a change like this would make a great many of us pilots happy while at the same time not skirting a system that was put in place primarily to prevent players from getting around the galaxy too easilyany downsides to this anyone can think of
as a player that only had his jump clones in two systems next to each other i can agree i didnt use them to travel it was dependant on what ship i was requested to usethis has been requested before a few times but the clone system seems to have issues with the amount of clones at a station i guess its old code as far as downsides are concerned there could well be some im not seeing many atmdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
the main downside is that it completely circumvents the choice you are suppose to make between the advantages of each clone it allows you to benefit from combat enhancing bonus while undocked and learning enhancement bonuses or industry bonus  when docked essentially at the same time you get to have your cake and eat it too  you are suppose to choose enhanced training or enhanced combat effectiveness i think it would be better to at least remove learning implants completely before implementing this otherwise you just make it mandatory to hop to your training clone every time before you log off reducing the mechanic to pointless busywork but if implants were all just combatresource gathering buffs i see no reason why you shouldnt be able to hop from a frigate clone to bs clone or a armour clone to a shield clone or a mining to a combat clone in the same station it would reduce the consequence of the choice a little you can fly both frigates and battleships with bonuses on the same day but wouldnt really break anything and might encourage people to undock i am sort of on the fence i think though ccp wont touch it in any case until they revisit the attribute and learning implant situation
well i did consider the whole learning implant and training situation but dismissed it mostly due to ccps current view on attributes and their removal chances are more than ever that theyll end up going although by no means a certaintywhile i do see the point made in regards to having your cake and eating it i have another view to it sure some will change their clones and move into another for combat pvp but many like me will be jumping into ones with pirate implants like those pilots i would like to utilise the clones i have already i want to risk them in pvp i want to use them to their full ability but ship choice is often made because of what clone im in a rather strange mechanic to have in that regardi dont think the cost risk is an issue in this situation as pirate implants and the hardwirings that tend to come with have a higher cost sure some may jump into clones with no implants but will this only occur with learning implants some use learning implants as an excuse not to pvp but ive never believed that reasoning theyll find some other reason not to anyway even if this change happenedso yes while the training cake is there i agree its an issue but if ccp decide to remove attributes and give everyone a flat rate then it may be a different storydestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
this is obviously a troll deletetheweak
can i have your stuff
agreeddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
still as a final parting shot
locked
the riskreward factor is adequately served by undocking
but once moved to your base you would never have to undock in your learning clone and yet still benefit from it whenever you were logged off or even in station and also benefit from your combat clone all the time when you undock at least now you have to choose one or the other i am not saying that doesnt have its own problems but allowing you to switch between them at will removes the tradeoff between the two choices you get full combat effectiveness with no ok minimal while undocked loss in training bonus
submitted by corevamore bolmarapart one additional partsdetails follow this postthis is a proposal for a new type of sov isov that builds on the current system encompass upcoming game additions while reducing overall complexity enhancing stability of long term held systems yet provides many opportunities for conflict pew pewoverviewphilosophy a single battle doesnt win the war occupational ownership doesit is easy to enter anothers territory shoot stuff up and run away however to gain the respect of the locals you need to secure the territory develop it populate it and make that territory your own the roman empire was built in such a way this helps to ensure that both pvp and industrial players are both catered for enhancing game play and boosting eve subscriber numberswhat is being addedan influence based system that determines who owns a systemwhat is being enhancedthe strategicmilitaryindustry indexes were steps in the right direction the isov system based on influence both enhances grading of a system and replaces some of itwhat is being removedthe entosis link activated spawn system UFFFD it is a video game mechanic not something that has any correlation with logic nor reality in space it jars against the reality that is eve and is a dumb contest point just to provide pew pew battle action lets fight over sensible things the influence based sov system isovinfluence in a solar system is determined bythe number of structures in a systemthe types of structures in a systemhow much is mined in a systemhow many and types of npcs are killed in a systemhow much is manufactured in a systemhow much is researched in a system blueprintshow much is sold in a systemthe numbertypevalue of ships destroyed in a systemthe alignmentorientation of nearby systemsall of the above will tally to a total for each competing alliance in that system over a certain time frame which i am proposing is 1 week in lengthwho wins influence control isov of the system is determined by adding all the influence points gained by each alliance that has had activity in the system for that week this is the base influence point number bipn then nearby system boosting nsb bonuses are applied see below the winner must have a minimum margin of 20 greater than the second placed alliance otherwise the system officially becomes contested how to calculate influence points on game itemsthis should be calculated once by ccp and just like manufacturing an items influence point value should be related to its material inputs and possibly a small percentage multiplier for faction t2 and t3 variations once calculated the items influence value need not be changed unless an item is rebalancedinfluence points more detailstructures typesizenumberownership is occupancyeach structure in space is worth a certain number of influence points 10 of which are added to the alliance influence point tally every hour the largermore expensive the structure the more points it earns this ensures that long term structure holding is rewardednaturally more structures means more points which should in theory mean more local activity to support them fuel transport usage etcspecial  new structure territory claim unit v2 tcuin the isov systemthe tcu gains all the functions of an ihubthe tcu and can be placed in any system the tcu boosts the influence points generated in the system by 30 for the relative alliance the tcu will only boost when a monthly 28 day payment is made into it having the new type of tcu in a system does not ensure system ownership howeveronly one tcu per alliance can be placed in a systemthe maximum number of tcus that any alliance can deploy is limited to a certain number like 20 this should ensure a more level playing field between alliances however this does not prohibit alliances working together to form more powerful groups or the influence domino effect occuring UFFFD see below isov dominoesminingmining will also be awarded influence points which is determined by the volume in m3 of ore mined in a systemnpc killseach npc type will be awarded an influence point value based on the ship type and a difficulty multiplier and will be awarded to the alliance that killed themmanufacturingresearch  bposbpcs etceach item in eve has an influence points value every time an item is manufacturedresearchedcopied influence points are allocated to the respective alliances weekly influence point tallysaleseach item in eve has an influence points value whenever an item is sold the influence points associated with that item will be added to the respective alliances influence point weekly tally to reduce the chance of item trade influence boosting manipulationUFFFD ie selling items back and forth repeatedly several times between two different entities to artificially drive up influence points earned an item will only generate points on the initial sale and on the following 2 trades of it after that point no more influence points will be generateddestroyed shipsstructuresitems pew pewas each item in eve has influence points associated with it whenever an item is destroyed then the alliance that scored the final blow will be awarded the total influence points for that killspecial note influence points will not be awarded for items owned by an alliance which are destroyed by that same allianceplease continue to next post
proposal  part 2nearby systems boosting nsbUFFFDwhat is happening next doorUFFFD has always influenced things eve shouldnt be any different we will call this nearby system boosting nsb for shortat the end of the 7 day time period all the influence points are added up for the alliances competing in a system this is the base influence point number bipnalliances competing in the solar system will have 20 of the bipn for all systems 1 system away added to their total assuming the alliance also has influence points generated in those systemsthen solar systems 2 systems away will have 10 of the bipn added to the tally once again assuming the alliance also has influence points generated in those systemsthis final influence total for competing alliances in a system determines the isov ownership for the next weeknote if there is more than one way to get to a nearby system the shortest number of jumps is used to consider if its a system that is one two or more systems awaywhat happens to the entosis linkit survives by allowing small numbers of attackers to disable structure functions for 24 hours potentially causing major disruption to things like production and hence influence point generation structure functions can also be destroyed by typical grinding when a station function goes into reinforce mode then the 24 hours of the reinforce mode is also the 24 hours of disruption to that functioncan the entosis link still flip a station yes but only once all the functions of a station have been disableddestroyed once the station has exited its reinforced timer without being fixed it will enter freeport mode and no longer be owned by anyone it can however be taken over from freeport mode by the existing system owner or the original owner simply by fueling it UFFFD its up for grabs after fueling it then the rest of the station functions will become available to the new system this allows large station structures that were once owned by others to forcefully change hands naturally fighting for ones station repairingrestarting reinforced functions and station is naturally the way to stop a station being piratedthis is also a way for an alliance to take over abandoned structuresexpected game play from isov changesinfluence will be amplified and spread greatly within clusters of nearby cross connected systems conversely a bridgechain of systems will be more susceptible to influence changes this will create islandscastles of power based around a central system that has the greatest influence reflected by its greater occupancy use development and fighting abilityouter regions  borderlands between isov holders may fall to those who do not even hold a tcu in that system domino effect and influence in action this effect may also allow an alliance to hold more systems than the number of tcus it is allowed to deployguerrilla warfare to risestructures can be deployed anywhere in your territory or others this also means structures intruding on your territory is naturally fair game to be attacked by either disabling functions on the the structure andor by destroying its functions and lastly the structure itself you might consider the next system over as your territory too have at it pew pewlarge scale engagementslarge fleets comprising several alliances in a power block will naturally still occur potentially leaving huge damage in their wake will the battles make them the ultimate pinnacle generating so many influence points that the devastated system becomes the attackers new province or will those regions rebuild gain back control then fight back to show the intruders who is bossby stealthindustrial power is not just in the ships built and isk earned but by the reputation and influence generated how can one not watch in awe as 50 dreadnoughts roll off the production line under isov it is possible that industrial supremacy could flip system ownership as easily as a big fleet battle or like modern corporations asserting their influence around the world today naturally industry and large fleet pew pew go together like peas in a pod under isov they are now two equal peas planting a flagand yet isov does not stop small alliances from gaining a foothold on the edges of a partners space or in the void that a contested system might create or along one of the stringy star system paths linking great power houses together flip UFFFD flop systemsa flipflop system might also arise on the edges of two or more power blocks these may simply flipflop between the two or more neighbouring alliance isov holders this can naturally be stopped by an alliance occupying the system and putting its own stamp on itviking roamingthis is where a pvp fleet causes so much damage in a system that they win isov for seven days and taxes the residents for the privileged of being in their new province damn you vikingsalso something for ccp ccp dont be worried that tcus are limited and that some systems may not even have a tcu in it be content that some systems especially contested ones could have several tcus in it the overall tcu count could in fact be more than todaythe benefits of isov ownershipwhen an alliance has isov of a system then a global tax rate will be applied by that alliance to all transactions pi etc across all systems that the alliance has isov control over this can be particularly profitable in a system that has multiple alliances vying for control of itlastly the devil is in the details the above is simply an overview of a general direction and mechanic that i believe will suit everyone in eve including ccpi will be sending it to ccp the forum and several csms to nut out if this is indeed something that can work for allcheerscorevamore bolmara
given that theyve just revamped sov which i presume took a lot of man hours just how likely on a scale of 1 to 10 do you think it is that theyll now want to add  remove  change a whole bunch of stuff
hi rootccp has in the past retracted features that it believed was not being used or not in the spirit of what was intendedmy suggestions build upon most of what they have done re the entosis link attacks which for the most part have been left in place in this proposal so development man hours are not being wastedi believe ccp will look at any idea that enhances gameplay for eve residents so assuming they believe and feedback here believes that the changes are worthwhile then i think they have a good chance of going aheadcheerscore
i rather like the idea though i think they should still make sure theres a reason to go marauding around other than the loot from the ships you destroyobviously it would have to be a lesser one but something to pillage for isk perhaps expansion on ess
still support this idea from the shadows with the pos overhaul on the table more discussion about how this will work with the new sov and structure system is needed perhaps a strait up entosis link bonus like cycle time reduction probably to powerful whatever happens something like this would be a lot of fun to play with id like to see it come with the addition of many more mobile structures that have more short burst bonuses this ship may be able to see mobile micro jump units have a larger tactical use in any engagementno matter what ccp decides to do i just wanted to say that i still support this great ideaps i know necroed the  out of this but it was worth it 
hi thanatoslook at the viking roaming side effect seems to be a decent isk earner for a week of heavy pillaging 
influence by said activities looks logical butlets say i want to take somebodys sov and live there what i actually should do step by stepmining ratting trading etc imposible in hostile system so i need to shoot structures first and this is basically dominion soventosis concept in like it is now is boring and overpoweredso what i like as a result of your proposition add more activities to boost system defense not only 3 indexes influence on nearby systemsso you need to thing more about how it will actually workas a simple solution to current sov system i can propose if system is surrounded by systems which have the same claim then it is invulnurable to any attackso you will need to start attack from alliance borders with other alliance or hilow sec you can still take uncontested systems one by one trolling is also possible but you cant put the whole region on fire in 1 day like in provi nowedit and the last one see alliance logo on map is cool but in fact thats all that we have from holding sov bridges nerfed by phoebe and not every player build supercaps so we need some benefits for every pilot in alliance that hold sov
hi josefto answer your questionsstep by step to overtake a system which can be done in a variety of ways one would launch attacks into system to disabledestroy structures destroydisable production facilities disrupt supply lines which both stops sales and gives you more influence points via the kill build up influence in surrounding systems  this has a flow through effect install your own structures in system yes it can be done in hostile systems attack and destroy enemy ships destroydisable the enemies tcu rat in the system mine in the system if possible manufactureresearchsales in the system this would be a later step as hostile forces are forced backso there is no point by point way to do it as it will be a combination of things though not necessarily every point abovei have left the entosis link in the proposal as a way to disable functions which can also be attacked in a traditional way as well on structures and to keep ccps coding investment in the entosis based system it is just another way in my proposal of attacking someone you will notice that in my proposal one must disable all structure functions by entosis before the structure can be attacked with it  perhaps the structure should be ground down as per traditional sov  so this is something that can be looked atas the proposal outlines several ways that influence points are generated each of which could be conceivedshown into an index to make things easier to understandthe above shows how it works there are no hard and fast step by step rules on how one would take over a system  that will be up to how the attacker wants to do it it is an extremely flexible system in that respect and no a system probably cant be taken over in a single day unless perhaps every enemy structure and huge numbers of pilot and freighter kills occurred in the day before the isov calculation is made and the system is possibly surrounded by your systems then it could conceivably flip in a day but generally a system wont flip in single a day note putting a whole systemregion on fire in a day does not have anything to do with sov in this proposal except that it would generate lots of influence points  whether thats enough to effect the isov standings for that 7 day period is another mattersecond note this proposal is for nullsec onlylastly i dont know what you are talking about bridgessupercaps etc as it has little to do with my proposalcheerscore
grats on making csmnow that you are csm are you allowed to continue with this petition in the form of collective bargainingor is this suddenly against your nda  csm contractyou posted this petition at 731 and gorga was kicked out on 804perfect timing 
1 people can already buy sp on the character bazaar this whole argument is null and void2 100 mill sp doesnt make this game anymore fun it will actually make you hate the game more
first lolthis is hilarious but valid eve online is technically illegal in many usa states because of new anti cyber bully lawslol again
all you want is fairness and transparency right
i had an idea for enriching the eve lore today ok so we all know the jovians are ccp well until they give us another story that is what i believe well what if they release a story that the jovians ascended somehow and have become like gods then change all the ccp interaction stuff to jovian something or other replace support tickets with prayers or something of the like know what i mean put ccp into the story we all have to deal with ccp at some point while playing eve so why not include them in the larger story when you have to make a support ticket it really takes you out of the game there should be no reason the eve immersion should ever be broken by anything ingame we could create an entire mythos surrounding the deified jovians ccp and how they have infinite power to change anything in new eden if it is willed and prayed requested for by enough pilots it would be like mt olympus or the norse version asgard think of how cool that would be each csm would be a representative of the gods and each gm would be a god there could be massive back stories created and eve would become a much more story based rpg story is everything to me in video games and im impressed with many of the changes ccp has made recently i would love for some money and time to be thrown toward this endeavor isk perhaps id be willing to spin a tale with a team and see what ccp thinks ccp this is your chance to become gods going to work each day could be your game while we pilots play ours
what
it seems that someone hit the battle a little hard and really did find religion at the bottom of it or rather a desire for it at the very least
i am not a religious person at all but i think it is a better option than sending a support ticket into a company in iceland it doesnt have to be faith really look at the thor movies those gods are real no faith required
all of nullsec should become wormholesremove sov
uaxdeath is now a csm i seriously doubt he is allowed to continue managing a petition against ccp decisions
1just make supers only flyable within sov plus no jump fatigue rebuff supersyou can only make supers in sov you should only be able to fly supers in sovi know ccp likes to make things complicated so here is a more complex idea2if your pilot has been in an alliance or coalition that held sov with other corpsalliances that held sov in the last 90 days the pilot cannot use supers once they leave the alliance  coalition they will get 90 days of sov fatiguepilots that have not been members of corps with blue alliancescorps within the last 90 days and no sov fatigue can pilot supers and make supersmake supers incredible again so small corps can project a large amount of power within a small foot printsuper pilots will be happy by giving back more functionality to the supers and add value to small corps in nullsecmaking new players dream of piloting supers valid againpsmaybe i should have called it alliance and coalition fatigue
is this because of uaxdeaths petition posted on 731gorga is publicly kicked on 804interesting
it was nothing to do with it
ideally learning implants will die and this feature can be integrated into the game with no reservations if not perhaps a bonus could be applied like 75 jump clone delay reduction when changing clones in systemstation
i sort of agree with thisremove implants  remove podding make clone jumping from anywhere possible instantly destroying the ship you are in and implantsmake the button very easy to hit accidentally generate lots of plexing for ccp
i am going to need to push for my old damage stacking penalty i wrote up years ago incentive to split fire over press f1 still can blob fire but total damage is less than if spread etc etc squad on squad fight need ewar etc
nothing is more annoying than firing off a salvo of these smart missiles only instead of them going slamming into a dangerous serpentis space pirate they blow up the nearest space brothel while this does wonders for space property prices it is a bit silly that they prioritise buildings over flashy red things  i know theyre supposed to target the nearest thing but this is ridiculous perhaps some balancing somewhere might be nice
are you serious no one needs your input crybaby social justice warriors make me sick hall monitor
ok so i think this would add a bit of fun to the procedure of complaining to ccp about bugs or making suggestions to ccp about possible game changes you can not deny the similarity between our interaction with ccp and how a ppl have historically asked dieties for help i think it would add a never before seen depth to the game not really a religion at all since our gods ccp are provably real i block anyone that tells me about the rules of this forum or suggest to me how i should speak
jesus you nullbears whine more than even the hardiest dodixieite adapt or die htfu etc etc
problem fozziesov in its current state critically reduces chances for large scale fights fights that significantly separate eve online from its competitorsfalse narrative the large scale fights you speak of center around legacy tactics  capital blops etc the new mechanic levels this playing field by allowing guerrilla style tactics to be an effective tool by effective tool i mean1 a means in which an opponent can gather intel by measuring your response 2 requires the sov holder to defend what they desire to keep and prioritize sov holdings3 requires any group who is determined to hold sov that they have ability to demonstrate force projection in relation to current or desired sov holdingsand much moregone are the days of holding sov under the threat of response umbrella if anything you will have a fight the scale depends upon your willingness to risk ships or sov that also means you will no longer be able to make the statement to your prospective renters that the area is safe nothing is safe period really by your own logic that would also mean that low sp members of code flying catalysts are harassing miners and haulers in hi sec your logic also demands that they should have to fly something other than a cheap destroyers in order to gank in hi secthis whole petition nonsense is without merit for years and years players have claimed null is broke the fact is that those players whining about the new sov are nothing more than a bunch of elitist adolescents who stomp their feet and throw tantrums when things dont go according to their liking adapt or leavecivil discourse is uniquely human after all when is the last time a pride of lions and a herd of water buffalo negotiated sov over a watering hole never someone either gets their ass kicked or eaten at the end of the day someone holds sov
and they can have my eve when they pry my keyboard from my cold dead handsnot that hard to ignore insignificance it just comes natural no reallycivil discourse is uniquely human after all when is the last time a pride of lions and a herd of water buffalo negotiated sov over a watering hole never someone either gets their ass kicked or eaten at the end of the day someone holds sov
i would like to purchase 5 of whatever it is youre smoking
it doesnt contraven the nda in anyway its laughably a wrongheaded attempt from a buggy whip manufacturer to ban automobiles but its still a perfectly legitimate action for any eve player csm or otherwise to make a case for a change they want
lolwut of course he is it is basically the ccpfacing part of the job to do this
first i want to thank all the sitting csm members for signing up to be the change that you are fighting to see eve is full of armchair quarterbacks and actually participating in the leadership of any decision making process is a lot of hard work i guess i want to issue the same challenge to all the nay sayers that are constantly saying that eve is dying i personally have played this game since 2008 and i still feel good about it change of which fossie sov represents is always a tough road while not perfect i caution that the angst may be in large part due to a loss of priviledge regardless many others who live null day to day will expound on what real meaningful changes ccp will need to impliment but can we as players take a more positive outlook towards the various solutions that are game is experiencing this brings me back to my original point we need to be the change that we want to see many complain that numbers are down or have unsubbed in protest to make a point but that doesnt help make eve better no game is perfect and eve is reflective of that realityim just tired of the negative mindset thats becoming more and more pronounced we cant say hey eve is broken and then when change is a attempted throw darts at the attempts to make it better well we can but that lacks a sense of ownership that i feel is needed at this juncture of our games history while i dont agree with a lot of things in eve  i also know that my experience with this incredible game isnt determined by others my ships course and its journey are my responsility alone lets at least be positiveso thankyou csm keep fighting the good fight and i pledge to keep my outlook positive
