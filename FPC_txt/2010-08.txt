oh yes please no more proclaiming to be excellent without actually defining what excellence is
absolutely sure i want to see incarna for a laugh and sut could be incredible but if the game is in its current state when those go live the players that come for those new features will be dusgusted with the current state of affairs and not stay while those of us currently here keep leavingedited for spelling
be honest people the very word excellence coming out of ccps mouth sound mind boggling we dont expect true excellence and ccp is very certainly not capable of providing itall we want is that core aspects of eve dont get completely abandoned for at least next two years and that bugs and balance problems both trivial and severe have people working on them and real solutions in the pipe
more excellence supported

right onccp should really be smarter about third party appsjust think how much dev time would it take to make evemon or evecentralall you have to do is give people tools and they make all this stuff for freeif only the ui were this way say what you will about wow you cant argue that the quantity and quality of the playerdeveloped ui mods for that game are anything short of incredibleour players are smarter i bet they could come up with way better stuff if you worked on opening up the code more
while highsec shouldnt be completely safe i do agree that suicide ganks needs a gimp to bring its profitability back down in line with other professions you can potentially earn billions of isk for a few minutes of work and cheap gankboat thats insured the reward is far too huge for so little work and no risk for the ganker in insured cheapboat the riskworkload vs reward ratio is off
i think you forget to actually remove the troll content adida hint the whole post
know who else can potentially earn billions of isk for a few minutes of work only without any risk scammers and thats an allowed mechanic in eve just like suicide ganking only no isk lost and no risk required and this reward doesnt come out of nowhereppl have to be stupid enough to get caught in the right place at the right time under the right conditions to be suicide ganked while a scam can be done anywhere anytime get some perspective before u post
meh this crap againyou napsecers wanna pull your wang out any time someone with a 3day old account suggests highsec should be safer and then argue to bluefaces on both sides about how the other is ruining the game or doesnt get evetake your own advice and stop taking the game so seriouslyps ambivalent at best about the topic dont care not supporting or refuting
heh i tell you yet again ive never been suicide ganked on misssion but i do know many instances and want to prevent that possibility and there is no one how great smart as he could be can escape a planned professional suicide gank if they want you  they will get you for sure and they will want you if youre flying something decent they can strip for themselves for no penalty at all so thats it i removed everything valuable from my paladin except hull and t2 rigs heh and replaced it with t2 junk very funny crap it became and i just wonder why the developers made all those faction and complex mods in game if we shouldnt use them at all because of continuous suicide gank fest the progress is stopped and theres no real point in game
they created it for the people who have the ballz to dock out with them and use them even them said they never wanted the highsec to be perfectly securecriminal do have penalty by the way that why they dont kill anything that move in highsec but only rich people with really juicy thing youre arguing that they should be safe the dev and lot of player said it already they dont want you to be safe they want you dying your idea have been posted many time now if the devlopper really wanted for you to be safe they would have done it already and you know some of us love to have risk even in high sec i for one love the suicide ganker on gate making stupid trader miserable while they let me pass because of my tank just play another game if you dont want any risk
i made around a bill in a plex this morning and it was perfectly safe since ive run it before and it was in alliance space the risk was essentially zero and there was no potential about the reward you get 100m in bounty 220m in overseer effects and an xtype module every time too less than an hour from undocking to redockingso yeah now weve disposed of that silly argument the suicide ganker can also potentially get nothing how much he gets is entirely up to other players no guaranteed reward whatsoever if theyre careless with incredibly valuable cargo then its not that suicide ganking is inherently too easy its that the victims are too foolhardyall it takes for suicide ganking to be wiped out overnight is for fools to stop afk hauling valuable cargo in untanked ships got a freighter full of tritanium by all means afk autopilot that noone is gonna bother moving the deadspace fittings for your shiny new nightmare the for the love of god use a supertanked drake or a covops or something and at least try and make it difficultmove your pricey stuff around in something like this unless someone cares enough to get an organised fleet of 20 or so tempests you can just laugh off any gankers its cheap toodrake move medamage control iipower diagnostic system iipower diagnostic system iipower diagnostic system iilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iilarge shield extender iiinvulnerability field iiinvulnerability field iiphoton scattering field iiimproved cloaking device iiempty high slotempty high slotempty high slotempty high slotempty high slotempty high slotempty high slotmedium core defence field extender imedium core defence field extender imedium core defence field extender i163k ehp enough cargo to move the fittings for the faction bs of your choice from jita to whichever misison hub you use unless youre moving estamel class stuff noones going to bother
ah so theyre for people with a great desire to get their own ballz to be separated from themselves interesting indeedive heard about people with such a masochistic perversion but there is a whole lot of space for them in lowsecs where they can be raed 247 as they wish
1 who said they had to actually be in the alliance or corp blue standings r sufficient enough2 wanna elaborate on this especially since this is supposed to be an actual proposal in the assembly hall not some halfassed idea in features and ideas3 if by the ppl u cant account for u mean every pirate whos blue to an major alliance then thats an awful lot of pirates who r immune to this system even with no blob4 this is exactly what the trolling is foru ask for a decent argument yet your own argument regarding the systems viability outside of high sec consist of cant stop them from abusing the system and5 when u say to give ppl more credit u do the exact opposite for the pirates by vastly underestimating them6 and what difference does it make to give a worthless incentive to spend your entire subscription time hunting down one person with all that effort get realno one would find that fun unless 1 the target committed a crime much more serious than generating kill rights andor 2 the hunters have no reallife obligations requiring their time7 refer back to 4 and 58 much like how ure immune to it thx to your blob so it wouldnt interfere with your game or theirs if thats supposed to be some sort of bribe to try to silence the opposition not gonna happenso basically its credible to offer slightly more isk for ppl to stop shooting whoever they want and instead go on a subscriptionconsuming wild goose chase or a blob trap that isnt even a worthwhile income or fun for its risk and effort to begin with wowthis is no different than the fail boost low sec proposals that get spammed in the assembly hall ever came across a pirate who set a high bounty on himself think he just put it there 5 seconds ago no hes had it there for a long time because he knows wtf hes doing its not that im not giving the bounty hunters enough creditits u thats not giving the pirates enough credit

to the people who seem to love pulling statistics and game mechanics out of their asses ecm is chance based  attacking ecm module strength  defending ships sensor strengtheach module does an individual calculation not total strength of all mods as in per modany time the numerator attacking ecm str is lower than the denominator defending ship sensor str it converts into a percentage chance such as 13 or a 33 chance to jam eccm modules are active modules that increase your ships sensor strength by 96 this means that in order to permajam the ratio needs to be 11 or 11 if you like fractions currently the highest jam strength is a falcons of around 15 and is therefore physically impossible to truly permajam a battleship with a strength of 22 1522example strengths  all skills lvl 5base multispec 31 strengthbase racial jammer strength 46 racial strength15 all othersscorpion 68 multi  10334 racialfalcon 97 multi  14648 racialblackbird 66 multi  9933 racialexample sensor strengths defense  all skills lvl 5titan  avatar 200dreadnaught  moros 44bs  raven 22bs  megathron 21bc  drake 19cruiser  maller 14inty  taranis 9recon  falcon 28example  falcon w racial jammer 148 vs drake 19 148  19  0778 or 778 chance to jam per module applied on targetops statement at worst case  scorpion w racial 103 vs bs 22  22 eccm  22 eccm103  66  015606 or 15606 chance to jam per modulebased upon math the op is either confused a horrible liar or a troll
isnt it obvious they didnt turn their eccm onanyways u need to take into account the rigs and the skills at lvl 5 too in your calculationsas for nerfing it i recall so many times when a single eccm will stop a logistics from being jammed stop ing about bad luckthis is eve htfu
big thumps down champ i dont know how many pvp engagements you been in with less the 6 people in it in low sec or hight sec you norm dont see that many sniper fitted ships so you looking at close range a mega for on max range is about 6km high dps raven 7km torp fitted geddon 20km and a ac fitted temp 11km the temp beaning the one to look out for coz they have some crazy fall of ranges so you you wont have much of a problem with your scorpion and for the sniper hacs i have never seen any of them fitted the really only cruisers that have 20 ss and over are the faction ones and recon ships so thumbs up to this post and fix ecm or the ecm ships lest see more shooting and less dead ships in space d
and neuts on a curse are not owerpowered please stay away for nerfing the only thing caldari are good at
nothing ruins pvp faster than ecm 2 weeks ago i was in a double eccm ishtar 75 sensor strength and was jammed with ease by a falcon for two cycles straight away was in an eccm harb the other day jammed by ecm drones for the whole fight 3 or 4 minutes solid so these days i just abuse falcons and ecm as often as i can in the hopes others will complain about it and get it nerfed its long overdue a mega nerf
i think the the principle of this game mechanic itself is badecmed pilots can do nearly nothing but watching their shipgang being meltedthis means a lot of frustration much more than just being poppedjust look at similar mechanics in other games like the sandman in team fortress 2 or the stun lock in the mmorpgwhomustnotbenamed it always lead to dramaand making it chance based only makes it worse since although most of the engagements will happen roughly as the probabilities would let you expect there will always be a few where the ecm ship will perform exceptionally well or bad and guess what  its these few exceptional engagements players will remember and whine aboutchanging ecm to something new would need a lot of of work and balancing and thus wont happen anytime soon if ever but the the chance based system leading to ridiculous situations probably could and is imho the way to go for a shortterm fix
the obvious answer is to improve tracking disruptors and remote sensor damps
fix it naow and im not even kiddingi have to flip the scanning plane around every time the signature is below the centerline just so i can see the probe widgets
back story i was recently robbed by an in corp thief and once i started to investigate how i the end user or my ceo can monitor what happened to the corp assets there i stumbled in a dead end issue ccp developed the in game corp management design so that a thief has all the advantages to steal corp property once he reaches some sort of access privileges or in worst case of shared corp hangars the option to clear corps assets without trace back to him while the victim of such thievery and the ceo stays without the option to prevent it even in case of a single man being given the privilege to manage corp assets and some asset disappear the ceo has no proof that the privileged person took it as no record can be brought as a factin the case as i described i turned to ccps gm via a petition as i had no suspicion that some one just came and took my items 2 bil worth of ships been stolen and i claimed that the items were probably lost in the recent database issues gm started an investigation about some items that i have lost he informed me that the items are not lost but someone just claimed the assets from the shared hangar on the request to see the log that it was indeed another user and not a server glitch i again found myself in dead end the gm refused to disclose the other users actions as by ccps policy and eula neither was he able to face me with any fact that the item was not lost in the database glitcheven when i claimed that this is a flaw in the game design that me as a end user cant track to what happened to the lost item was it really taken by other user or was it deleted the gm just leaves you in doubtso after i started wondering around the web to find similar stories and as it seems that the game has dis balance in the corp management and the tools provided in game the gm is able to track where and what happened to an item while the ceo cant nor any other official figure in corp as so it gives all the advantages to the thief and load of frustration to the managers and the victim the victim cant retaliate to the act of in corp thievery nor the managers have the tools to track and remove the thieves solution add to the corp hangars changes log no need for a too much long log a 7 days in my opinion is enough so that an official figure ceo security officer can access and see who took what by so giving factual evidence to the end users of what happened to their assets this will prevent frustration from the victims and will warn the thief that if he be found stealing he can be punished for thatanother fun idea that i thought is to make a new skill in corp management access log decryption so if you got level 1 it will take you about 5 days to decrypt the log find out who took what and then find the thief at level 5 it will take 24h to decrypt this means less time for the thief to run away with stolen goods the cons of this solution is more items to process on server side but as it looks that those records already there as the gms can access it
i was about to post saying your throwing a fit over corp theft but then i see your just complaining about the lack of the whowhat and not necessarily the thefttheft is normal in this game but i for one would like a log book for any corporation hanger stationoutpostpossput it into api so it can be tracked by apps like evehq
corp and alliance roles and permissions need a total revampthis would be a good part of that
3 of the 4 have major issues and the last one could still use a buff their dsp is terrible their range is hampered because they cant fit the highest teir lr guns their alpha is weak their hit points are less than most of the teir 4 frigate fits explain to me how this is wrong
the problem with destroyers is that the niche theyre supposed to fill is one that nobody really needs  mediocre dps from long range with an alphastrike which used to be credible but artillery thrasher asideceased to matter since the hitpoint boost in revelationsfor all destroyersremove the 25 rof penaltyremove 50 optimal bonus replace with more appropriate racial optionsremove 2 highslots and 2 turret hardpoints add 1 midslot and 1 lowslotreduce sig radius to around 6070m2increase base shield hitpoints for cormorantthrasher and base armour hitpoints for coercercatalyst to around 900beyond that the individual hulls need some tweaking to properly work with their primary weapon system but this would be a start
no look at factionnal warfare they are antifrigate and are really efficient at it you just dont know how to fly them if you complain or want to fly them in a situation they arent created for
just because i can convert the time doesnt mean i want to all the time i even setup my comps clock to show me eve time right beside my time but that doesnt mean i like to do the math
who cares about walking in stations scrap incrapai mean incarna and get back to what this game is aboutinternet spaceshipsthat is all

nopick on people who want to fight or better yet go somewhere like lowsec or 00 where war decs dont mean crap
youre wardeccing the corp not the actual players thus the way the game works deal with itnot supported
if you make noobies targets of constant hazing that they cant get away from they wont renew their subscriptions ccp is running a business mouths to feed and bills to pay
think twice before you wardecnot supportedwant targets low sec roams something i recently discovered to be quite fun
gb2wowkthxbaialso post with your mainfixed for you
not supportedpeople have a right to personally evade wars with other players if you wardec a corp where the majority of the players leave it afterwards then clearly you have choosen to wardec a corp that is not in the constitution of fighting back also the statement that eve is a pvp game is not entirely correct eve is a sandbox style universe simulator that covers many aspects including pve and pvp
they can pay extortion money or hire mercs if the dont want to fight instead they usually corp hop and get npcs concord to protect them for free while they amass isk with almost no risk in high sec
so you wardec a corp and people leave the corp too bad you wardecced a corp not a player if you want to kill a specific player you can kill them regardless of if you are at war or not any ship will pop if you bring a few friends to suicide gank them even their nice faction bs or marauder will go down to a coordinated gank however you appear unwilling to consider options like that as it would require effort and coordination it seems you arent necessarily looking for fights as much as cheap kills
i know i do this a lot it takes only three or four artillery bss to kill a kronos
and because high sec is less risky it is that all the valuable ore and rats are in lowsec and nullsec and wspacepeople sacrifice part of their income for more security seems perectly balancedyour motivation howerver is completly unbalanced where is your risk when u wardec defenseless carebare corps  why dont you wardec pvp oriantated corps  afraid you might loose against an even enemy 
a simpler thing would be to give a cooldown time for any player to join a corporation except for npcafter disbanding from one thats wardecced this prevents using shell corps to avoid wardecs while letting people who want to opt out a safe haven if you disband corp due to a wardec there should be some penalty but not thatotherwise people will just play other games or use alts instead
been saying this for 5 years now persistent flags per corp memberwholly supported
thisand this
theres a popular mmo that has pve and pvp realms
yes and so as eve has both pvp and pve contentnot supported
eve has pve and pvp content therefore people should be able to corp hop to avoid wardecs makes absolutely no sense reread your post because youre essentially arguing that the existence of pve content proves that people should be able to optout of wardecs instead of paying mercs paying extortion or fighting
what you are missing is that the peopble that can hop to avoid wardecs already do pay a price for this ability the immense profitability difference between highsec and lowsec00wspace there is no reason why ontop of that they should have to pay another price in form of paying mercs etc
ill bitehighsec is more profitable for most players excluding people who can solo sanctums miners in nullsec systems where very few neutrals roam and a few other players like ones who can safely rat in npc sov or good truesec 00 than lowsec nullsec or wspace because theres almost zero risk sure you might make more per hour ratting in good truesec but you also have to defend that space which takes time and isk if you lose your ship and youre usually making next to nothing while flying in defensive fleets youll also lose a ratting ship every so often even if you watch localthe absence of actually having to spend time defending yourself in highsec makes it more profitable for most players than lowsec nullsec or wspace
you said it yourself its a tradeoff between higher security and more profit wether or not highsec or 00 is more profitable in the long run is very individual as per player if you know alot of people are in a bigger corpalliance it is more profitable to be in lowsec00 in the long run if you play mostly solo then high sec is more profitable in the long run
im not against pvp by any means just look me up on bca wardec is against a corporation by forcing members to leave the corporation youve won people can still end up playing this game if they are completely outclassed and outgunned by leaving their corporationthe comments about lowsec and nullsec are not about consensual pvp areas so much as its a place you can go and shoot them anyways on the topic of pvp and pve realms you can still shoot anyone in highsec without a wardec  just look at hulkageddonin the end  when youve completely outgunned and outclassed your opponent  he can retreat to relative safety in highsec away from the corporation he may have known and loved but continue to play the game in some capacity he may not have the isk to pay you or mercsyouve won imo take your victory and move on to find someone who wants to actually shoot back if that is your goal
slimy you know that most of the wardec insec are not monetary in mindmost of them will accept no money and just want to kill people who cant fight back for the lulzhell i cant count anymore the number of time corporation with close to nothing got wardec without reason because they offered targetyou want to remove the only means to people for playing simply because you want thing more easy while you already have an option to kill the one who really worth it worse you would not achieve your end anyway because they would simply stay in a npc corp if is was not because of that i would be actually for it because rich carebear are not the only one who abuse that option i helped a corp who got wardec and when the attacker saw us coming what they did  they hided in a npc corp they only wanted easy target to ransom not real fight
the ingame calendar is a good tool and i thank ccp for implementing it however there is the problem that it shows monday as the leftmost column and sunday as the rightmost column i realize that this is the standard in some countries but in other countries most notably the united states calendars start with sunday and end with saturday which makes the eve online ingame calendar somewhat disorientingif an option could be included to let the user specify if sunday should be the leftmost column instead of monday then it would be appreciated thank you
sunday is part of the weekend so having the week start on that day is incredibly dumbsupported though as its being requested as an option and not a change forced on everyone
actually for some groups and i have no idea which sunday is the first day of the week and not part of the weekenda quick google with give the answers
good tweak suggestion like it zach
supported eve needs some more content that is only in lowsec theres very few targets there as it is lowsec pirates spend most of their time fighting each other
in order to familiarize yourself with the subject please check out this threadthanks in advance for your support
create a new mid slot weapon that has limited ammo and only about 5km rangemaybe even have powercpu requirements so only cruiser or larger ships can carry itthat when fired at another ship allows the user of the weapon to track the ship anywhere in eve if the victim has high enough electronics upgrades skills they will be notified that their ship is being tracked if the fleet commander has high enough electronic upgrade skills they will be notified of the player that has been tracked that is in their fleet once a ship is hit with one of these tracking systems the only way to remove it will be to dock up if they were not notified during flight that they were being tracked due to to low of electronics skills then they would be notified once they dock up
1 find locater agent2 get scan prober if said target is not docked uplogged off3 4 profit
im just thinking along the lines that this is something that would come about in any universe this isnt for tracking people before an engagement such as using locater agents it would put a new angle to warfare maybe your entire purpose of attacking someone wouldnt be to destroy them but to track them so a larger force can come in and finish the job it makes perfect sense to me i think youve been reading to much slashdotprofit
learn to use the tools you have kidstop making stupidfoolish game breaking ideasyoull live longer
you already have the ability to track a target simply zoom out the camera watch where the target goes guesstimate where the target warped off to go after himher alternatively send fast tackle to intercepthaving a warp disruptorscrambler so the target doesnt escape in the first place also helps too
who doesnt know thisyou guys dont get it just because something is a new idea that changes how the game could be played does not make it break the game say youre in a wh and they warp to a safe spot and cloak up say they are in a massive fleet and you want to know where that fleet is without having neutrals sitting cloaked in every system just to do it i hate to break it to you guys but just because something new is introduced into the game that would cause you to play the game differently or consider what ifdoes not mean it breaks the gameit just upsets your status quo if thats the mindset then whats the point in making any suggestions at all no room for change in your world
stop coming up with excuses for your short comingsyou obviously havent been playing eve very long or youd understand that your idea is in fact game breakingthere are many many tactics involved in tracking down targets ive used them myself and ive also used countertactics for hidinggiving someone the power to know the exact note the quotes location of any one pilot in the game by firing off a shot may seem like a great idea to you but you need to put that idea in the hands of the worst possible scumbag in your eyes possible and multiple that by 60000 roughly the concurrent population of eve right now on a daily basis give or take people who play this game very well use it and abuse it they bend the rules to there advantage and make it work for them your tool will be exploited abused and utterly made to be used by someone else in any fashion other than what you wanted it forif you have any amount of sanity or intelligence in thinking things through youd see your idea is in fact quite utterly horridin short we already have what we need the game is working as intended dont like it toughnow if you dont understand any of what i just saidthis is eve online not iwin online
is it possible to send a email a few days before someones account expiredthanks
this would help alot please change this
i dont plex but this makes way too much sense
way too easy for ccp
let us drag and drop from acess customs office window so i need to have one less window open instead of opening the acess hangar
it stands for remote repairing basically you target a friendly and repair them the exequor and osprey are the two t1 rr support cruisers and it doesnt take that many skills to get into one and fit it properly takes about a week or two tops im going to stop your right there because i know exactly what youre implying with thisfirst off skill points do not define the player they do help you achieve your goals and give you versatility but they do not make your character what it issecond there is a total of 5 levels for every skill and only a select number of skills are applied while in any one shipthis means that if you train up and specialize in frigates a process that takes a little over a month getting most of the relevant skills to 4 or 5 you can just about match the character that has been playing for 3 years in a comparable ship if you specialize the only thing an older player has on you is playing experience ie tactics and more versatility in swapping to a different ship which you wont give him the chance to do because youre long gone by thenthe game is supposed to be hostile and teach people that they have to rely on things outside of the game ie not game mechanics to accomplish their goals if you can talk well be diplomatic and see if you cant find a solution to your war dec issues theres no trainable skill for that if you can command well and stratagize well put it to the test and lead your corp into battlesuch examples of people thinking outside the box are early on when i was a nub my corp was full of other newbies and maybe 1 or 2 veterans that were leading us we got a wardec and were camped in for a good amount of time our vets got tired of this consolidated everyone into one station got everyone into t1 rifters and had us undock at the same time we all died but we took down two t2 ships with us the wardec ended the next day my alt likes to wardec carebear corps we stumbled upon a newbie corp that couldnt defend itself nor pay up so to end the wardec we had the corp ceo come on to our voice comms and sing im a little teacup for 5 minutes  there is a famous case where someones very expensive ship was caught and ransomed the victim didnt have the isk to pay so he ordered a delivery pizza for one of his captors once the pizza arrived they released him
and there are plenty of corps that are well equipped to help newbies deal with little inconveniences like war decs the issue seems to be that the op joined one that isnt in a position to help him enjoy a war dec
not really the corps that are the most friendly to take newbies are often the ones that can repel a wardec the least hisec mission and indy corps not everyone wants to be funneled into rvb fw or euni the stronger corps or alliances want higher sp and usually t2 ships and bsi think they should really look at the new user experience about that i remember trying to find a corp as a newbie was really meh because of that myabe some form of mentor program or something
just an fyi its god damb unfriendly if not hostile for experienced players too the only difference is that weve mostly learned to deal with it guess howdelaying the start of the learning process helps nooneactually some people never learn to deal with it but thats a separate issue
 rras far as i know if someone rr your war target they turn red now and they still should turn red with this proposal as i said in op this proposal only apply to wardec all other mechanism stay the same if they take part in a fight then they cha
so step 1  join unprepared hisec mission and indy corpsstep 2  get slaughtered by first wardec facedstep 3  blame the systemreally my corp has a newbie who just joined us who cant fly anything other than his rifter yet he has zero wardec issues why he would laugh his ass off at the three step its not my fault change the game process i have just sarcastically i admit described its the responsibility of the individual to join a group that supports and meets the individuals longterm goals if the goal is to not be a victim of any random highsec griefer wardec asshat corporations that come along then joining the described hisec mission and indy corps might have been a less than optimal choice there are other choices the beauty of eve is its not too late  the very moment the op takes ownership of the choice and decides to do something different tomorrow heshe will start winning eve
joining or forming a corp is a statement to the world that you are capable of defending your shared interests if you arent you shouldnt join a corp like thatgroups like euni show that coordinated noobs can cause some damage or at least make wars not be much fun for their opponents either stay in an npc corp or be prepared to fight sheltering new players from the reality of eve wont help at all as eventually they will have to swim in the ocean with the sharks
your argument is same as numerous above nad nothing newmy point is they cant afford or too costly for them to swim and npc corp is not the answer
your argument is same as numerous above nad nothing newmy point is they cant afford or too costly for them to swim and npc corp is not the answeri agree that npc corps are a poor answer and i respect your desire to get out of them and stay out of them as quickly as possible more new players could use this dose of backbone understand that all of us who have given similar answer have been where you are every rich old vet was once a broke noob we understand the position youre in the first corp i joined was involved in a huge war at the time i joined my poorly fit t1 cruiser best i could fly minimal skill points and small bank account made me a minor contributor at best  but i did contribute the corp had a ship replacement system and several times i was given ships to help fight the enemy with ship replacement policies are not uncommon and they solve the problem youre facing this is one solution some empire corporations will hire mercenary corporations to solve wardec problems for them there are many merc groups out there who would be happy declare war on your attackers for a fee this is another solution what we are saying is  if your corp has not planned ahead and has no solutions to help you get through this war dec you may have joined an underprepared corp you can now decide to work with them and make your corp stronger and overcome this problem together or you can look for other corporations that are in a better position to help you deal with war decs that may happen in the future youre a podpilot all ya need are brains and backbone  not game changing safety features i do wish you luck with whichever path you follow
please create drones that can do salvaging for us
id support this idea i would even purpose a dedicated ship made by ore for it and that those drones be able to be loaded into this ship only plus it will be given bonuses for the tractor beams
didnt ccp say catagorically that this would never happen something about drones making for more lag
i support the ability to change a characters gender my reasoning is that there are many body alterations available in the eve universe as shown in the burning lifei support more role play based on facts given to us by ccp
i would like to see ftm and mtf options also i want hermaphroditeswhen you are at it i want marriage not only between male and famele but also between male and male and humans and dronesdronesex is not a sin i am serious

when i played ffxi i had to compete against harvesters for resources too did that make ffxi a pvp game no when i played it i also had to compete against people undercutting me at market sometimes by a lot and wed have price wars that make it pvp too i also had to compete directly against others for a split second chance at claiming a rare mob is it a pvp game because of thatwhat about robbing the guild bank other games do that too are they all pvp ones eve players for some odd reason extend pvp status to things which arent as for pvp itself it shouldnt be taken out or anything but its just not fun for a lot of eve subscribers its too heavily based on numbers and size and a lot of times its avoided either partially through metagaming or completely by running away or staying docked in station the last two big events in game were suiciding mining barges and uk getting disbandedi think stuff like incarna is designed to retain people who like eve but pvp simply isnt enough its smart look at aion for exampleits similar to eve in being a heavily pvp focused game with less pve and its struggling
krecian made this wonderful post explaining the different aspects of pvp in eve and then you ruin it with a fest like that way to go
oris post does a great job of exposing the conceptual and pragmatic problems with pvp fundamentalism lets look at this misplaced theology a bit more closely finnagain is right that ccp uses piracy as part of its marketing for eve ccp also incorporates darwinian struggle as a thematic arc while the prospect of battles in space draws many of us to eve it doesnt follow from this that eve is a pvpsandbox as opposed to a sandbox with pvp epic battles and piracy can take place in either kind of online universe so while it may be good marketing finnagain is taking these advertisements a tad too literally while making a basic error of reasoning what motivates this error is a dogmatic belief in pvp fundamentalism  that the essence of eve is pvp and the rest of its activities and players exist to service pvp ambitions pvp fundamentalism is often justified by claiming eve is darwinian that is hypercompetitive unfortunately for finnagain and friends this is a misunderstanding of darwinism darwin had a place for both cooperation and competition in his theory and fitness was never equated with hypercompetitivism that is spencerism and some other evolutionarily inflected political ideologies so too he placed great emphasis on the role of moral and social norms on individual and group fitness indeed he thought of prosocial behaviour as arising to promote fitness this pvp fundamentalism also leads to an overinterpretation of everything in eve being pvp krecian illustrates this with the notion that mining buy orders and salvaging are pvp by another name such overly broad interpretations are the signature mark of fundamentalist ideologies in point of fact mining trading and salvaging are as much characterized by cooperation as they are competition so too are virtually all aspects of eve corps alliances coalitions trade agreements fleets and their like would be impossible without a high degree of cooperation and prosocial norms this doesnt eliminate competition rather cooperation and competition go handinhand so from an empirical and descriptive point of view eve is still better described as a sandbox with pvp aka a cosmos does thinking about eve as a cosmos ruin the game end pvp or make eve into a singleperson rpg no will it end piracy stop griefing necessitate arenas no pvp and nonpvp elements can and do exist simultaneously the sky is not falling chicken little indeed from the looks of incarna and dust id say ccp is trending towards a fully realized cosmos perhaps for precisely the reasons ori points outdelilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
i play starcraft 2 as the zerg i build as many drones as possible and mine as many minerals as i can sometimes exceeding 12k mins in one game i dont build the fighting units because i am a moral person first and foremost
i like to think myself pretty close to the center on this debate actually the only thing i could be considered fundamentalist about nice attempt at rhetoric there using a word that conjures images of religious zealots beating on heretics is the idea that you shouldnt drastically change the core gameplay of a game after it gets a sizable loyal customerbase what constitutes a drastic change is up for debateim sorry if people do not like my broader view of player versus player but to me anytime you compete for limited resources the game becomes competitive yes even in such games as wow however if i came off as saying the cooperative part of the game has no place here you are mistaken this is an mmo none of us here should be playing to be solo and yes this means working together on common goals as it says in one of my channel motds pvp is more fun with a friend hell those who like to shoot other players are just as dependent on the industrialists to provide them ships  like it or notbut without pvp the games ecosystem will implode on itself there is just not enough item sinks for this game to work without it and thats why i call it the lynchpin of eve its not because i like to kick sand in peoples eyes its not because im antisocial indeed im actually adverse to willingly going into pvp on my ownmy corp directors often have to drag me by the ear into a roam but i recognize it as being the driving force that makes the other activities within the game doable there is no npcs out there to buy up your modules and ships and honestly there is few missions out there that are a risk to an experienced pilot thusly thats why i call eve pvp first because without it you wont have much of a game for very long without some drastic changes
you have to understand that deliliah is just an antipvp campaigner who is trolling the topic now with sophomoric word games ccp says its a pvp game ccp advertises it as a pvp game it also is a pvp game but deliliah and others support nerfing pvp so they need to play silly word games that get old after firstyear college english coursesits just the same old troll like during the campaign when deliliah rabidly attacked anybody who pointed out the facts about ank and claimed that anks raging hatred of piracy and desire to nerf it into the ground really meant that she wanted to make the game better for everybody plus the utter comedy of not understanding that the word darwinian refers to something a bit more up to date than the origin of species is just some good trollcomedy there its like an idiot trying to argue for why economics arent darwinian since were not sure which applies punctuated equilibrium or gradualism and of course its not a thematic arc someone should have given the troll a few more low grades on freshman english papers she writes like shes trying to apply a poststructrualist critique to mission running the essence of the entire game is a darwinian struggle for resources for space for market share for trade routes for time for kills whatever deliliah can troll her heart out and pretend that doesnt count since her freshman english comp 101 behavior is still intact and she can pretend that eve is a cosmos whatever she thinks that means and its not a pvp game because theyre introducing walking in stations because obviously if the xbox lobby feature allowed you to chat to people and you were represented via an avatar team fortress ii would be a cosmos and not a pvp game either eve is and always will be a pvp game those who dont like that should probably just leave already its simply kind of dumb to join up in team fortress ii and then whine about how theres so much shooting going on
hi kecian your point is both wellmade and welltaken in other posts ive noted that pvp is indispensable to eve this is very close to your linchpin idea as youve so well clarified it we might differ slightly in that i also think other aspects of the game are indispensable and thus linchpins of eve industry for example but im not sure we disagree here or are simply framing the matter differently a nonantagonistic difference so to speak would industry count as a linchpin activity in your mind are there other aspects of eve that are arguably dispensable or indispensable and would thus affect whether eve is though of as a pvpgame or sandbox with pvp maybe we should shift a longer discussion of this over to another thread im glad you enjoyed the rhetorical strategy delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
predictable trolling deliliah as always try harder at least make it funny and not simply pretentious team fortress ii is not a pvp game becauseit has ammunition that is a linchpin and you cant shoot anybody without obviously then tfii is not a pvp game but a game with ammunition and pvp you can build things thus it is not a game with ammunition and pvp but an industrialistammopvp game but tfii is also a game that relies on distance away from objects in order to calculate movement and lines of fire therefore it has space and thus it is a space simulation so tfii is really a space simulation game that happens to occur on a planet with gravity and it isnt really even a pvp game since you can play a medic all day and never hurt anybody in fact entire teams can play nothing but medics if they want and in fact you can even cooperate even while shooting people you can team up and if you havent seen a map you can even explore it with friends how crazy is that so obvious not a pvp game what does that make team fortress ii obviously it is a space simulation game with elements of pvp cooperation ammunition industry and exploration kinda like a cosmos only a pvp zealot would ever say that team fortress ii was a pvp game
thats becoming a bit of a common theme isnt it data gathering processing analysing repeatedly each of the 3 turns out to be flawed resulting into consequences and trends players signal long before ccp does this independant of ccps communicative and decision level capability to act on events and trends accurately and proactivelyits as if ccps economical viewpoint is one of the old school of externalised perspective combined with data point  snapshot methodology leading to situations where patterns and trends that players see  follow  push from an internalised  immersed perspective cannot be captured or even be properly mapped out over time and thus can barely be engaged on proactively  or even just correspondinglyits as if the perspectives methodology and processing objectives visible in the qen are pretty much what ccp  by analogy  relies on internally to base decisions on that is pretty scary even more scary then what became visible in the csm minutes in regards to business metrics and the interalised perspective of ccp management
this is the first ive heard of this csm as a group was not told about it in either an email to us nor mention on our internal forumssigh
a better title would have been player councils and agile development or how to troubleshoot corporate communications data processing consumer product value segregation and flexible decision processes through proper application of scrum and best practices business development methods with as a catchphrase all decision makers are equal but some decision makers are less equal then mostfigures why they want the meetings in seclusion and only upon request p
oh my
yes nice shafting potential in either case due to the unfortunate wording or freudian slipdo a poll inside the csm to decide whether they would rather be called tools or a waste of timegotta love the extra twist you can give useful tools when you put it next to another two word description beginning with useful
with apologies to the csm both of course  tools obviouslyanother facepalm from ccp where will they stop
heya alli believe it is best that i answer for this since i am the guy who will be holding this lecturethe summary for this lecture isin mmorpgs the usage of player councils is becoming more apparent and more widespread games like age of conan star trek online star wars galaxies and eve online have been known to use or are still using player councils but towards what ends can these player councils serve some better or another role as a community tool than what we have available alreadyi sent in the proposal sometime mid april this year and got an acceptance response the 28th of maynow i want to apologize for using the easily misconstrued word tool in the subject for the lecture we believe that the csm is an important tool or an instrument to increase the likelihood of the eve community being as healthy as possible the csm is a community instrument tool and in my opinion it is far from being a waste of time studying what we at ccp are doing compared to what other game companies are doing is a very healthy practice i believe and i try to be objective and critical when i look at the csm in comparison with what the other developers are doing this lecture is a part of that process other lectures that i have held about the csm arenonick bilbao spain  may 2010gdc austin now gdc online  september 2009gdc san fransisco  march 2009if you want to read about other developers that have gone further than ccp has with the csm you can read about a tale in the desert 4s laws or lambdamoo
military experts some dudes are predicting the surge in community health to take merely 18 monthsn
ccp xhagen it would be great if you could share a link to your presentation in this thread once youve given it at the conference any chance of that
he is correct however and i do think he is honest in this belief let me put it this way it is not the prc social media marketing we get served in other places nor is the comment subject to the usual ccp marketing overexposure challenge if anything the csm process  with all its flaws and issues and its highlighting of internal ccp challenges as a commercial organisation  is one of the aspects still in line with one of ccps core company values transparancy this aside of its experimental nature its evolution of role and purpose etcall the crazy stuff aside that have happened since the reykjavik sessions of this csm it is quite clear that as an instrument the csm exists quite well as an instrument of channeling and focusing community communications and sentiment that this is a double edged blade is something that speaks for itself  and thats not a bad thing since the csm even as an experiment prior to its stakeholder role and even now as sociological observation point has a wide variety of other current and potential uses for all parties involvedthat being said considering the csm this round has managed to somehow let ccp demonstrate its own bottlenecks and differences in perspective i do think it is fair to say that even within the current limitations and frustrations  as a process  the csm has a definite value to many player perspectivesbut i also think the time of experimentation is over with it a player council like the csm its been a few years of experimentation sure but those days are over just like hilmar once said perception is reality simply out of that viewpoint the expectation of the csm by ccp to get to work within roles and terms signals that the experimentation phase is over nobody denies it is an evolutionary concept and it will continue to evolve and grow and possibly even change but its yet another case where the pressure point is once again with ccp if this is to be serious it is time to get to work and csm has already begun that work visibly with accountability with workflow and with clear communications and timelines
soits august
i support them and wish i could call for a vote of no confidence in ccps leadership to sweep some csm members into those positions
i also support this dont spend time on making half assed crap instead improve and fix the old features first
supported
i wholeheartedly agree with this proposal
do it
could not agree more  some of the key success factors for scrum are excellence in quality transparency and continous communication

wr3cks1671441321311481085434243102023365692105108116127so while im looking at how a software company should prioritize development it occurred to me that you could order these csm items as a grid 3x3 or 3x4 one axis would describe overall intensityeffort required ranging from low rockets af 4th bonus to medium neuts on overview or reconnect to lost drones to high overhaul corpalliance interface a second axis would describe the nature of the team that would be required to implement the fix with the underlying assumption that certain kinds of dev resources coders who know cwhatever and can fix the guts of the game are more scarce than others producers who can update tables and make changes to content without programming or testers who i believe are among the lowestpaid and least technically savvy of studio employeesthe more intense projects say fw fixes or pos system overhauling would probably require more than one coder in addition to testers and possibly artists less intense projects would require one coder and a couple of testers showing implants on pod killmails even easier from a coding standpoint projects that require no coders but instead rely upon producergame dev types as well as testers these are mostly balance issues eg active tank viability in pvp minnie recons bops info war links rockets afs etcfinally a fourth category of ideasrequests require resources that fall outside of the traditional coderartisttestergamedev bucket like spanish translation requests having to do with the forums having the econ guy do another review of mineral sourcing etcanyways 02 hope the commentary doesnt muck up the regex engine that youre going to use to parse this page

good question id say one vote per person for now i dont think itll make that much of a difference and id like to keep it simpleactually when i was first elected i built myself a database for all the leftover csm4 issues that rated them multidimensionally feasibilityvalueurgency but feasibility is something you have to consult with ccp about and urgency is highly correlated with valueso for the purposes of this poll just rating on value gets you most of what you want for minimal complexitythere are probably several issues on the list that have been superseded i didnt have time to winnow them outnah it just throws away anything not formatted exactly the way i specified what good are the opinions of people who cant follow directions actually ill just handmassage the votes then run them into a custom app im going to whip up tomorrow that will generate the resultsthanks to everyone who has participated so far and i will post the results of course

id stand by the point that an interceptor is the best way to move small volumes of valuable cargo not only is it stupidly fast which saves you time it will blast right into warp from gate cloak so unless you fall asleep no one will even have the chance to lock you
or be proactive about the gankers sit at the undock of jita 44 in a fast hauler stabs and nanos ftw and just loot the wrecks as the gankers make them game mechanics  same ones the pirates lord on about  mean that they cant do a thing to stop you better still you can create a wreck looter alt in one easy step mince it and create another one all within the eula so that the wreck creators have no idea that it was you continually stealing their stuff 
so really why has this thread made it to 3 pagesmessenger001 is a alt toon this is either a troll or someone who needs to go play woweve attracts people because of the sandbox gameplay some people like this others dont those who dont shouldnt keep playing eve
confirming i possess a masochistic perversion which involves being held down and ravaged in lowsec ohhhh baby do it harderin fact i am so full of my aforementioned perversion that i just have to prance on over to highsec and share my experiences oh joyous days
finally got around to reading the second page and as for this partconfirming ill be waiting at said gate with a discophoon to meet you and since you are also an alt all you posts should be removed for trolling probably an alt of messenger001
i like the idea would be very cool to train to become a bh stealth camp c
i am not sure about the pod kill part but this would be the best feature added to eve since apocrypha

support finally high sec pirates can be actually countered 
signed and approvedbounties for drones p
issue it is not possible to have multiple jump clones in the same stationthis is a problem for anyone who uses multiple sets of implants on a regular basis limiting the number of clones available in a particular station limits the number of ships a pilot can fly effectivelysolution allow multiple clones per stationnotes if this is the intended mechanic what is the rp reasoning behind it will the clones fight each other governator style
jump cloning between implant clones in one station would be nice its not a huge deal in highlow sec space where there are multiple stations in a system but still this shouldnt be that tough to figure out supported no switching of implants  people need to stop suggesting this not supportedif so i will pay good isk to watch it i think the 24 hour timer is slightly painful thats a good thing its just long enough that you have to think do i really want to do this before clicking it but not so long that the answer is always no its stupid not supported
i would support point 1 as it used to work in the past i cant support point 2 for the same reason as seithso i cant support your proposal at all
the timer doesnt really matter to me i just didnt know whether the original issue was big enough to get any attention op updated now you can support me
mixing proposals is always bad as you cant really support it when you got one thumbs down in the list so one proposal per thread is betterto seith i think the op refers to clone jumping inside the same station this used to work in the past yes there are others who ask for easy implant swapping when inside the same station but i dont understand the proposal like that maybe the op can clarify that part so 1
exactly id like to for example have 3 clones in station a and one each in stations b and c in this situation id like to be able to jump between clones in station a without losing implants and also be able to jump from a clone in station a 3 clones to a clone in station b or c one clone each without losing a clone and implants
ive lost a clone this way i support thisalso would be nice if they would autopause the skill queue and autorestart it once the clone jump was completed its not a deal breaker but its like having those manual door locks that you have to unlock before you can open the car door from inside the vehicle in the front seat im not talking about the childproofed back seat locks

we are pushing the core issues hard but the point of this proposal is to prioritize a bunch of tiny fixes that can be stuffed into cracks its always good to have a plan b

okay so you said yourself eve is unrealistic i made a proposal to make it more realistic with regard to the political system i dont see how or why thats a bad argumentthe fact is there is an obvious rl analog to my proposal treaties and agreements and other peaceful transfers of territory also obviously most of what you listed is so unrealistic because theres no obvious rl analog to almost anything you mentioned of course thats all based on fiction and backstory
well i agree that theft should be possible but i dont agree that you cant find out who stole something and you have no option to counter the theft its like having bank employees with the access code to the vault but the vault comes without a cam recorder to see who entered now all are suspects if anything goes missing but the bank manager has no evidence when or who took something out even if only the security officer knows the access code and he becomes the main suspect the manager still cant prove that the security officer took something and the security officer cant say it the other way that the manager took out the missing itemnow if there was a log the manager can see clearly who was the last person taking an item out and if that person doesnt agree to place the item back then by that he declares being a thief and the corp can deal with it by standard actions claiming the thieves assets and blowing his ships upor the thief knows that the ceo can monitor who stole what so he need to plan his theft very careful like any bank robbers they need to have a plan of escape ie hide all his personal assets remove the ships from poses do the theft resign from corp and run so that the ceo and rest of the robbed corp will have a new target to chaseplace bounty on the head so i think this will add another aspect to the gametoday items go missing and no one can tell what happened to them the gms only say that you should have watched your assets closer so you go mad to find out who took your ship but cant do anything you loose trust in your corp mates this counters ccps idea that people should join corps in the end you are left as victim of crime without the option to revenge your hurt soulthink im over dramatizing hereabout the api thing  i feel that if we pay for the product it should give us all the needed tools in game provided by the developer whos pay check we the customers pay and not provided by third party developers who do it free of cost
well first of all they are alpha machines dps is not that important also with the right skills you should be able to fit the largest t2 guns available to them with no big problem an advise use micro auxiliary power core on frigatesdestroyers gives better grid bonus than a rcu2and again remember to keep separate the issues due to the ship and the issues due to the weapons railgunsblasters have problems on their own yes this makes the gallente and caldari destroyers subpar but fixing the ships isnt the solution a fix for the hybrid guns must come firsti didnt say they are perfect but they are good enough really if they were improved by more than a slight bit frigates wouldnt see any use whatsoever or at least they would last even less than what dictors last in fleet fights lol
destroyers need a little boosting but thats it if played well they can be devastating  300350 dps on a t1 small fast agile ship that costs if rigged 68m is amazingall i want is that all destroyer hulls get a total 2 mid slots 1 mwd 1 scramdisruptor no point on being frigate killers if they cant pinn them down also a slight cpu boost might needed in order to fit dps modsscram ok now i want too muchalso cormorant sucks face it best destro is amarr pulse fitted best range  300dps  dead frigate
hell no we dont need ships to be overpowered by design leave that to the ccp ups that occur regularlylet me do it for the ship i know bestcoercer now 250dp20km300dps7km 17ks 52k ehpcoercer then lol suck on this cruisersdestroyers already do their jobs perfectly fine all they require is for all of them to brought up to par with the thrasher with regards to fittingsi do agree with the signature reduction but that high a speed increase would make them too fast compared to the slower frigates cannot support
the cormorant is deceiving yes it probably has the lowest dps but has the best tracking if you manage to sit around your optimal at 70 kms with spikes you have about 3700 ms of maximum trackable transversal speed this means that even a dramiel going at full tangential speed will still be hit if you want even more tracking albeit at about 5km less of range iron charges offer you a trackable speed of around 13000 ms though of course both speeds depend on keeping range but then again you are not really going to solo in a destroyer are youso yeah it has its uses does even half decent dps at 26 km range with antimatter
so what if just you and a handfull dont want it its an expansion giving eve another layer of immersion as they create a total scifi experiance and that in my book cant be a bad thing im looking forward to incarna personally and i cant wait
resistance it futile
i really doubt that its a small handful that think a purely social expansion not focused on space is a bad idea while ccp goes about their grand plans of avatars walking in station what makes eve is slowly being left to rot where we once had 1000 ship battles we now get node death with 200 alliance after alliance declares that the old sovereignty system was better and faction warfare is forgotten ccp is so focused on implementing new content as fast as possible they have lost the commitment to excellence that made us all enjoy this game say what you want troll where you will i still say scrap incarna and fix whats here
i know many people who found the idea of an mmo with no character avatar repulsive i would imagine the largest slice of the playerbase that wants incarna hasnt subsribed yet because of its absence if you dont like eve as is stop playing if you do like it stop demanding it be fixed asapi like it will still like it tomorrow and will like it more after incarna
good idea massive sarcasmtheyve spent god knows how long working on it so it at this point would be much more of a waste of resources than releasing it
i dont see how the fixing eve part of development could be enhanced the slightest bit by reallocating all the modellers and animators from the incarna team to the eve team therefore of course not supported since it is bogus
i find your lack of faith distrubingpersonally i dont want incarna i want a playable internet space ship game were i use my internet space ships to kill other peeps in internet space ships and not broken pos broken sov broken pi broken fw broken mechanics and truckloads of lag i look past these things becuase eve is one heck of a game which i will gladly fork over 15 a month for if ccp is going to release wis then i guess im along for the ride
please refrain from using the word immersion and eve in the same sentence or posteve is internet space subs in space there is no los and 5000ms is considered fast eve will never be immersive so stop using that as an excuse to defend incarna
im not happy about incarna either but it is the obvious next step for ccp to dedicate their resources to i will admit that when i first started eve i thought it was odd that i would never seem my character other than that small portrait i doubt incarna will add anything of value to me in this game but there can be no doubt it will attract more subscribers than fixing rockets and afs will it keep more subscribers i doubt it because people who play now signed up for this game despite knowing you will never see your character other than the little portraiti predict a 30 boost in subscriptions within the first 9 months of incarnas introduction i also predict a bit of a drop in the meantime though
there are a lot of us who wantwanted incarna but not as its being portrayed now by ccp as nothing more than a social expansion but scrapping it is by no means the answer ccp has already invested too much time and resources into it to just throw it away what needs to be done though is to put it on hold or at least slow it down so that some of those resources and manpower can be put back into the current eve with the intent of fixing and polishing the broken and halffinished featuresas for the comments about immersion immersion is a personal perception what constitutes immersion for one player may not do a thing for the next person being a scifi fan most of my life eve is an extremely immersive game to me but the lack of an actual avatar does detract from that somewhat not enough to keep me from playing though i must admit when i first started the game and began customizing my portrait i seriously thought it would be used more i spent quite a bit of time on each of my portraits three accounts with all the slots filled to get just the right look and expression to project what i envisioned the personality of that character to be but it was pretty much a waste of time because the portraits are so small and used so little ingame that the small nuances that give the character character are lost hopefully this will change with incarna but to be realistic im not setting my hopes too high given ccps recent track record with a lot of hype and promises for their expansions and then delivering subpar results which are halffinished or broken and then left to languish in their backlog i just started a blog over at evepresscom  of immortals  dusteaters  an eve chronicle my first blog  footprints in the dust  is a short story entry into the contest inspired by images of eve competition 2 at starfleetcommscom the story illustrates one aspect of what incarna could be instead of just minigames and socializing over the time between now and its release there will be more of this type of fiction as well as any info available on incarna and dust 514 along with discussions incarna has sooo much potential it will be a real shame if ccp holds to the social aspect alone and ignors everything else that it couldshould benot supported
it is not a purely social expansion it is focused on space  the stations are in space im looking forward to incarna along with a lot of other people so i wont support this proposal
propose a destruct modscargo feature to be added that can be activated to destroy all valuables when a ship pops on condition it invalidates insurance should discourage highsec suicide gank and allow anemic lowsec markets to be seeded it would also encourage more natural forms of piracy as in ransoming instead of destructionits a logical and natural action thats been done frequently irl in the past by shippers against frequent piracy although only by drug runners now in modern times due to infrequency of irl piracy currently and preference for ransoming instead of destruction when they do occur the practice wouldve also have developed naturally in eve if only game mechanics didnt arbitrarily block it
bitter suicide gank victimnot supported
supportedmy pirate alt rarely get a chance to ransom ppl just make certain assumptions and dont respond to it ransoming becoming a norm would make it more interesting to be a real pirateas for highsec gankers sucks for them those losers regard huge rewardsno risk exploit as their birthright come over to low and well show them the ropes
someone remember the uproar about white wolf corp and alliance and the number of wardec they has simply because they were a corp mostly made by ww employeeshaving the devs playing eve is a good thing the problem is the tinfoil army calling them a brigade is too reductivethey are the main reason why the playing devgm are very wary joining the sov holding alliances the possibility to get back your character with another name dont compensate for losing all your contacts and in game friends if you are discovered from the replies in the gf we have a good number of devs willing to confirm that they play eve lets hope they will increase
scenariolets say your alliance is on a major offensive and resupplying pilots with ships guns and ammo is going to difficult my proposal would be let supercarriers andor titans produce goods at a greatly accelerated speed in exchange for a 5 10 15  increase in the mineral cost of the itemi think it would bring an interesting dynamic to the game it would be nice however to offset this by making attacking sov alittle harder but i digress 
im no 00 junkie but did you just say make attacking sov harderi dont think youll get much support for that bit of itlag is already bad and a good number of people already find supercarriers to be on the overpowered side i dont think they need this
its called a rorqualsuper capitals are offensivemilitary ships not industry not that im stopping anyone from slapping a mining laser on said ships if they have turret slots
fair enough point let the rorq do that then
yep add rorqs big brother that cant dock or go into wormholes but has builtin refinery massive cargo capacity and industry slots to produce anything a station can should be worth 23 outpost prices though
ccp liked ahnks ideas so much that they had to stage an nda breach to get her out of the csm and into their dev pool
tldr summary1 she lied on her resume about working for ccp2 she lied about saying she developed some sort of mmogame thing as part of her unaccredited educational requirement3 she lied to her employer at the time4 she then disclosed a bunch of internal privileged information she got from ccp being a member of the csmso her employer at the time contacted ccp had a nice little chat and ccp dropped the announcement she got bounced like a ping pong ball now everyone is all hushhush waiting for the lawyers to determine if they are going to andor where they are going to file legal actionin the meantime she should never be able to work in the industry again due to the publicity and google and good riddance its people like her that should never be promoted from dishwasher and even that kind of a position might be a little too difficult apparently she even had an episode involving a spoon at the summitoh and i couldnt think of a much nicer thing to happen to such a useless carebear mind you it is partially ccps fault as they should have disqualified her from running in the first place primarily for being an idiot but realistically for working at a potential competitor
they do work for ccp and get reembursed by free flights and hotels twice a year they work for their pr department while not as a registered employee but still do work on behalf of ccp for communication between their customers and ccp themselves basically a customer service pr donkeycan you link us the internal information she leaked i havnt seen thatanybody that thinks that the csm is doing anything else other than that is a complete blind numpty
no they dont work for ccp as in no they are not employees and no they arent consultants either they are considered guests having won a prize in a gameand no i wont provide any links or supporting information that is privileged and even though i have no nda to adhere to you monkeys dont deserve the details before you complain and shout proof or stfu ccp has been happily keeping you in the dark for years feeding you crap and you still latch on to it all you need to know is that is what she did if you had a clue you would do a little searching and come up with the legal measures filed stupid numptyregarding the csm it was always intended to be a free trip to iceland to chat about eve nothing more nothing less it was marketed under the guise of actually doing something to appease the player base but as everyone in the industry knows you dont listen to your player base it would be like a farmer asking for advice from his cow  not ever going to happen he might bring the cow into his house for some strangeness but never would make a decision influence by the cowyou can say m00 now edit oh and to retort your proof or it didnt happen spewage she got bounced for nda disclosure which by definition means she disclosed privileged information not surprisingly you fail to understand that simple concept but then again you are in hydra which does explain why you are incapable of doing so not quite sure but it might have something to do with your alliance fixation on the seven rings of the dragon or whatever you monkeys fap over
so on one hand you say factually they leaked information yet on the other you cannot back it updo you see the problem with your so called factual posting if it has been leaked then it is already out there so just direct me to it unless you cannot back up what you saytheir legal issues are not my problem and not my job nor effort to enforce if anybody has this so called leaked information please direct us to it nothing was leaked you cannot back up what say
ummm point of reference herecows dont pay a subscription to be on the farmjust sayin
if i give a beggar on the street a quid and my packed lunch im not employing them to have asked me for a handout
well actually she kind of did the csm is a volunteer service that works on behalf of ccp to filter all the whiney on the forum into something they can present to ccp part of this role means they are very very minorly involved in the development process also everyone exagerates on their cv lord knows i do my one day a week volunteering at a charity is bigged up to more than just stuffing letters into envelops and taking 3 hour lunch breaks
i want to know what was leaked for someting being leaked its sure hard to find on the internetnothing was leaked by definition if you claim otherwise back up your statement lord xsiv just is spouting about someting he knows nothing about failed to back up his statement about the leak he aparently is an expert on
its sorta self describing acronym aint it ndaand u got owned so badly here i was laughing my ass off
moved from general discussion to assembly hall
just because you are too dumb to figure it out doesnt mean it isnt trueanyhow go back to figuring out how to attain your sixth ring of the dragon master club or something
he stated he is not bound by an nda and claimed to be the expert on the topic at hand  leak by definition means its leaked to somewhere where did it go deadspace
this yearss csm didnt bend over happidly like usual and a the result was a lot of bad press for ccp as a result the marketing division of ccp did a bit of archeology into the blogs of the csm members when they dug out some old leaked information on the most unpopular csm member they fired hersince then the other csm members havnt really been as critical as they were before and the community didnt really care because everyone already hated ankmarketing divison scores
what was the leaked information for all this huff puff nobody seems to know but yet they act like they doyou state it was leaked on the internet to a blog please link that blog if it has been deleted i can find it on the internet archive that is if it existed in the first placethe poster below me states it was leaked to her company what was the name of that company please she worked for aparentlyso far in this thread you have stated 2 destinations of the leak one to a blog on the very public interet so show it please and two to the company she was working for so name that companysee what happens when you act like you know the full facts you will get questions that you cannot answer why because you know diddlyps i never broke quote tags the last numpty to post broke them i just replied  not that i care what you think i think i will break quote tags if it makes you cry like that
to the company she worked for that isnt ccp which they are understandably keep rather mum about because if ank or that company did talk about it then ccp would be in prime position to drop a metaphorical ton of legal sht on their heads also learn to not break quote tags
nobody were ever told well aside from it not being related to her csm blog
yeah but you should tell that to the experts posting in this thread that seem to know but cannot answer a simple question
you mean obvious troll heh dont feed him and hell go away
thats right i do know diddly squat wouldnt be much point in an nda if everyone knew about it now would there but its well within my mental capacity to make some educated guesses firstly the information she broke the nda with was not posted on a blog this has been confirmed by at least two csm members on mutliple occassions the only other logical choices would be either a news company or the company she worked for if the press had gotten hold of it then we would all definately know about it thus it makes the company she works or now worked for the logical answer i could of course be wrong her blogs are here and hereor just stick to failing at scamming people in rens that works too
well that is why were are the experts and you are apeonas i said earlier it is privileged information which part of that dont you understand just because you are a clueless nupty doesnt give you the right to demand proofs links or any other explanation that might consider you a logical entity in the discussion the op asked what happened and i gave the tldr without having anyones panties getting tied up in a bunch so to speakanyhow what is more interesting is the hydra thing that deals with rings dragons wackamole and other fairylike fantasy role playing crap ank is old news she has and is being dealt with appropriately that is all you as a peon need to know
milla stop being edthe point is not whether it can be proved or not ccp doesnt give a crap what you think about thatndas is their businessasking for proof is like asking me to divulge classified military data that was leaked by joe shmuck but to leak it would get me in hot water as well whether i know it or notlike i said edgive it upbesides you got 10 fingers and a brain go google iti never liked ank anyway good riddance
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesprobably she was giving ccp trouble and said something wrong in her blog so they got rid of her no biggie life continues
it was because she found out the truth about ccps connection with the flying saucers at area 51
they still have the option to hire mercs a lot corps will fight for free if you pay the dec fee or fight the wardeccers themselves
1 i havent been in the trade but i dont know manyany mercenaries that fight for free2 if they dont want to fight theyre not going to since the deccers are likely looking for targets they lose by deccing someone whos going to run id consider it a victory escaping from someone who wants to blast my defenseless ship at every turni think the wardec mechanic needs an overhaul in general but forcing people to endure griefing isnt it
not supported as said above you are war deccing a corp or alliancei think if a corp is at war there should be a 24hr window before a player can leave a corporation regardless of roles during war time but not be a valid war target once heshe leaves the corporation
right now the csm is trying to work out some solutions to make ccps mass testing on singularity more effective as well as making more people participate ive created an unofficial poll to try to get a better handle on peoples attitudes in my alliance and id like to get the general population to answer the same questions as well so please answer to the best of your ability if there is a yes or no answer please say yes or no before elaborating

hehesarcasm noted eldaecas to the lag issues and stability this isnt as bad as it sounds mechanics wise right now your ship utilizes weapons bonusesoften provided by supporting allies ships you get pluses for certain weapons or items equipped that turn on when powered up and turn off when powered downa player crew should be thought of as an item which provides bonuses when present and online just as equipment doesspecific crew slots on ships and types for effect would have to be established my thoughts simply as a thumbnail outline are the captain of the ship sets permissions and activations just as a ceo does for a corporation or a fleet captain does for fleet membersso lets say a ship holds four additional crew slots think of them as a new form of rig the ships owning player would designate the roles for each other player filling these slots along with permissions and the like he may approve one as an engineer another as a navigator another as a gunner and the last as drone pilot these roles would be a standard and not created by playersfor a more detailed example lets say that the gunnery role allows the players gunnery skills to be utilized the engineers engineering skills etc etc the captain could put these players online and offline just as he normally could equipment and he could also jettison their pods the captain also could designate whether or not reputation and profit would be shared from missions or bounties crew members could take themselves offline and jettison their pods at will captains might also allow a crew member to control specified ship systems as in reloading weapons initiating warp or operating ecmwhatever equipment was affected by their position the crew player display would be a shared overview and having the look view available for the ship or other objects in spacethe goal is to allow junior players to get involved with older players more quickly by selecting useful specialties that might let them get selected the danger of spies is lessened by the captains settings but not totally negated they could give away position poscargo codes planned actions and even system info and the like i think this would liven the real aspect a lot traders could have characters on a ship to monitor trade hubsa good job for an altgive him some narrow combat skills along with the tradingwe could debate all day about if ccp will do it etc but nothing to be gained from that convo i just like the idea
vladimir your not the only one that would love to have coop ships ccp too would love this they have tryed making something like this work on titians as that was going to be there role a kind of moble pos forward war stationbut they ran into major problems with there programing on this so its way back on the logs now labled as imposable to do as of right now becouse of all the programing that would be req in order to get this one thing in gameif eve is around for another 1020 years this mite happen if they keep a small team working on it over the years or something i dont know
get rid of fleet finderyeah thats right remove that clunky obstuse useless little bugger honestly it does absolutely nothing except alleviate some work on the part of fcs wcs and scs in inviting people to fleet  and at least half the time it isnt even used when it could be a lot of people seem to think it may have something to do with the increase in lag  personally id just rip the thing out and leave it at that while youre at it revert the eve mail system to its predominion state its laggy buggy overly complex and cluttered and really hasnt made anything easier at all compared to the oldwhile youre at that change the market browser system thingamajig by either changing it so that lists are not autoupdated every time you make a transaction and instead require you to press a button to refresh so when i go and type in an item and then the list of orders comes up i can rightclick on whichever and buy however many i need and thats that  i do not need to be instantly and automatically informed that the number of items i bought has indeed been subtracted from the sell order i bought it from while youre at that change the fitting screen so that by default all of that information on the righthand side  about your tank speed resistances etc  doesnt show unless you specifically click a button or something saying i want to see all of this info and then load it then tbqh i never look at this information because usually its wrong or omits quite important information such as the amount of capacitor generated by a cap booster or how much cap you use when you have some of your mods unactivatedi believe that doing these things could very well decrease a heck of a lot of information going back and forth between clients and servers think about it no more constant loot logging and hundreds of people looking at fleet adverts no more thousands upon thousands of market query updates every second no more thousands of fittings screens calculating stuff this should increase both client performance and decrease server load

supported low sec needs to be more profitable
i would only support this if you still had to find a system that was within jump range in normal space to your worm hole systemgood luck with that considering there is no lore saying that wspace systems are anywhere close to new eden
reading the thread your final goal is to make it a clone of normal alliance 00 no thanks
no it is not i am perfectly happy with no gates and no local and no cynoing caps and no jump clones trust me allowing covert cyno jumping within wspace would introduce a new dimension for pvp in wspace without ruining what is already thereedit blah wrong char again

bumb  sorry but i really thing ppl should pay attention to this well traders  speculators mostlyeven if these derivatives could not be traded as is they could still be implemented somehow simpler and downtoevebond contracts given out by corporations or even alliances can be created too covered by assets of course at a fixed percentage 3090 for exampleloan contracts too with the difference of these requiring fixed payments instead who cares if they will not get used a lot there will still be specific situation where they will be appropriatefor example there may be locked items in a 00 npc station that noone wants to buy joe doe the banker though is not afraid to jump a freighter there and pick it up so he loans the guy out why will the customer not just simply sell it well he may hope that one day he could use it again or that he just had a fight with his former corp that lives there and he hopes that in 6 months time they will leave the place who knowsin optionsfutures contract there will be risk involved because the collateral has to be kept low say 1  10 of the total asset value on todays prices it will be fairly easy for the seller manufacturer to forfeit the contract in case he finds the market price better at maturity there is however always the possibility that the buyer will back down at the deadline in that case the manufacturer get a compensation also percentage based say 01  3but thats where a new kind of blacklist can come to force entirely automated and filled with ppl individuals and corporation that forfeited this new class of contracts a class that will require you to have trained skills on the new category called financial agreements skills that will enable you to loan at progressively lower percentagewise collateral say 90 at lvl1 80 level 2 etcnow imagine for a second that all those contract types are added to the game and they involve so many choices regarding percentages how far in the future etc how big a fee  collateral big trusted entities or individuals will ask to be loaned at better rates or for longer periods and vice versa they will loan only if highly securedof course all these agreements will be tracked by a financial exchange mechanism of the game where the history of each entity will be visible to all much like the employment history that now exists etc
lol
plain and simple corporations should not be able to surrender implicitly when leaving an alliance this mechanic is far overused to save poss in highsec from attack its impossible to do any mercenary work related on the matter for a wardec that costs 50 million isk when not engaged with anything at the start only to watch as the corporation who was the designated target leave the alliance and get off scottfree with a corporation x has surrendered to you were sorry but you have no choice but to let them go on their merry old game breaking wayspetitioning is not effective for action to take place gms must have proof that the corporation has left the alliance to dodge the wardec and only to dodge it and it is only feasible to prove it if the corporation decides to rejoin the alliance lucky for the scared weasels that cant defend their own assets they are able to lie all they want to gms to give reason that the leave was reasonableso i come forward with a somewhat reasonable fix corporations that leave an alliance during a declaration war should have an option tied to them of whether or not the attacking group would like to pay to append war rights to the defecting corp group a attacks alliance b with corp c in it c leaves alliance b group a gets an option to war dec c instantly assuming they pay for the new declaration and have one of their three slots open this takes away the ability for a corp to dodge a pos loss by simply leaving alliance the instant it gets attacked and having a full 48 hours to repair it strip it of all items and leave a barren tower with nothing but defensesbottom line eve is all about risk and reward if i pay good money to attack your pos and you simply leave to cheat your way out of a loss you are breaking the system people who suicide gank someone cannot escape concord by just logging off people who put their assets on display for the whole world had better be able to defend them and if they cannot defend them they should pay to defend them and if they cant afford to defend them then they dont deserve themflame suit on ready for angsty war dodgers
posting to support my own idea
why not just let declarations be able to overlap the cooldown so that you can declare as soon you see the surrender mail with 24hrs to activation by overlapping the aggression against the carebear pos can be continued uninterrupted minus any tardiness on the aggressors partorwhen declaring and the target is a specific structure let the declaration be against a corp at an alliance fee if corporation drops then next bill is lower but war continues unabated 
not supportednothing stoping you from wardecing the corp directly nowthis is just a case of buro red ink over powering the sword same thing happends in real life all the time i see no reson to change this in game how can you call yourselfs warrors when crying over pen ink so you have to wait a day or three before geting to spill more blood get over itedit you dont even have to wait any time to gank the corp mebers just fit up mister cheap fleet fit ganker and get them you can make them pay for leaving to pass the time that you can renew your assult on the tower
thishighsec wardec costs were already lowered to chumpchange why dont ccp just give you free kill mails instead its a multiplayer game you dont get everything to go your way all the time
a throwing a fit over 50mil isk  epic failb failing to understand that you can rewardec fleeing corporation  even worse failsorry pal while your motivations are spot on as well as your intended inclinationyou got some serious holes in your thinkingand if you say you have too many wardecs well thats your problemand the above is very likely why the gms dont bother much as it is
wowum you seriously have to much emotional investment in this game as a game there is nothing that will break it if ccp were so inclined they could even allow you to blow up entire planets in a game then you could have another game item made up of little 1s and 0s that reconstructed a planet anyway you saw fit its a game nothing breaks it and certainly not my idea what youre suggesting is a hypothetical result in which the players of eve abuse the systemif someone was going to abuse this system they would need to have direct contact with their victim as such the victims ship is already blown up in 99 of all hypothetical situations in which someone wishes to grief another player i mean the entire point of griefing a player in game is to pop their  all over space why would you care to track them if youre already 5000m next to themi would suggest that the only advantages this would have would be in clean up after a major fleet battle in tracking down anyone that wasnt scrammed or possibly if they had an ecm and got away basically you took my idea and decided it was a horrible idea because the people in eve online are horrible to each otherlol ive been playing for about 3ish years i fail to see how that has anything at all to do with this conversation you just like to stroke your ego claiming your experienceah thats not worth itno my idea isnt horrible here is why1 the restrictions on the weapontracking system makes it have limited use not only that but as soon as someone docks the weapon is disabled2 in your example in all cases if someone got within 5000m you are most likely dead the exception to this is if you had an ecm burst as most other ecms have a longer range than 5000m 3 there are many many times in which one of the lesser peeps in eve online well call them griefers are for once out numbered evading someone is a two way street when they are outnumbered and out gunned they will run this is just another tool to use the idea that it will be abused is rather mute as i saidits a game it is not built on the laws of physicswe can turn it into whatever we want this is what i want so kidquit whining
my problem with the idea has to do with the fact that its a lazymans mechanic and that it stacks the odds of combat in favor of the aggressorstronger opponent if someone you have engaged gets out of point range and warps off to a gate make an educated guess and follow them if they warp off to a safespot well if you really want to kill them get a prober out and start scanning should the person elude you and escape good for them that person may be a chicken but heshe survived to fight another daywith your mechanic it becomes impossible to use evasion and skirmish tactics whard he go eraldun worry boss i gots one shot on im i be fleet warpin ta im in 5 secsgood job eral i knew we could counts on yabe a man work for your prey
cute very cutelike the last poster said stop whining and stop being lazyyou want to work for something great how about making ccp fix the bloody game and not add new features for the next 6 months to a yearthats a great idea try that on for sizewe dont need any new featureswe need stabilitypolishingetcthis isnt a fixthis isnt a patchthis is an idea poorly written might i mention that changes mechanicswe already have a crapload of them that are screwyno thankscome back when you do some research and spend some time with people from various larger pvp alliances and then tell us its a great idea
sensible objections to this can be summed up as1 ops proposal is at best vague he makes no comment as to what the fitting requirements or skill prereqs of his homing beacon launcher are hell he hasnt put enough thought into this to give it a name there is no provision in the proposal for what the skill levels of electronics upgrades are required for the fc  target2 if the ops proposal does not allow for the tracked ship to be warped to directly a la probes it is essentially pointless and already provided for by extant game mechanics  locator agents scouts pursuit3 if the ops proposal does allow the tracked target to be warped to directly a la probes it is gamebreaking renders probing effectively irrelevant makes several tactics nonviable and makes it beyond simple to hunt people down by firing a single shot at them4 ops proposal makes no allowance for how this mechanic would deal with cloaked vessels5 ops belief that if something gets within 5km of you you are dead without ecm burst indicates the lack of experience with pvp tactics and situations previously commented on gatecrashing anyone
id say it would be possibly useful and not op if this beacon or whatever you tag them with just made them a lot easier to scan downwould be removed with repairrepackage has stacking penalties and does not work when cloaked
and add back in the 10 day warning timer

perhaps a better way of handling it would be for drones to work in formations based on the grouping of the droneslet the server just deal with the coordinates of a formation and the clients spread the individual drones out around that formation coordinate
i love it when finnagain underscores my points through example thanks finn
of course its a pvp game i dont understand why anyones arguing that it isntexibit a an interview from a few years ago touching on the initial vision for eve and explaining why pvp is a core element of the game and not just an aspect of it
hi chi thanks for the link very interesting i think youll need something a tad stronger than that to claim eve is simply a pvpgame emphasizing the importance of pvp versus pve is entirely consistent with a sandbox that fully integrates pvp alongside other activities i dont think anyone on this topic has claimed that pvp is not an indispensable element to eve moreover this interview is from 2005 and you need to consider the changes to the game since then i say this not to deny the importance of pvp but to place it in context delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
if eve was just simply a pvp game why not do away with the whole miningeconomysec status thing and just let people bash away at each other to the best of their skills oh wait  if it has these other things then that means  taddah its not just a pvp game afterallguess the simple gets confused for the complex by the simple on these forums
nobody anywhere has said that the only thing you can do in eve is pvp and the reason behind miningthe economy is so that players have to work to produce ships and they therefore have value so when youre popped andor podded you feel it its the set of consequences and context that ccp designed in purposefully to make pvp richer if you dont understand sec statuss role in pvp im not even sure where to begin
forgive me but the way you  and others  carry on a bystander would be under the impression that the only thing of any relevance in this game is pvp if that is the case then many many players are in fact wasting their time in this gamewhat you and others seem to ignore is that plenty of people play eve for everything but pvp you could even make a realistic call and say that 75 of the player base couldnt give a toss about pvp and would still play the game if it was restricted to just 00i did a typo and put in sec status instead of system status empirelowsecoo my mistake
maybe a particularly dense bystander thats not my fault though im also not going to spend any effort explaining things to such a hypothetical brain donor as for you not understanding how system security status factors into pvp ah well id point out that concord is punitive and not prohibitive but meh
eve is a pvp game by default because virtually all of the pve content is mindnumbingly dull just sayin
tbh that is kind of my mental reaction whenever anybody says they pve in eve onlywhythe pve content is eve is absolutely horrible there are any number of single player games that are much much better if you like grind play disgaea if you like spaceship pewpew play freelancer or freespace 1  2 and so oneve while the servers actually let you has the best pvp of any game on the net and after four years i still have my pulse spike and get an adrenalin rush every now and again when i engage a targetof course we dont have any actual metrics on how many people live in 00 and how many live in empire the best we have are screenshots of character locations which tell us nothing really i have iirc four characters in 00 now and 10 in empire judging player occupationnature by the location of all chars in the game is simply loopy02
last time i checked i  and everyone else here  were not you thankfully  what a sad world that would of been still doesnt seem to prevent you from shoving your sad little ideals about the game down everyone elses throat and last i saw there was nothing in the eula about playing the game in any particular stylethough with that many accounts maybe your view of the world is slightly skewed to the strange end of the spectrum no wonder though everyone treats you like a joke 
ok weve established that eve is a pvp game can we get on to other subjectssome of what has happened in this situation is blind speculation we really cannot know for certain what happened until ankh quits the game and posts the issues at hand and ccp confirmswhat we do know is that ccp has a track record of unprofessional actions by members of its staff they work very hard to eliminate discussion of past transgressions that have actually come to light and one wonders what has occured that has never been known by the player baseis it possible that ccp may have taken action within a set of guidelines they interpret and created yes likely we can only look at other companies in any field and see if the humans running them would take an action of that type to see if that is soaside from pvp issues or pve issues we do need some sort of transparency from ccp on a number of issues i cant see them changing their stance though i for one would like to know that no employee of the company ever play eve during their employment it opens the door for too many temptations to abuse their position i would also like to see a mechanic in the game implemented to bring balance issues to the player base as a whole one that can be viewed by all in terms of statistics of complaints the type of issues people are concerned about as an entire community and not simply the player base that decided to post on a forum buried somewhere inside a huge morass of other content and discussionwith ccps track record of unbalancing the game through employee indiscretion as well as actively seeking to eliminate any vocalization of these events we as a community of players needs a better and more open sytem of management of our interestsi for one find very little wrong with the mechanics of the game overall there are some glaring exceptions and these need to be addressed ccp knows that adding shine to the game pads their wallet i cant fault them for that but in the interests of keeping players in the long term and cutting down on the amount of adspace they need to buy from gaming magazines to keep new recruits in working on the existing aspects to make the flawless game they are capable of as well as eliminating the issues of mistrust from the player base should be a prime concern
almost certainly will not happen nda breach is a careerending accusation and the fact that its been weeks since anks denial and promise of new information tomorrow it seems unlikely that shes got anything else to say and ccp opens themselves up to legal damagechallenge if they release information that they do not have to as for keeping devs away from understanding the game by playing it thats a horrible idea you want people to design and tweak a game they dont actually understand because one dev in the history of the game gave one decent and a bunch of fairly lame t2 bpos to his buddies very bad idea as is balance by complain frequency balance doesnt mean appeasement it means balance if they were truly going to balance piracysuicide ganking with bears theyd have to hugely boost the gankers it wont ever happen of course but should they further nerf them just because one of the perennial whines is about how unbalanced those dreadful gankers are and how they need to be put in their place trolling removed zymurgist
dw  does pvp depend on industry yes i believe i acknowledged that indeed the two sides are interdependent on each other in ways that extremists on both sides of the fence refuse to acknowledge can pvp exist without industry no more than industry can exist without pvp without substantial changesbut still you cannot push aside pvp as the core aspect of the game yes i acknowledge there are those who have no wish to engage in pvp i would call those people willfully ignorant given the nature of the game as i have stated before player versus player goes beyond simple combat it stretches into trade and industry as well really the only part of the game that has the least amount of pvp is missionrunning  unless somebody comes in and takes your looti found myself pondering the sandbox definition as well today a game that advertises itself as a sandbox needs give the players a great deal of freedom to do as they desire eve succeeds at this greatly and many of us myself included see the ability to shoot each other being tied to this you cannot separate the two and call it a true sandbox i believe those in the hardcore pve end of the spectrum realize this as well is this why i see many of you clinging to the term cosmos instead a convenient word you can use to spin the meaning of eve away from its true soulbut i suppose that is away from the true purpose of this thread afterall were supposed to be discussing the removal of a certain csm no a csm that i truly believe only became as big as she did because the extremists on the pvp crowd gave her attention she frankly didnt deserve they might have been better served at keeping their mouths shut rather than opening them and making the pvp crowd look like a bunch of neaderthals if anything their extremist attacks only strengthened her position and honestly these people really should stay out of the politics of the situation and stick to what theyre good at  being the predators that make this game interesting to folks like meas for the removal of ankh it is my position that if she did breech an nda then they are well within their rights to remove her elected or not our elected officials need to be held to the same standards as everybody else to not remove her would send a message to the players that ccp is still not above playing favoritesshould they reveal what the breech was there is no need to do so i find ankhs silence after all this time to be telling enough of her guilt
 finnagain zero the first thing i would like to point out is that youve been selective in what aspects of my post you chose to focus oni should have been more succint when i was discussing a new format for players to assist in redressing balance issue
of course why should i respond to things that i have no interest in discussing what mysterious replacements titans have been petitioned and returned iirc but there was never any form of stealth replacement as for moo come on that was what 7 years ago now the only actual events you have to point to were t20 and a public and obvious decision that the devs made to deal with moo that they later regretted and havent duplicated in more than half a decade there are plenty of valid complaints to lay at ccps feet without breaking out the tinfoil youve invented a fantasy extremist in order to construct your argument quote one pvper anywhere honestly saying that their ships are created by magic and that nobody has to build them pvpers in the main understand exactly what role industry serves all absolutely all of the substantive attacks on ankhybonkeybonkers relied on her own words her own beliefs and her own actions all nothing was extremist and it turns out people were absolutely right she had some major damage that caused her to be unable to differentiate real life and actions taken in a video game she was unstable and unable to work with others and eventually she stepped so far out of line that ccp removed her those of us who warned the community about her were right those who voted for her were not only wrong they hilariously made sure that instead of a hardcore carebear that they wanted to elect the person who actually fills that seat now is from pandemic legion
im beggining to wonder if ccp created a ficticious nda breach so they could get anhk out of the csm and into their damage control team  if only id voted for myself eh i have more accounts than the difference between mine and mynxs vote counts  and i was the more obvious care bear choice right 
bet the lawyers are going to have a field day with you  especially considering that you are making adverse reputational and personal aspersions about a person whose name profession and nationally are widely known herejust goes to show what sort of a very stupid person you really are finnagain i hope you get torn a new one by her lawyers
its possible but ultimately very unlikely an nda breach is just about as serious a charge as you can make in the games industry like alleging a doctor never actually finished med school or an accountant is skimming money off the top if ccp had invented an nda breach ank would have been able to prove it and would have had a massive lawsuit against them barring some truly weird circumstances it sure seems that ank did something to merit dismissalheh thatll teach you not to take full advantage of every single facet in eve online i do think of course that there wouldve been some much better choices that anks voters could have made which would have still resulted in dedicated bears on the council who would have also kept their seats in the end the people who voted for her did so with their eyes open the facts on the table and the utter unsuitability of their candidate clear they cut their noses off to spite their faces so they could say nyeh nyeh pvpers you cant make us do anything not even if youre backed up by facts logic and common sense you you you grieferstactical error it turned out
oh please i didnt invent anything here finn extremists exist in every walk of life doesnt matter which creed religion political party or eve playstyle you belong to its just a fact of the human condition that such people exist even you with the exaggerated style in which ive watched you attack peoples posts come off as one of them it doesnt matter if this is what you truly are as its the image you are projecting sure ankh said these things however its my view that having personalities extremely unpopular with the hardcore bear crowd denouncing her did more to help her campaign than hurt if for no other reason than to watch those who profess how they like to watch others cry over internet spaceships get all tearyeyed themselves delicious irony such as that would be great giggles to a vengeful carebeari will concede you this point you are right in that pvprs in general do acknowledge they are dependent on the industrialist i think most of them just want the same acknowledgement from the industrialists in return indeed i see events such as hulkageddon as a awakening to that branch of the community that they too must take their turn in the great cycle
i havent exaggerated anything in anybodys post and even if you believe i come off as an extremist in your personal approximation that still doesnt make me one the pvp extremists are as real as the pvp fundamentalists and are both just created as rhetorical crutches the same with anks campaign nobody was crying about anything and as youve admitted their charges were accurate and your earlier claim about extremist attacks is spurious unless of course youre misusing extremist in the same sense youre misusing it where im concerned that is to mean someonesomething i do not personally care for but thats not a very good definitionfurther the fact that people voted for her despite her manifest unsuitability and all the facts on that score being clearly laid out is their fault and they got what they deserved the universe has a sense of humor sometimes this is the point pvpers by and large dont object to people bearing in fact many pvpers have to bear from time to time to make the isk they need to shoot stuff they do object to people who create accounts in a pvp game eve online and then go bonkers when they find out that there is pvp in this pvp game people like the late and unlamented csm delegate who so confused reality with fantasy that she thought people who blow things up in a video game were actual sociopaths since someone who blows things up in real life would have to have something wrong with them
you should run for the csm  all of their posts get created then edited over with nvm when they remember the futility of it all
can i suggest some of you read thismissing eve economy discussion in it the csm 5 meeting
i deleted my post because it provided zero information im quite sure that the csm is busy enough championing our issues so i dont want them to waste time on replying to my bs
your admiration to a lost cause is to be admired im sure though that they are championing their own perks and game status more than anything else selfcentredness and player abuse seems to be the hallmark of csm5 in this and many others humble opinion
you seem to forget that the way the csm is comprised if it has nothing to do with fleet fights and lag its really not worth mentioning if you want something else in this game other than 00 lagfests then this is not the game for you
is it wrong to have an ecrush on virt im surprised you didnt mention this at the summit as it might have been interesting to include in your presentation some quotes for perspective from the csm side of the mirrorbut whatever the thing thats on my mind is the fact that ccps dev planning meetings are scheduled for 18 august this is presumably when stakeholder priorities are championed when competed against the priorities of all other stakeholders because of the current existing limitations on the workflow communicative and prioritization processes for csmccp interaction we really need you there to be the csm championyetyoull be at gdc on the 16th giving your presentation then the gamescon business meetings are 18 august are you planning to attend those or will you be returning to iceland so that you can champion csm issues at the dev meetings orhave the dev meetings been rescheduled and i just dont know about that yet considering how many ccp folks are likely to be at gdcgamescon should they be rescheduled for a time when more of the key players will be available to provide input and champion their prioritiesupdate just got an email stating that ccp diagoras will be there instead of petur at the dev planning meetings wtb more mohawk championship
player councils in mmos useful tools or waste of timecool  do we actually get to vote on this like we did the game of the year awards ive been looking for the button to register my vote for waste of time but couldnt find it still what a good anagram for the clowncil of stellar management  csm  wot
now there is an interesting event  as far as i know the product owner is responsible for managing the decision making process in scrum so i guess its up to his due dilligence who gets involvedrelated thread
you are not apologizing you are blaming people to misconstrue how you do refer to them as tools for ccp the customer isnt always rightcsm actions is yet another form of user generated content you do earn your daily bread withor you dont earn your daily bread with depending on how well you can guarantee quality of gm specific user generated contentim sorry to reply to your request after three weeks ive forwarded your request without result for now may i close this issue nevertheless for example is nothing one would expect from professional customer carewhat you should study is quality assurance measures across the communication pathways of parties managementdevelopmentcsmusers and identify single points of failureyou might benefit way more doing that than referring to csm in a way which can be perceived as thats some kind of riot control stun gunwe are paying customers not terrorists who must get tooled
very interesting
someone said something like what is the purpose of a player council anyway flying them to iceland has any company ever listened to them i have searched and browsed all the relevant threads but i cannot find it againill reply anyway yes its called a user group or user interest group and while they are a pain in the butt to manage they provide invaluable information all successful software products have them why should an mmo be so differentim turning into a virt fanboi as well 
as someone who helps run a corp comprising of a large inflow of newbs i have to say that what has been said about representation for newer players on the csm is something that does need to be addressed looking at it and having had some experience in swg in their profession based system way back when leaving out the majority of your player base is a recipe for disasterwhilst i can appreciate what finnagain zero says i do not agree with him many people come to this game having played other mmos in the past i know for myself that we have new eve players who have been playing mmos since the days of mud to say that these people cannot bring anything to eve is a very blinkered view of peoples abilitieseven veterans of the game i have been playing since 2004 can still be considered nubs in a lot of things i know that there are still plenty of things in this game that i have yet to try  and thats even after all these years playing and on the reverse side of the coin i have corp members who after a couple of months in game are as good as if not better than people who have played the game for yearsto restrict the membership of the csm to just a small subset of the player base does defeat the purpose of the council for stellar management if it is not representative of all players then it will only ever be of interest to the few
but people must first see your perspective so far all we have from your posts is the mental picture of you sticking crayons up your nose and asking if you resemble a popcicle if you wish to be relevant to a discussion then post something relevent otherwise gtfo
may i suggest completely reordering the entire marketplace section rather than patching it upits a complete mess atm wading through everything when youre looking for a particular thing create a player services section for those running services  relabel sell orders into something a little more intuitive like wanted to sell  and the same wtb for that matter remove price check  theres almost zero replyactivity in there possibly create a general market bazaar to bucket anything that dont fit into the categories the lotteries can go into this
ashina sitothe weapons and ships of eve are already pretty well balanced the fact that we only have one sub group of about what 30 that people agree needs a boost demonstrates this same with afs as a subclass of ships when we include all the different types of ship classes and sub classes there are about what 25 balanced classes and sub classes now think about eve as a whole how many different scenarios can you pvp you can pvp for the following reasons1 for sov 2 just for fun  no real background necessary3 because youre a merc or a griefer4 pirating or taking poses in whs for profit 5 fw occupancy6 some other reason the first 4 reasons to pvp will often lead to the same strategy to win lets form a big fleet and blob anything that gets in our way now there are exceptions but in general i see this as the biggest reason of how eve can get stale this strategy is a good strategy to win the first 4 scenariosfw offers a war scenario where it could be a better strategy to actually break up your blob and go out in multiple smaller gangs to plex for occupancy but the current occupancy plexing mechanic is garbage so no one does it hence eve pvp always resorts to the same old formula for success blob for the win now im not complaining too much the actual battles when you actually get something close to even  which is imo too rare are tactically complex and allot of fun also there is an art to forming a good gang no doubt both aspects are great in eve but you rarely have a situation where you say lets break up our large gang into many smaller gangs because we have multiple important places to be at the same time fw and or some other low sec development could facilitate that this i think would be a real breakthrough for evein other words its much more important to have even a single new pvp dynamic than it is to add a 31th competitive weapon system or a 26th new subclass of ship
well look on the bright side august 10 at gdc alli ottarsson from ccp is going to explain it all
but bitter suck up is still bitter
as opposed to player support growing as they become more effective  didnt realise that the csm was all about innovative new ways of putting carts in front of donkeys
get off your ass ccp and fix  one of my closest friends quit today cause shes tired of dealing with all the  thats come to past thanks to your poor level of management or interest in the matter
seems i already supported it p
ccp take a 6 months bug fix and dont deliver us a new extension we want existing bug out no more new stuff you will no more attract people with extensions cause there is now too much bug active

well a friend in uk pointed me to this article that explains exactly why eve is being left to rot at the moment and why dust is being jammed down our throats
yes supercarriers should be bigger than dreads 
make my epeen bigger
yeah supporting this
i support this idea mostly in the fact that those field css need a boost making them fit the role of small gang cs as opposed the the fleet css fleet gang cs would be a good way to increase their usefulnessoh and get their hull on par with tier 2 bcs slots pgcpu
supportedwould love to take some of these out for a spin but the costquality tradeoff vastly favors bcs as the op states
these are all small things that probably wouldnt take that long to be dealt with if ccp were actually spending time and resources on fixes and improving the game
unfortunately my outofgame friends who i play eve with are too risk averse to set foot outside highsec after years of carebear conditioning in their drakes and ravens i have absolutely no problem with 00 having all the juicy loot it just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth that my advice to new players when it comes to highsec exploration is almost but not quite radar or keep looking
well tbh player 00 if you are in a decent alliance is almost as safe as high sec anywayyeah i can understand that but its hardly a site problem its just that the market decided that most rig components are worthless and only some 3 or 5 components are worth somethinga little rebalancing would be hard to do and would upset the market balance anyway

yeah some of the issues were already implemented while sorting the mess csm part of the wiki was its not hard to slip a mistake here or there thanx for voting everyone

thanks so much for sharing your opinions on how to prioritize issues everyone it adds a lot of weight to the priorities that csm submits to the devs when we can say that players helped significantly to define those prioritiesgratz to trebor for being awesome in leading the charge with this approach and writing the little programs he uses to parse the feedback

in before ccp forgets about fixing the lag again and instead invents ai constructed lotterys into the game as massive isk sinkoh and supported p
i wholeheartedly support this endeavour
this is largly a implementation of the swg bounty system it needs more itteration from everyone but as player who litterally deadicated years to this system me in swg this is a good first draft  obviously there are issues lets work through them just to clarify  this statement implys we some how fudge our kb wrong our killboard is api fed its always been api fed every single kill and loss goes on unless the loss is to a npc this is fairly standard practice if you find any that arnt on there mail me in game and i will fix it  shouldnt be the case due to the api however  deaths and kills prior to the api being implemented are some what out of our control  and i wont post anything thats not api varifiedadmittedly not posting losses with npcs might be slightly fraudulent due to us having suicided a lot recently however that was for hulkageddon and i couldnt be arsed changing it  having said that we havent made carreers out of suiciding  thats been a very recent thing brought on by a in game event now getting of the subject of damts kb and to get the thread back on track bump for a good idea that needs some work
this would add consequences to killing noobs actually
still no refute as to how any bounty hunter is gonna get through your corps or any other pirate blobs even your 2030 most recent kills and losses r not api verified which means u still posted your friendly fire kills manually therefore u fudge your killboard and even lie about it

like i said getting multiple clones in a station should be an easy fix seeing as all my complaints were removed from the proposal ill be supporting

hmm okay yes impacts on rats will be soundless if they are too far away that is pretty much the same issue as with explosionslaunching missiles works for me currently i will retest and try with different missiles and launchershybrids are probably comparable to projectiles in terms of sound coding so i think all turrets are still fixed for now p
can be usefull
as a ceo who has had his corp ripped off several times i too am annoyed with the inability to track thefts the only way to even begin to theorize who has stolen is to run multiple member searches to weed out those who have access but for general hangars it does nothing a change log would be excellent i however dislike the concept of making this a skill based thingup corp hangar change logs for all hangars in all forms perhaps with an api feeddown skill related decrypting unless it allows for someone without access to eliminate the log thus allowing for some legit gaming
it would be nice to be able to track changes to selected corp hangars even if it wasnt to track corp thefts it would be nice to see who is grabbing corp ships
scuse me i wasnt saying you dont need to know whose stolen whathell i had a director who got his account hacked i would love nothing more than to beat the ever living  out of the guy who stole our directors stuff and my corp assetsso please dont misunderstand me when i say im in favor of finding out whowhat for the interest of loggingmy main point however is i initially thought you where griping about the thefttheft is a normal way of life in eve cant stop it but nothing should stop us ceosdirectors from tracking down the jerk who did said act
named micro auxiliary power cores are expensive meta 34 are very expensive so ill assume you talk about t1 versionsso an advise check before giving advices
actually reactor controls give a percentage pg bonus aux power cores give a flat 10 pg more for the meta 14 for a rcu 2 15 to kick out an extra 10 pg the ship would have to have about 68 pg to start with aux power core wins on subcruiser fits
im also looking forward to incarna i love strategy games and have played them since i was seven years old and they were board games with cardboard units and took hours or weeks to finish i love space fighter games and have played them since privateer and tie fighter i also love science fiction which is what got me into gaming in the first place and as a scifi and gaming fan am at a loss as to how this small core of extremely vocal negative players can see incarna as destroying eve it adds another layer and potential to it when dust and incarna and the like are all laid as foundations i have no doubt more effort will go back to improving the million little details that need attentionmy impression as a newer player reading through the forums is there is a big group of eve pvpers who feel having monster gankfests with their friends is the only reason to be here and it isntyou can play eve and stay out of stations the fact that others might enjoy them is a plus and doesnt hurt you a bit i really feel this is all about control and fear that new features might be ones you cant dominate so you dont want them play for fun and stop worrying if others might have some you cant dominate its a game stay in space if you dont want to interact in stations if incarna comes out and increases lag and instability then hey you got a point thenbut that hasnt happened yet why dont we wait and seefyi ccp is a business and it makes sense they test the watersis what allows you to play in the first place nothing wrong with immersion eitherparticularly in a scifi game in space otherwise they might as well just make it a turn based weekly tournament for fleet battles and solve all your gripes play cod if you dont want any immersion and strictly think its just about killboards
bore off i can use whatever words i want to describe eve so i dont think a stubborn comment like that is gonna make a difference
it being present may not hurt us but it doesnt really help either thats the point its pretty much a seperate game the problem is when ccp indicates they have allocated 80 of their development resources to seperate games like incarna for the next 2 years that means our game will be stagnant for a long time im not saying ccp shouldnt do this but they also shouldnt expect the people who currently play eve to be thrilled about it strutting around in a station in different wardrobes is not what many who play eve are looking for if it was they would have likely picked a different mmo to begin with
this right here is a great point so many developers are being used to develop what many believe is essentially a test for the world of darkness game
this proposal is for a new ship class the ship class is for a holo ship the holographic ship is a type of recon ship or another type of ship im not sure yetidea 1the ship can disguise itself by using holo emitters around the hull to project another ship either next to the ship or disguise the ship itselfidea 2the item can be used by any ship that has enough cpupowergrid there will be restrictions thoughidea 3 the itemship will hide by making you look like a npc rat or something static like an asteroid
a cloak does all of these things but without the flavorstick to the cloak
a hybrid does the same as a laser it killssure this does the same but in a different waythe idea is not to hide but tell give false intel to your enemy
there are some interesting things that could probably be done if a player ship can be disguised like a completely different kind of player shipsupported in principle
00 carebear tears best tears cd 
definately need to find a way to get more devs out into the fights if theyre sharing in the bloodlust theyll definately be ed when a reinforced node crashes with just over 500 people in system
devs dont even want to develop the game never mind play it
i thought most of the devs still played eve guess not supporting this
beautiful idea it would be great if it had a corp hangar affectively make a corporation sized mobile station d
how many times youve done a fleet and even with loot history you cant stop that little moron to loot everything on the field while your still shooting war targets it seems like he got loot salvaging level 5true we got loot history and you can yell whine scream emo rage quit and argue with the guy who took your loot to give it backif he ever does so how about a feature in fleet that prevents anyone in your fleet to not open a wreckexcluding salvagingthis should be totally optional as some buddies can be trustedothers not once the fc activates that feature anyone can take loot with that feature he could decide who can take loot or not since it could be a right clicking items in a menu once you rightclick on a fleet memberadvantagemore control over who takes what lootif someone dies you could easily give him some loot since he lost his shipthen you activate looting for everyoneno more stealingdisadvantageprobably more whining and rage since fc will finally have control over the looting history is good but not enough this is eve its not pink and fluffy
and that stops my neutral alt in a frigate from looting howthis sounds even worse than the complains from the privateers guysnot supported
secret word here is fleet ok fleet members onlygo ahead with your neutral alt on a gate after a fight and go loot be my guest the feature im telling here is for fleet members onlyps if your a neut alt and loot a wreck in low or 00well the same mechanics applies here nothing else change go flip cans in high sec if you wish with this feature it wont affect youonly your fleet members also learn to read correctly you seriously need it
kick the guy from corpalliancefleet if it is only one person doing it it usually is obvious over time you know when they get killed with a full rack of salvagers in a fleet fight
the person can just leave fleet to loot and rejoin besides ccps not gonna do something like this if theyre still letting neutrals or reds lootsalvage wrecksthis is rather sad its just some cheap mods you must be really poor if its worth making effort over
uhm  yes if i steal from your corp members you could shoot me sadly with your npc corp only you could shoot me and you are dead already pthe main problem is  while your fleet members cant loot everyone else can so if they could normally save some modules before the some hostile gang lands you now loose all loot how does that sound useful you think the fc will have time to allow looting for all when he has to sort out the exit strategy for the gangand the whole feature could fire back on you  i start the gang and fc only allow looting for me and loot happily while you fightall in all that feature would harm you more in the long run than it would serve you

ank i mean milla good to see you back
lord xsiv mad
i support addressing this but not your actual proposalhow about a player that leaves a corp after a war is declared is unable to rejoin that corp for a full month or more after the wardec ends same with regards to corps dropping out of alliances
works for me but not the ops idea thats for sure
while i agree the issue needs to be addressed i dont think the ops got the right idea on how to do it i cant think of a better one myself but im certainly not going to support replacing one bad idea with anotherbetter the devil you know and all thatnot supported
its usually expirates or nullsec pvpers that have become mercs but need to build a name for their new banner
no but ive ment to on several occasions rl interfered small empire griefer corp nodidnt believe the test would accomplish anything a littlesisi patching was too hard gave up no issues with patching however the documentation about how to patch needs some work as several of my friends whod never done it before got really confusedgenerally didnt carea littlewasnt aware of it sometimesscheduled at a bad time yesprevious tests were poorly conducted so i no longer participatedplease specifyi never participated in a test but ive heard that they tend to not start on timeother please specify a lot of times my skills on sisi dont match my skills on tq it gets really annoying when i go to fit something i use on tq only to find i cant use it on sisi also the markets tend to be laggy andor not work half the time so its annoying to spend 15 minutes trying to buy stuff to fit new ships i might be slightly more motivated especially if they provided faction charges for my blasters unsure of the meaning of this question no itd probably get too spammy with people shouting worn out memes about whoever was running the fleet interesting idea but i dont know how practical it would be id assume there would be even more advanced notice required than for reinforcing a node id not test anything on tq for ccp that might involve a loss of more than a few mill that they werent willing to reimburse at least partially regardless of a screwup on their part sure assuming it fits in my rl schedule it would be nice if ccp would either give some advanced warning about when the mirrors are going to happen or let us request that our individual characters get mirrored over even if it was limited to like once a month or something it would also be great if the market would seed frequently used faction items such as navy antimatteridea how about for one of the mass testing events you have a few devs load their carriers with nonseeded items like faction ammoshipsmodules id definitely make an effort to sign up for that
i have participated in the past and there have been no improvements i am no longer interesting in helping a company who i already pay run their qa department the arrogance of ccp displayed these last few months about the lag situation is unacceptable both the vote for us in the eu game contest and 18 months and well start working on lag crap has been some of the worst bull ive seen come out of ccp in my 5 years of playing this game nobody who matters read those of us in 00 or people who dont want wowinspace gives a crap about pi wis or dust we want to play the fleet battles without having black screens like ccp shows in their trailers until the lag ty ui and general attitude towards the player base changes im moving back down to one account and paying with isk
for those who think the mass testings have done nothing you may want to learn to read
fantastic looking graphs there too bad the game still doesnt work thats how i determine improvement you know going from unplayable to playable not unplayable to still unplayable but sometimes a few people can load the grid if theyre ing lucky
i no  i tried copying my eve folder once and connecting to sisi but i got build issues so left itthe rest of your qns i wont answersuffice to say my participation would be much more if ccp made it easier yes im a technophobe so sue me
have you ever participated in a sisi mass testyeswere any of these factors the reason you have been prevented in participating in a mass test on sisiprevious tests were poorly conducted so i no longer participatereasonothers and me waited for a gang invite for 2hrswe mentioned repeatedly that we have not gotten the invitethen test was overi see it as a favor towards ccp if i spend my freetime trying to help them improve the gameas such bad organisation and failure to provide gang invites toall people who showed up is inexcuseablealso reinvites need to be issued if people that dropped from gang due to game crash ask for them there needs to be one person in charge of the invites for the whole duration of the test which was not the case when i participatedi will definatly not waste any more of my time showing up for these events in the foreseeable futurenote this was one of the earlier mass tests so maybe organization got better in the later ones no idea since i did not show up again
as i said in the other threadmake it easier to get on the test server i dont care about down load times but i dont want to do anything more than click some buttons on screen and enter my password

scheduled at bad timei have other appointments every thursday evening so if i could mwd across entire town in 15 minutes maybe i could only be very late for mass testone day when i had free time when testing was done ccp patched tq that day and there was no patch from that version of tq to sisi
why  mass tests started 1 years ago anything happened no hmmm yes the lag worsen than ever before with mass tests because ccp dont listen to players what they said and what need to fixso this mass tests is useless in sisi
well you wont make me do anythingnow if you want to propose some sort of play tester arrangement where players are paid isk or skill points for their time and aggravation on the sisi test server for these grand experiments then maybe that would be the beginning of a solution to getting more folks to participatery
can their testers not automate mass testing by simulating players via connections it isnt that hard to simulate that they already have the code in the npc rats just make that a connection based one for each aspect they want to mass testdo they ever do stress testing if so that should show where the weak spots are very quicklyhow about for my participation in doing their job for them they reemburse me somewhat perhaps with skill points like they give for the last patch messotherwise i will not do their job for themps voting threads are against forum rules

voting poll threads are against forum rules every time they are posted ccp take them down so why should we keep yours
couple reasonscsm candidate made the poll probably specifically to address current issuesop is from pl and we all know they have 1337 dev hax and can get away with anything
csm issues belong in the proper forum not general is the csm that stupid they cannot even post in the correct forum and adhere to the forum rules they expect us to followps poll  vote  hence the term going to the polls
this is a survey not a vote it merely asks questions on a specific topic in order to obtain feedback and opinion as lag can affect anyone in the game i suggest that this is exactly the right forum for it

i saw a great suggestion in the official testing threadgive people who participate 100000 skill points on tq its free to ccp and it makes us not feel like were paying ccp to do their qa and integration testing for themits what two and a half days training time for a couple of hours worth of work id do that
moved from general discussion all csm related discussions should be posted here
dont you think thats a little counterproductive in this case id argue that the rules should be relaxed a little in the interest of the game
in csm meeting minutes it was stated that csm would assist in finding out why people do not participate as much as needed  wanted in these affairs to get feedback you need general discussion on top of that ccp wants people to participate people by default so you need the exposure which again means general discussionall due respect but have a think for a moment dumping the initiative does not aid in ccps focus or effort or commitment nor that of the csm in aiding ccp in this
have you ever participated in a sisi mass testyes two of the earlier ones back when i had hopewhat role do you play in evemedium corp in a large 00 alliancedo you regularly participate in big 00 fleet fightsyes including several where the server was the only winnerwere any of these factors the reason you have been prevented in participating in a mass test on sisididnt believe the test would accomplish anythingused to be no but my faith is rapidly demishingsisi patching was too hard gave upnogenerally didnt carenowasnt aware of ityes and no i used to have to keep a close eye on the forums to find mass test times but now with the login screen ads i think this is headed in the right directionscheduled at a bad timeliving in the american east cost tz and having a 95 job means i usually dont get home until 2130 meaning i miss many of the tests on weekdays weekend tests are normally fine but a few 22002300 tests would be niceprevious tests were poorly conducted so i no longer participatedthis had been my biggest demotivator for mass tests both mass tests i participated in were slow to arrange and ran late due to low organization it would be nice to actually get some real eve fcs to step up and lead 2 realistic fleets in a way similar to normal eve battles fighting over a sov structure or something similarother please specifywould you participate in a sisi mass test if they gave you perks you would never get on tq like max skillpoints or supercapsit would intice me a little i suppose but it may also bring in a lot of people that arnt interested in the test that only came on to play with the new toyswould you participate in a sisi mass test if there was a tq tournament going on that required itspecifically the sort of playerrun sort of events that dont involve creation of iskmaybe probably not thoughwould you participate in a sisi mass test if someone really famous and well liked commanded the fleet on sisiyes i think something like this would both bring in large numbers as well as give better data than normal staged testsif they used code injection on tq in a fleet fight but only if both parties consented and everyone knew in advance that there would be no reimbursement just like usual would you ever consent to participating in the testnormally i would say no but at this point things cant get much worse as far as large scale 00 fights so i would reluctantly approve as long as the players were well informed and we got some feedback that our help actually netted resultswhat sort of situations would be excluded from ever being tested if ccp refused to give reimbursement for deaths incurred during tq code injection upsi think ccp needs to be very careful with how it handles supercaps and reimbursements especially if their meddling has the potential to cause disasterous results players often invest massive amounts of time and effort for these ships and i personally would be incredibly upset to lose one on a technicality or glitch as opposed to a legitimate death in the heat of battlewould you ever participate in any sort of sisi mass testing if there was no immediate and direct isk reward on tqthe reward for me ultimately is playable battles on tq so direct rewards are of less interest to me in the first placeis there anything major that this survey has missed that you think could greatly help the testing efforti would like to see more status updates on this lag issue from ccp even if a specific test gives no useful data it would be very nice to have status blogs detailing how each test went
that thread is a survey not a poll despite mazzs illconsidered use of the word poll in the titleconfining csm proposals to ah is one thing its unreasonable to expect every csminitiated discussion to occur in ah since we are expected to reach out to the entire playerbase and cover all aspects of the gameplease put this thread back in general discussion where it is likely to get seen by a lot more players help us help ccpthats the whole point of this survey if youre going to put obstacles in the path of that by moving every single thread we initiate to one corner of the forums where people might not look how the hell are we supposed to do that

carrying on from previous posti would like ccp to be open and up front with the paying public there is a great deal of anger towards you guys at the moment and no real reply from you many questions have been asked and nothing being saidive not really followed the 18 month saga but ive picked up on the fact that there are no real plans to fix the issues that are currently here i appreciate that you have teams of devs focussing on other areas such as dust and incarna and they will have specialities a graphics designer isnt a code monkey and viceversa but it seems that eve is on the brink of collapse and nothing really seems to happen im not talking about todays tq downtime but there are problems flagged up on the forums and nothing seems to happen about them maybe if ccp made decent announcements that they are working on certain problems or even explaining why they cant just fix them immediately would go a small way to help the situationid be great if eve2 was written with new code and databases that are up to the job but the feasibility of this is extremely unlikely

yeah the united states does tend to follow judaeochristian traditions in a lot of respects and calendars starting with sunday is one of those traditions in the united states and websites created primarily by americans you will almost never see a calendar start with monday it almost always starts with sundayeve online notwithstanding i cant remember the last time i ever saw a calendar start with monday thats how rare it is over here
thanksi didnt know that answers my questions bytheway thats what i think they are afterbeing around for another 1020 years instead of being a flashinthepan things like dust and incarna and tyrannis are layers of detail that can be built on and improvednot distractions and takeaways id say they are pretty smart i stayed away from eve for the past three years after hearing it was nothing but scrambling for cash and big ships so you could pvp all the time i found that something that would get old pretty quick and wasnt paying monthly for it it was only when i heard about planetary development in tyrannis that i decided to give it a shotnow i am hooked
i like the idea i recently found 8 poss belonging to 1 corp all inactive i joined the corps public chat channel to find it empty for weeks why should this space clutter take up valuable moons it makes more sense to be able to steal it instead of blowing it up it cleans up clutter and it keeps active corps on their toes to make sure poss dont go offlinei like a 30 day timer idea where an inactive pos has a timer when it can be unanchored
1 oh so many junk towers floating around
this would be nice
 finnagain zerolets be clear here youre the altar boy and im the priest when it comes to creating a viable arguement you have a well developed style that takes comments and ideas out of their full context and focuses on a single interprtation of t
kinky but no dont strain yourself patting yourself on the back though i quote the ideas im responding to you just respond to the individual ideas that you want to respond to i just use the specific text im talking about in order to do it no there arent there was a seven year old overt act that ccp has since changed policy on and a scandal with a single dev who gave bpos to bob and lost his job because of it even if there was a spate of corruption which there isnt it doesnt change the fact that you actually want devs to be banned from playing the game it is impossible to get a visceral sense for the dynamic and balance of the game without being able to actually experience it if more devs had actually had to sit there and try to drop a tcu may be wed have gotten a better sov system nope you didnt rebut anything and your mindreading act fails i havent played devils advocate i have pointed out where youre wrongin point of fact i stopped discussing your players provide something because its a silly proposal and i had no interest in chewing it over you quibbled over the issue of what balance was as differing from appeasement while drawing no actual distinction between the two players who complain form the data set that ccp would use to compile statistics that is if ccp listened to player complains they would indeed end up appeasing the people whose complaints made up the statistics thats part of why direct democracy is mob rule your comment about ccp devs misses the fact that the lack of trust for ccp is a fairly silly policy and ia already exists to police improper dev actions
 finnagain zeroive gone over this blog and seen the manner in which you respond to posts you take the ideas that are presented and hone in on a specific set of word usages in order to either force yet another overly technical explanation on the subj
timathai  hate to tell you this but you are arguing with a fanboi and a rather irrational one at that not that by definition there are rational ones but you get my meaning hopefully when confronted by these there is not really much you can do or s
like i said you and everybody else does the same exact thing i pointed out for instance that you and i both respond to the ideas we want to respond to and ignore the rest that we dont want to respond to in your response you just mentioned that i post the text of and respond to the issues i want to discuss and didnt discuss the rest which is perfectly fair selecting which points you want to respond to is part and parcel of a discussion that doesnt take forever the suggestion that you made is nonviable as you presented it i doubt it can be refined to the point of viability and even if it can somehow what you suggested is by your own reckoning not viable pointing out that it was not a good suggestion because it was not viable is not beyond the pale nor is it obtuse to point out the fact that you just agreed to your idea is nonviable in its current state
given that  by their own admission ankh only got as many votes as she did because pvpers wanted to troll other pvper  one could say that her consituency is still fairly well represented ps if anyone knows what ankh actually did please evemail me
id wager that the pvpers voting for ank to grief other pvpers were a fairly small number of voters but thats just a guess point still stands that those bears who did vote for her got royally karmada process i would note that seems to have driven some of them utterly round the bend
finny me lad you must change your name to the myoptic oneoh yes the small forum segment compared to total players of our sandbox mustsupport csm5
myopia has an actual definition you know it sounds cool and i think it means something bad is not a great reason to use a word you dont know if youre going to use non sequitors at least go for the gusto you quisling anklebiting debutante or something in any case not sure what your other non sequitor about supporting the csm has to do with anything thats been said recently but of course eves playerbase should support the csm whether they voted for them or not the csm are the one and only group of people who have the direct attention of ccp devs as part of the official development cycle and the one and only group of people who can give a unified representation of the playerbases needs and desires wrt the development of the game to those devs glad we had this talk
is this entire thread fanbois ing that someone who broke the law got bootedshe dropped off the face of the planet the day she got caught doesnt take a genius to figure out why
as long as this thread has continued i think we have hashed out all that can be with our current information at hand the person in question is silent ccp isnt adding anything to the conversation and we all have on our tinfoil hats and have taken off our glasses at this point nearsighted people have difficulty reading highway signs and seeing other objects at a distance but can see for upclose tasks such as reading or sewing i got the myopia reference and its no surprise that finnagain didnt ive said that ccps past unprofessional actions have had an effect on this issue and let my self get in to a long winded discussion defending this it doesnt make it any less true for those in defense of ccp your hearts in the right place and i hope they have changed their stance on how they deal with the playerbase for those in defense of ankh if you think that a company would make an accusation of that type involving an actual real life contractual agreement without a solid bulletproof reason your tinfoil hat is blocking out the sunregardless of what the circumstances were that lead up to the breach of the nda or when it occurred it did happen as a professional and someone in the industry ankh should have known betterplease close this thread its wasting our time and ccps at this point
that would require it to be an actual reference and not a contentfree insult in other words an actual accusation and not lol i dont like you now im going to use a word that i think means something bad its about as solid of a reference as the rhetoric about pvp extremists or fanatics ah well
quoting this for sheer comedic value csm has nothing to do with the player base csm has nothing to do with providing a unifying representation of anyone beyond themselves and their own petty wants its funny how 88 of player sees it as an irrelevancy how ccp themselves see it as an irrelevancy but fanbois like you cling to it like you cling to your wooby blanketnow that one of the loafers has been turfed we just have to wait for the rest of the useless oxygen thieves to fall after her oh and no no alt supporter for poor sad eva  just a concerned playertrolling removed zymurgist
i think how much of a virt fanboy you are is directly related to how much of what he says you actually understand half the time i like him half the time my eyes glaze over  i mean im sure hes making good sense in the abstract but theres a limit on how much businessspeak i can parse
confirming the csm are viewed as tools by ccp
virt is the only poster i know of who regularly violates the forum rule that all posts must be in english while still posting in englishthe tldr versions of a virt post are usually tldr
oiget to work you tools stop stalking an honest player seriously i dont even do forums that much
i disagree that a chair on the csm should automatically be reserved for a newer player instead if a newer player wants on the csm then they should work to get their votes the same as any other candidate if they manage to get elected even without having a lot of prior time ingame building up a network or a following then they probably really do have what it takes to get up to speed on the game knowledge needed to be a contributing and productive member of csm csm is not an easy job it requires some degree of knowledge of game mechanics and history i suspect new players would have a very difficult time weighing in productively on the wide variety of issues raised and bigger picture discussions that take place i would be concerned that the csm process would get bogged down worse than it is already by the need to have to bring such players up to speed on topics they knew nothing about so that they could at least understand the context of an issue well enough to cast informed votes at working meetings you may think i sound elitist but i am merely making a practical observationhowever interested new players can get involved theres nothing stopping a new player from getting in touch with a csm delegate and offering to work with them regarding new player issues any csm who is engaged in the job of being a delegate should welcome this in fact i can easily imagine a new player committee that is mentored so to speak by a csm the committe could do the leg work on proposals to address new player issues bring those to their csm mentor and then the csm mentor could advise them on the proposal coach them in posting and getting support for it then assuming that works out the delegate could raise the issue in a meeting for a csm votethe benefit of that approach is that a more new players can get involved b they learn more about the game and csm process along the way and c the mentor can give the new players community exposure which would be useful groundlaying for the new players own csm campaign should they decide to runit would be pretty neat if part of the responsibility of being a csm delegate was to adopt one special interest player committee to work with on nonnda stuff i have thought about this some and have several ideas about how it might work the processes that might be used and the benefits to be gained just havent had time to put those thoughts together in a csm mentors guide for player special interest groups andto be honestthis is not a program that would appeal to all csm delegates as the amount of time and effort each is able or willing to put into this volunteer position varies widelyhowever given the current situation regarding the lack of dev resources for csm issues for the next few expansions ive been trying to do nonissues related csm stuff that is both tangible and productive producing a guide like this might be one of those things if people have ideas about the concept id love to hear them
i just wanna point out that this isnt much worse than the typical turnout for local elections in my county
thanks a lot for pi insert heavy sarcasm ive been really lusting for a system that allows me to stare at a static image while i click the same button 100 timesday who needs garbage like cosmos with its unique missions and rewardsits been said that nothing will change until subscriber numbers start to suffer i dont know about the rest of you but if it gets bad enough that i have to quit and im almost there i am never coming back there wont be any second chances we the player have put up with a lot because the game is based on some great ideas that cant really be found elsewhere but if you continue screwing up the implementation good ideas wont be enough to save the game in the end your competitors will catch on  catch up there are other companies out there making good games dont make me play them how big of a stake does that guy have in ccp anyway the article doesnt say but it seems like 100 by the way things are going this reminds me of that douche kotick from activision who started selling warcraft mounts to pay for his sexual harassment law suitsi can think of a few bugs right off the top of my head that have been in the game since ive been playing which is completely unacceptable fix long standing bugs fix lag fix socket closed finish  refine content that should have been finished years ago i and everyone i know would much rather have these things than incarna or any other new feature200 support

definately supported id give up wis and the winter expansion in favour of ccp fixing all the things theyve done in a halfarsed manor what i would suggest the csm do is push ccp to ask the community to vote for which features they see as most critical to fix over the next 18 months one vote per account and to commit to a realistic time scale to introduce the finished features its time for ccp to take a step back and consolidate what they have before pushing on with the new features which more than likely will be introduced in a half arsed manner as seems to be the case over the last couple of years and each expansion is even more half arsed than the last i would hope that ccps senior read ceo personnel would have the respect to at least visit the next csm meeting in person once per year if only to get a feel for how the player base feels about things rather than relying on 2nd and 3rd hand information from people that will say everything is ok when its not which based on one of the dev blogs seems to be the perception in the organisationhopefully this threadnaught is being read by the ccp senior execs and they start to grasp how the player base feels finally can the csm push for a fanfest meet the ceo open floor discussion with the fans so that we can let him know what we feel
i support efforts to fiximprove old features can we have a patch where the old features just get updated without introducing all these 12 finished new features

ok ive read this thread and the csm proposal trying to get a handle on why the learning skills are so despised and adored in equal measure also trying to discover what ccp wants to do with the attributes that they affect do they want to speed up or slow down training times that is after all what they do and all they dofirstly i want to say thisthe achilles heel of every rpg since dd of the 70s is the stats why anyone thinks eve should be immune is beyond me the fact is ccps use of the atts is inspired you may have 30 for perception doesnt mean you can hit anything but you can train up frigate 5 in a weekrighto onto my conclusionsif new players are being turned off the game because they perceive they must train learning skills just to compete this has to be addressed new players are the lifeblood of eve and when dust launches it is going to bring in a host of new players coming from that platform into ours as an old player and a supporter of learning skills i have advised all my mates to train up learning to basic 4 adv 3 i havent had any negative feedback from them but as they saw the training time drop for skills they did want they were happyif they are removed then the new baseline for all stats should be around 2022 this will give some real meaning to the attributes as well as allowing for some serious specialising through the remap feature i suspect that virtually everybody will at some point end up with charisma of 5 making us all butt ugly antisocial and borderline sociopaths and i play this game to get away from realityi hope you guys notice the lack of flamage between this post and my first

empire mag sites could certainly do with a little loveno one wants them to be iskprinting machines but providing rewards more in line with those obtainable from equivalent radar sites wouldnt be too much to askafter all theres plenty of highsec ded sites static and otherwise that will provide rewards way in excess of these for only fractionally more effort
nullsec mag sites are right on par with nullsec radars and usualy better
concerning high sec i would say for grav sites orientate on the market valuewith omber beeing worth nothing i dont want to search for those make it plag or whatever is the best and second best ore in high sec at the time plus the pocket should be as big as about 50 of breaking their will

yeah the umpteenth time is the charmjust look at the first 15 items in your list they have been pushed by the csm and players again and againthis is just more of the same crapheres the listcool its in the backlog nowkthxbaithe only thing this will achieve is 1 make very clear how many issues were left untouched again2 get some great statement about how ccp are really committed to excellence and do everything they can to improve the game again3 not change anything again
in all that list ive seen no reference to a shiptpye even more horribad than afs and dessies combined  the eafs they too need a serious revisit

csm meeting minutesit was mentioned by ccp that the data does not seem to support that polished quality sells better than new features this led to a discussion on the balance of customer acquisition through new features versus customer retention through quality and polish the csm also stressed the importance of goodwill and overall player satisfaction which is very hard to measure in statistics until players decide to quit the csm is concerned that players are losing faith and loyalty in ccp due previous expansions not living up to player expectations the csm and ccp agreed that expectation management can be improvedcsm remained unconvinced of ccps commitment to excellence even after nathans arguments were heardcsm minutes

i do appreciate your doing this but as currently set up i think this is a poor system to measure players desires heres why 20 is allot of votes it would be nice if we could use some votes for a few items that we would like to vote against otherwise the controversial items get pushed to the front and the fact that substantial number of players dont want that change is ignored you might say that csms have already voted the items into the que that is true but then why have this second round of priorities if it is not going to accurately reflect the players wishes some of the wikis dont even have a link to the thread where the players supposedly supported the proposal moreover this assumes that every player wants at least 20 items changed we can see this is clearly not the case those who want fewer changes but feel more strongly about them cant reflect that if you only vote for one thing and because you think that one change is the most important it will still be recorded as if its only one of 20 things that you want which of course is not accurate had the votes been weighted to better represent the players wishes i would have voted for only 3 or 4 things but since those votes will automatically be diluted to 120th of my wishes anyway i added a few more i imagine i am not the only onei would recommend that if we are going to do this we do it right so we get an accurate picture of what players want im not sure this is very useful otherwise it is also sort of changing the rules mid stream we were under the impression that if an idea got voted in then it would go to ccp and they would prioritize it its obvious they have pretty much just ignored everything and we have to represent things but if you are going to do that at least do it in a way that doesnt have obvious inaccuracies in how it reflects the players viewsthe fix is easy it would be much better if every vote was weighted from the first vote not just after 20 moreover you should be able to vote against ideas

the list is quite a mixed bag of things from cosmetics to global things which left me wondering for instance about big issues like the excellence proposal being in the backlog as its hardly something you assign a scrum team to do and have it done after a certain amount of timethe list contains duplicate proposals and some that could easily be grouped for instance a bookmark omnibus proposal there are also proposals which are explained worsein less detail in the wiki than how they were presented in the often multiple ah threads even supposing ccp started implementing the csm items in the backlog this is a potential source for problems for the quality of the implementation the community often refines ideas after they have been brought up by csm but backlogged items are completely static and out of reach items brought up by the first csms might not even be relevant anymore but theyre still thereanyway my picksaineko macx1722333435406786100108111167194535141141367

shasis pick 34eve was so good during the delve 2 war early 2009 with almost no lag during large fleet battles
your analysis to that conclusion is fatally flawedyou are forgetting that since the players know the system is set up so that your one vote will not get more priority than counting it as one of 20 people will pick allot of things they otherwise wouldnt you are now trying to use those extra votes as proof everyone wants about 20 changes anyway so it doesnt matter i think thats highly unlikely like i said if the votes were properly weighted from the first vote i would not have picked 10 items i would have picked 3 or 4 and indeed if you do not change this i will pick 10 more items  not because i care about them in the least  but because i would like them to get bumped above other things that i dont like which is the other problem with this method substantial dissent in the player base is completely ignored at least with the assembly hall threads ccp and the csm would have some idea that many people thought the idea was bad here there is nothing like that controversial items get voted highly even though overall the supporters may be fewer than those who are affirmatively against it the only way you can compare these results with a poll where the players views are accurately weighed is to have a different poll that weighs the players views accurately  and then compare as far as all voting for excellence  thats their view thats their view why try to purposely conceal that your statement that csm is going to actually use this to gauge the priorities of what they push despite it being inaccurate is concerning why not do something where you get an accurate picture of the players views like i said the fix is easy

why not to bump with so many supporties
fw is already blobby dont need to get blobby in high sec with the broken ass war dec mechanics
api improvements yesspacebook hell yes
want pop a blob take a bigger one simples this is not a single player gamedid that answer your questionive no idea why your so fixated on our kb it has nothing to do with the topic in hand then again that appears to be what you do in any thread you disagree with why dont you man up and admit you dislike this idea because it will have a negative affect on you
ty for that argument because u just proved my point when it leads to a how profitable it would be to split the rewards with the huge blob cause its not enough to even bother and b how practical it would be for ppl with reallife obligations to even attempt this profession without this huge blobits suicide thats definitely what low sec needs another incentive to blob then again we all know u were not aiming to make low sec bounty hunting accessible practical profitable or worthwhile at all cause that would indeed have a negative effect on u and your corp and for some reason what if they do bring a bigger blob to counter yours u dock afk and pull out your mining alt trying to hide in 100 safety wasting their time thats what i thought fyi ure the one who mentioned looking at your fudged killboard in the first place or did u already forget in ignorance and fyi having your corp founder lie on your behalf about your killboard and get caught doing it does not reflect well on u let alone your corp so why dont u man up and admit that ure only pushing your proposal because in actuality it would not have a negative effect on u or your corp
sighhere we go againdeviating from the topic at hand in desperation i bought up the killboard originally to show you that i have not been suicide ganked thats all this was a few posts ago when you were trying to show that this was a nerf to your favourite activityyour comments are not bringing anything constructive to this thread at all end of story i have tried to answer your concerns but frankly you have yet to raise a single one that is relevant to the topic in hand i will let neo comment further on your inability to read a kb that should be a good laughtbh what our corp does and does not do has nothing to do with the idea anyway it stands or falls on its merits so far your the only person to object to the idea and im betting most people will see right through your argumentor should i say tears
once again u brought the killboard up in the first place in relation to the thread so im responding to it if anyones trying to deviate from the topic in desperation its a your corp founder for bringing it up again and b u since in your ignorance u refuse to answer the arguments against your proposal tbh what your corp does is prove that your proposal will have no effect on low sec bounty hunting and thats why other ppl have objected to it but of course u remain blissfully ignorant as usual go ahead and ignore them but once again dont be surprised when your proposal just sits here and collects space dust your ignorance your loss your faultps dont forget to spam that report button some more like u always do before u cry your own tears oh wait
this is the nature of eve  blobs are blobs however if you want an answer its worth noting that given you are singling out pirate blobs on the assumption these are real pirates then they will carry a security status rating of below 50 this means they are flashy and by implication you are free to take your own gang to deal with the adds if your complaining about blobs in general play then thats a different conversation and respectfully i say youre playing the wrong game star trek online has balanced pvp sides i suggest you check it out this idea guards against people using suicide tactics and then running away to rat sec back up at least empire would be more difficult for themi really really really dont know where you are looking but when i look at damts board it is api verified for kills yours on the other hand is not well at least were your hulk ganks are concerned your other alliance mates seem to have no issues using a verified api feed why is it a problem for you you are trolling and youre a fail troll i dont even know why i am bothering to feed you merin is that you so hang on our board has the marker for api verified on almost all the kills over the last month and i am lying fail troll is fail anyone with half a brain can see you are simply derailing the topic with zero data to back up your comments protip go to your killboard fail alliance or whatever you are called  you use evekill same as us click on the last 3 kills in separate windows you will see that your miner gank is not api verified and johivan clauses kill is and i am a lier if i am telling lies you are in need of spectaclesbe honest the reason you are angry about this is because you spend all your time if your none api verified killboard is to be believed suiciding miners in essence only 15 of your 80 kills are against none miners you are concerned that if a miner is able to sell or somehow facilitate his kill rights moving to someone with teeth you will be found out  your gravy train of fun will end and you might actually have to start caring about risk and reward beyond will my insurance pay for thiswe as a corp sometimes do suicide gank usually we do this between infiltrations of corps and other scams frankly id welcome the people we wrong being able to sell the rights to kill us  it would make our lives more interesting its actually better for us right now last week pindle had a 50 mill bounty put on his head  its like the person that applied the bounty actually wanted to give us 50 million how sensible is that as a system its notyou are a troll sir and a terrible one at that ban 2008s tbh
annathere is a reason your getting reported and your posts blocked that reason is they are troll posts and the forum moderators agree with me but i suppose they are wrong as welltry and put your argument in a concise manner if you can our corp and its activities has nothing to do with the proposal at allargue against it properly or not at all
1 and the blobs r what breaks this proposal all ure doing is adding a miniscule incentive to take them on2 qftsuicide gank whineits because ure trying to derail the topic at hand something u and gal r accusing me of btw i use battleclinic in addition to evekill should have no problem submitting your api there too especially since 20ish api checks can be viewed at the same time and u think thats somehow less honorable from blobbing everything in low sec heres the thingif the exhumer kills were really fake then i wouldnt care about suicide gank nerfs in the first place and u r concerned that your gravy train of free isk behind the safety of high sec isnt 100 safe when u cant avoid the consequences of hiding behind your alts when things arent going your way for your pirate main cant fight back with your alt then either train him to do so or deal with the consequences of hiding behind a weak charand replacing this system with another broken one is sensible its not either i liked how u say ban 2008s thoughit really helps your side out
lol i give up  idea supported thumbs up

for an auxiliary power core to be better than a rcu ii the ship need to have less than 6666 power grid and by that i mean base power grid with engineering skill at level 0thrasher and coercer have more than 6666 while catalyst and cormorant have less on first ones use rcu ii and on the other two use micro auxiliary power corehope that clarifies the issue
and you gain a cool 2 grid with decent skills now if you are that short its good but since with a mapc you can normally fit them unless you try to put things at random id say that the additional cpu the rcu2 requires is much more important than the 2 grid over the mapc and i never ever needed to fit a named mapc to any frigate i ever flew if the problem is you dont have enough fitting skills then dont complain on the module train those skills
this is just a thought mining crystals are colored differently depending on the ore in the pictures you load into the miners why not change the color of the beams to reflect those i dont imagine changing the colors of an already existing code would take more than 15 minutes but i dont know code either thoughts
just thought of a caveat maybe not bright blazing colors like the weaponized lasers but a hue added to the original strip miner beam animation

everything better than interceptors  everything better than frigates  higher dps than some afs  needs balanced killed a bunch of them solo in specifically fit t1 cruisers
half the ships dps comes from its drones and those can be removed easily they are not bonused in fact you should view the dramiel as the vagabond of frigates over average survivability with a specific list of targets if you want to counter and kill one instead of just chasing it away you need to force its pilot in an unfavourable situation by playing on his over confidenceif anything should be contested about it is how well this vagalike role scales within the ship class comparing the dramiel to other frigates is hard when the only viable t2 face to face combat frigates are the interceptorstldr adapt or die htfu etc
you can look at any pirate faction frigate dramiel succubus daredevil theyre all exceptional in certain fields dramiel is not special in that view a succubus or daredevil can beat a dramiel easily if they get a tackle daredevil is gallente style pure blasterdps succubus represents the amarrian way dpsneuts finally the dramiel is fast and agile like minmatar are supposed to be also pirate faction battleships like machariel vindicator bhaalgorn are alot stronger or have better boni than other ships of that class they all have their special field theyre good at blasterdps neuts webs speed and agilitywe can also play this game with vigilants cynabals ashimmus for pirate faction cruisers its exactly the same those pirateships are just better than their common counterparts they have higher boni more hitpoints more fitting slots and more fitting resources to use the additional slots ccp stated shipquality in eve is like thist1 ships  navy faction ships  t2 ships  pirate faction shipsand thats it dramiels and nearly all other pirate ships fit in this sceme also the price reflects this if you pay 90 mill for a frigate 200 mill for a cruiser or 700800 mill for a bs it must be good and still if you fit a cheaper ship as a counter you can still beat dramiels and stuff its not like youre unvulnerable i dont understand why everybody wants to nerf dramielsmaybe ppl are angry they cant kill it with their crows and rifters
the problem is at the frigate level speed is by far the most important daredevils blaster dps cant compare to bigger ships dps neither can succubus small neuts compare to large neuts seriously whats the point they dont even track but dramiels forte speed obviously beats larger ships it just so happens that dramiels speciality is op when in frigate form while all other frigs are pointlessits not that dramiel cant be popped but rather that other frigs need a reason to exist and no small neuts and loldps out of small blasters dont cut it
forgot one the worm and its not terribly exceptional at anythingto the original comment about faction frigs being exceptional in certain fields why should a dramiel be able to tank dps and burn faster then intys at the same time it needs to be gimped so that you can make it great at one or two of the above not all threemongo
incarna is just a stupid little game giving cowardly stationhugging carebears something to do while being camped if theyre camped theyre not supposed to be enjoying it this is just ccp catering to carebears some more
thats one of the most ridiculous statements ive ever read
thumbs up to this post this explains it alland i myselfs cant await for incarna coming out it will be a completely new experience and just add more fun to the game therefor i dont support the proposal from the op
hahahahathe thypical rant coming from a bored and frustrated ganker and only on combat concentrated player waiting for their prey beeing that stupid to undock and filling your killboardeyy no thankssome peoples learned out from their experience so you can sit out there and wait until you get even more bored and frustrated while waiting floating infront a stationcarebears even if most of the meaning is insultive is a style to play the game and many peoples are proud beeing and performing carebears and never forget at some day the carebears may strike back 
qft its hard to say this wont hurt you at this point not only is incarnas diversion of resources putting back many worthwhile amendements refinements and fixes 18 months but you have no idea what impact having 20000 people sitting idle in a space bar shopping for a new amarrian holy hoodie playing quafe pong or bumping avatars in the minmatar gay rights league disco will have on the wider eve server performancemost peoples objection to incarna boils down to a failure to perceive what its going to add to their eve experience to wit internet spaceships and fear that in fact it will merely add to the stresses placed on the system  leading to a degradation in their game experiencenow if ccp came out and said hey were going make our own eve second life and bung it on an entirely seperate server so it has zero impact whatsoever on real eve and you dont ever have to interact with hermaphrodite amarrian furs wearing disco lights in the docking bay id be less opposed to incarna but they havent so i anticipate incarna drawing further resource away from the things i care about in eve and having a negative impact on fleet fight lag
i would be perfectly happy if incarna never happens but instead we get bug fixes for the next 18 months
you probably wouldnt be very few bug fixes or balance changes make it past this community without being whined about
incarna will be on a second server running next to the one with your precious spaceships on it if anything youll see a drop in lag when incarna arrives with there being less people in space
it could be like ww2 where the allies had an entire fake army which caused the germans to places units in areas where there was no threatcould be great for faction and 00 warefare holo skill 1 ship projected prelevel at level 5 you can have 5 ships orbit youyou will need to train for each type a ship like holo frigates and holo bc will be two different skills that need to be trainedjust another idea to make it harder
a similar idea has been thought of before check out rixx javixs blog post about the chameleon module over here maybe get in touch with him and his corpmate you could try to combine the two ideasso long as there are counters to the final product then ill be willing to support it
as soon as the holo ship or the ship using the holo device takes damage it two things could happen1 the ship turns back into its natural form 2 the ship will have a visual that looks like its try to switch back but the holo projectors have not taken enough damage to go offline

at the moment i find it silly that corp contracts have the same 2 weeks life expectancy of the public contracts many corps want to have buysell orders that appeal to the corp members alone for industry or ship replacement programs but having the same contract lifetime of the public contracts2 weeks makes it pretty bothersomethis is how i would like it to be lost your insert fleet ship here in a fleet fight buy another one for cheap straight off alliance contractsat the moment something like that is not convenient to set up at all due to the 14 day contract limit
issuer column in market browseradd a column in the market browser that shows the name of the issuer of each buy and sell order this simple and seemingly minor change would at best greatly deepen the gameplay of eve and at worst change nothing greater transparency would allow traders and manufacturers to better size up their competition and this could subsequently result in a lot of fun cartels for various products could be organizedbroken up wars could be declared against key competitors in attempt to hamper their operations etcedit grammar
if it is just about getting the names of the competition  you could just buysell a single item pretty easy works already doesnt require a single piece of work from ccp
this is true however that will only serve to give you the name of the person with the lowest sell or highest buy order at any one time and it is somewhat less viable for very highly priced items the key here is that this small change would generate new transparency
only if there are multiple orders for the same item in the same station for the other stations it works nicely
researching issuers by using singleitem transactions is not only limited to highest buylowest sell orders for single stations and only a handful of stations account for a huge proportion of eve item movement it only gives that information to the single individual who made those transactions an issuer column would make this information available to everyoneedit this is op and supporting my own idea
all im reading is someone crashed my market so i want to find out who and wardec them
i dont think this is a valuable addition to eve besides the whole point of scc is nondiscousure of personality
what will greater transperancy allow you to acheive it wont change who you can buy and sell from  the market will still function in exactly the same way so at best you can say oh i hate them im not buying that here and fly to another stationwoopdeedooas far as wardeccing your competition youll never get to a wardec to work against most of the high volume traders simply because they use dedicated trade alts who never undock youre welcome to wardec them but youre flushing isk down the toilet
on the contrary ive crashed a few small markets before and gotten a couple rage eve mails for it also the single item transaction that darius mclever mentions would be sufficient for me if what you say was the caseeh then why do you get the issuer names once transactions are completed or in all of the contract marketsthe transparency allows for another avenue of conflict to take place between the players players can do and should adjust what they manufacture and trade as the market shifts allowing everyone to know the identities of all issuers makes it easier for players to collaborate with each other andor screw each other in market activities merely knowing the number of individuals involved in a market or how large the entities they belong to are can effect tradingproduction decisions this is a closer approximation of real world markets and the robust and almost entirely playerdriven market in eve is one of its greatest accomplishments over other mmosalso like i said the worst that could happen is people would behave exactly the same as they do currently the best would be that the new information would make the game deeper

hell yes
hehyou do realize that absolutely nothing regarding poses is going to get throughthe whole system is broken ccp knows its broken and were stuck with the broken system for a year and a half
supporting 
year and a half optimistic arent we it will be that long minimum until the tide changes that change will likely be to expand incarna beyond the infancy it will be delivered in or any number of other things ccp wants to do not the players you could hope for real change in 2 years the soonestsupporting another idea ccp will put on the back burner out in the back by the volcanic ash they use to fertilize their spring flowers
absolutely supported
supported even though what hesays is probably right
ccp is deathly afraid of touching any pos related codes no point beating a dead horse this idea will soon join all the other pos related ones in the graveyard
just dropping this herenot that i dont support
hm an industry supercapital is not a bad idea now it would of course not be able to build capitals or supercapitals but it could be pretty good at building subcapital ships the cargo size of the ship would have to be made to neither reach or get over 1000000m3 though so that it retains the intent of ccp to not be able to haul freighters

heres a simple solution for test participation pl csm order all your naped pets to attend or threaten them with a true reset and the problem is solved you should get 5k participants at least
so you keep saying can you cite some examples or is this just prc doing a rather feeble everyone knows attempt to discredit themspecifically which of the proposals voted in by this csm are solely to do with their petty wants
everything in eve is pvp industry  pvptrading  pvpcombat  pvpforums  more often than not pvpit is the core driving force of the economy comparisons with other mmos dont cut it because there is nothing like eve no other mmo has an economy which models the real world so accurately it is driven by conflict at a variety of levels playing word games will not change this fact no amount of claiming that industry and mining are not about competing for limited resources is merely denying realitythe whole reason eve is eve is because of the competition and yes cooperation that occurs between players any attempt to remove that at any level will remove the thing that makes eve what it is if you dont want to play eve the solution is simple dont play eve dont argue for its destruction from withineve is pvp it is not necessarily combat however
didnt realise that the peoples republic of china had any interest in eve  you learn something new everyday but to the general crux of you post pretty much every one of them in this players humble opinion falls into the category of petty wants i know that in the 5 or so years i have played this game i have never experienced any of the issues that keep getting dragged out as reasons behind what is being put forward as issues lag aside and im obviously not alone in this view go through the assembly hall and all of the issues are lucky to get more than a smattering of people agreeing or even discussing it seriously  look at any issue and out of the 350000 odd current account holders of the game the highest level of concern elicits maybe 300 posts so if these are such big issues why is it that only a very very small  but apparently very very whiny  minority even bother to discuss itand if you want more proof  trebor posts a request for people to go through the current outstanding list of csm concerns  and in 3 days has gained only 70 indications of support and not many more actually bothered to even respond as an aside the guy is to be admired for persistence and with mynxee  they seem to be the only two actually trying to make csm work of this whole debacle these two are the only rays of sunshine and the only ones truly committed to making this work they are failing not through any fault of their own but more pften than not its through the support of idiots like that finnagain person sometimes though you cant choose your friendsbut back on topic lag issue aside  as this is the only really serious concern at present  even ccp havent really been that interested in the list of complaints if i was ccp i would just take every csm report ever written and just write htfu next to each bullet pointso why the lack of interest in the 320000 players who ignore the whole csm charade the answer is that these issues are all just manufactured by a small group of fanbois keen to push their own agendas to show the world ie each other just how big their epeens are it is seriously laughableyou keep asking for some sort of proof to validate claims that i and others make about why this is all just a pathetic waste of time well for proof you need look no further than at the current state of the whole csm process the current state of ccp promises to fix the issues that the csm keep raising adnauseum and the complete lack of faith in the player base in the current system of stellar managementface it aside from a very few dedicated people some very deranged and obsessive fanbois and one or two people at ccp the csm could pack up tomorrow and 99 of the player base would be none the wiser as to its passing
spotted prc shill driven utterly insane by the pressure of trying to argue for the game being without flaw and the csm being horrible as proven by the fact that csm wants to fix things and ccp is stonewalling them and nobody else can gather and voice player concerns which dont exist anyways because the game is perfect and without flaw
with all due respect first of all it isnt a proposal thus supports are irrelevant and secondly in the first 4 pages of the thread 108 people took the time to go through that 160 item list and enter their picksthe people who do take the time to contribute are going to influence csms prioritization the squeaky wheel gets the grease after all which means that if csm has any effect on ccp devtime allocations their petpeeves will be more likely to get addressed  and if csm has no influence you can bet csms like mynxee and myself will make this abundantly clear we were elected to be advocates for the players and we take that very seriouslyif ccp really considers csm to be a cynical pr exercise then the current council has clearly demonstrated that it is not costeffectivewhich is all the more reason for csmskeptics to support the efforts of the csm
i dont think anyone is advocating that a relatively new player be elected to the chairperson of the csm rather that there should be some consideration for the newer players of the game i think the confusion arose with the use of the word chairback on the topic though the complexities of the game are not some mystical thing that only the aged and wizened veterans can understand they are just game mechanics afterall and there is a lot of commonality in this game and other mmos i know from experience there are plenty of much more complex and intricate systems around than eve online to myself though to use this as an excuse for effectively excluding the majority of the player base is disheartening what is surprising and alarming though is that whilst there is a recognition from ccp and csm members themselves that the csm is struggling to gain recognition with the larger player base members of it as well as its advocates are at the same time arguing that it should not be actively looking at recruiting from a greater variety of the player baseif an attitude like this is adhered to all you gain is a continuing alienation of the players who the csm is supposed to be representing you may feel like you are doing them all a favor but they will see things as being completely the oppositei know people appreciate the work that you put into the mynxee and your attitudes to the player base as a whole  but it does seem to be lost of others within the csm as well as some of the more vocal participants on the forums
i agree with mynxee to be effective on the csm you need to have a proper and thorough understanding of the game and with eves complexity that can take a whilebut new player concerns are definately taken into account i know i have voted on issues one way or another based on how they would impact new pilots while im not a newbie anymore i do spend most of my ingame time interacting with new pilots in eve university 
agony also teach a fair number of newer players as well as older players who are just new to pvp that experience is vital when considering the impact of proposals
the discussion about turnout is a rabbit trail the bandwagon fallacy doesnt determine validity of anything let alone the impact of elected officials if anything those who dont vote arent effecting the nature of the csm theyre not displaying anything about the csm itself only peoples reaction to it if 5 people vote for the ceo of an organization for example that doesnt make his decisions impotent it merely removes their choice of selecting a representative for their vision for the firm the csm is the only playergroup that is guaranteed to have the ear of the developers and is able to craft cohesive and coherent proposals that reflect the communitys needs and desires if a large percentage of people refuse to make sure that candidates who reflect their views are on the csm then theyve only got themselves to blame if their views arent represented ont eh csm as it is this csm has at the very least focused attention on ccps bottlenecking and failure in vision and has enabled media attention to be focused on ccp which may be the only thing that can jolt them out of their cocoon at this point
minutes if anyones interested since apparently linking them is too hard for the secretaryoops wait i voted for the secretary much love
so if the player base who are supposed to be represented by this group think that the csm is joke and act towards it accordingly by ignoring its existence and ccp dont listen to a thing that the csm propose beyond offering an acknowledging nod of the head and some free booze this all somehow in your tiny brain makes it all legitimate and everything is right in the world and as to media attention  one article written in massively does not a media storm make  have a browse through all of the other mmo based media and you will hear barely a whisper on anything related to this beyond the standard ing in the forums so if this is to be a gauge of the csms abilities we better hope that someone doesnt drop a wet paper bag on their collective heads theyd suffocate before it could be removedstill if it wasnt for the csm and fanbois like yourself wed have nothing to laugh at on a daily basis
a summarized version would be nice but some of the stuff thats in there is intersting and worth checking the raw text for instancethe csm has their work cut out for them sov structure hitpoints really hopefully they can continue to exert pressure both directly and indirectly before the flurry of media attention unfortunately focused on fleet lag and not so much ccps disdain for polishing all of their features we had absolutely no traction hell before the summit and zulus blog post we didnt even know what was going on with ccp the csm has at least clarified it and the situation called down enough media attention that at the very least ccp realizes that theres a problem with the brand they have set up its a solid start
i was hoping to have the summary versions ready before linking all the minutes but in future i will link the raw logs in the interim there is quite a bit of discussion going on between ccp and csm right now which coupled with the company i work for being taken over has reduced the amount of evecsm time i have available trebor as vicesecretary offered to do the summary version of the minutes he did meeting 3 as well which once i have will be published and linked etcfor the moment the raw logs and voting summaries are available on the csm database which as designed is very quick and easy for me to update straight after the meetings pdf and wiki summaries will be linked from there and this thread once availableonce the work takeover is completed i will be unemployed for a while and thus will have plenty of time for csm work

thumbs down magno sites are fine in lownull sec ive gotten at least 9 intact armor plates off of them in the last month and a half not to mention the amount of other t2 salvage t2 rigging bpcs and the insane amount of salvage you can pull out of these sites op is complaining about high sec sites or op is doing it wrong take your pickexploration is one profession that needs very very little love
yeah theyre pretty terrible in a lot of lowsec as others have mentioned they can be ok in some regions because some t2 salvage particularly from bloodssanshas  intact armor plates and capacitor consoles nom nom nom is very raredear while other npcs have fewno high value salvage types serpentis sites in particular have basically no worthwhile dropsand then you get doublyscrewed if you liveexplore in gallente lowsec because of the lack of higherend ded plexes its 410s or nowt for you bucko

this is a great initiative working in an it space and having experience in application development i would like to just propose a number of suggestions1 review the existing list of items  a number of people already pointed out that some of the items seem to repeat or be very similar in nature so i would suggest consolidating them also a number of items seem to have already been addressed by ccp and may need to be removed this would have the benefit of the communitycsm not looking stupid and when submitting a list that has not been properly reviewed prior as well as taking some ownership on delivering ccp with the most meaningful information possible2 elaborate on the description of some issues  reading through the list i found that some issues are not clearly explained i personally was a bit confused on what the actual request was from personal expertise i found that delivering clear and simple requirements to vendorsdevelopers is crucial in the success of achieving the goal of requested development i personally believe this would reduce misinterpretation and result in ccps cleared understanding of what is being requested 3 categorise the items  im suggesting to categorise the items into the following categories to make it easier for both the players and ccp to clearly see the areas where the changes requested lie and hence be in a position to assign the right teamsa bug fixes  items which have been identifies as bugs ie elements in the game which do not behavework as was intendeddefined by ccpb rebalancing  items which require some changes to their attributes to be made for them to behavework as originally portrayedintended by ccpsc new ideas  items which require the implementation of new functionsfeature in the gamefrom ccp i would suggest the csm requests the following1 comeback with estimated effort required in implementing each item on the list categorised into the followinga easy  items which are relatively easy and simple to implement items which only require a single resource or a very small number of resources to implement ie such items are generally considered as quick winsb medium  items which require medium effort of implementation usually involves a small team of resources or one resources dedication for implementation such items usually require a bit more thinking and timec hard  items which require a significant amount of code rehashing or new code to be written such items generally might require a number of resources from various teams to work together to achieve the outcomes such items are usually lengthy and costly to implement2 comeback with a strategy in dealing with these items essentially its the priority from ccps perspective they think should be assigned to the items on the list i would categorise them in the following waya not happening  items which ccp does not want to implement at allb next patch  items which ccp could release in the next patch not expansion pack usually they are the easy quick wins itemsc next expansion pack  items which ccp could release in the new expansion pack maybe the starting point for all this work will actually be the expansion pack after the upcoming one since its might be too late in the development queue to add themd soon  well basically i dont see the point of breaking it down into any more detail as this is too far away in the development pipeline and ccps priorities might change by then but at least this way people can see which items are currently flagged as low priority and will be addressed some time in the future

teborthank you for the responses i appreciate your consideration of the points i made it should be obvious now that the original plan of getting votes in assembly hall and having csm vote was on its own next to worthless this extra step of having players tell ccp and csm what is really important to them might be the necessary extra step its for that reason that i think this step should be set up in the best way possiblemy proposal for the next time we do this would be to simply give everyone 20 points total they can assign them as they like to the issues they want im pretty sure you will see far less than 20 issues on average from each voter they would also be able to designate some or all of those 20 points as negatives i would just throw that out there as to your question of whether we should be able to vote negatives i think the answer is yes for several reasons including but not limited to1 the game has changed a proposal that may have been supported in the past may not be as important and indeed some may say is now harmful for example take the proposals to improve destroyers it was posted in assembly hall in june of 2009 at least a few players have recognized the apoc 15 rig changes august of 2009 were a indirect boost to destroyers they were also an indirect a nerf to bses and a buff to ships that were top in their rig class this was a buff to bcs at least relative to cruisers it was also pretty clearly an indirect boost to destroyers relative to t1 frigates and t2 firgates how is that so rigs give a percent increase so to the extent that you start out with a larger number you get more from each rig for the same price hence this change boosted destroyers relative to t1 hulls since tech 2 frigates only have 2 rig slots the rig changes were a buff to destroyers compared to them as well that may account for some of the responses that destroyers dont need a boost in the recent boost destroyers thread in assembly hall im not saying people thought it through this way but they may have realized there are a ton of thrashers  hence they must be good for something moreover there are a fair number of other destroyers  at least in low secso even if the actual proposal wasnt implemented the game has changed such that someone who may have voted for a destroyer boost in june of 2009 would not vote for one now and may even be against one now2 the original threads are sometimes not linked so you cant use them to see if there was substantial disagreement 3 moreover often if the thread is proposed by a csm it will get fast agreement from players for various reasons that i wont go into and then quickly get voted in at the next csm often some of the negative implications of the idea are never even discussed at that time but they may turn up later making people realize its a bad idea this method completely ignores that this happens 4 the previous methods were never intended to guage how much do players want or not want something before it wasnt part of the equation it either got sufficient thumbs ups from players whatever that may have meant and then csm or it didnt if we now want to start gauging the importance players put on an issue its not rational to completely ignore the fact that many players may hate certain ideas indeed by only counting the yays you may have things on your top 20 list that the majority of players do not want and feel very strongly that it will make eve worse if you never consider the nays your system may have this happen quite often thus your system will not represent the players view but instead misrepresent them i do think that csm must start giving ccp some more information about what players really want so i support your general idea here im just not sure whether the way you did it here will be more of a representation or a misrepresentation of what players want i just dont think there is anyway to tell that said i do i understand your practical concerns so understand your position on this time around i would ask that you consider these points in weighing the results and in deciding how you will ask for input from players in the future

you have pretty much described how the process is supposed to work were going to do the categorization and prioritization using player input as a guide and we hope ccp will give us the needed feedback and iterate the mostwanted ideas so we can get them implemented in the next expansionmynxee and i in particular intend to keep everyone updated on how the process is proceeding this is the first time csm has been a stakeholder and thus had any input into release planningwe will be providing our lists to john ccp diagoras and pUFFFDtur ccp xhagen this weekend john will be representing the csm in the actual meetingscearain thanks for your input  check your evemail grin

tamber told me shed kill me if i didnt say it me is sad now
linkageso now i cant make a link to my bounty hunting idea when someone suggests a bounty hunting idea in another thread two hours beforeyeah clearly me being a suicide gank victim is at work again that was sarcasm just in case your confused again suggesting i bumped this thread for any other reason is not based on anything other than wishful thinking on your partyou seem to be persisting under the constant delusion that anyone suggesting anything that might affect suicide ganking is a victimnot true in my case i just want to see a slightly less broken bounty system your argument is this 1 i have a miningcarebear alt that i wish to protect from highsec ganking2 i have a low sec pirate that wants more victims3 suggesting a change to the bounty system solves both problems at once cleverly disguised as a boost to the bounty systemok so lets examine this1 i dont but even if i do it is irrelevant to the topic in hand2 i do but to be honest have no real difficulty in finding targets since our 16 man corp is at war with an alliance of 1500 players in either case it is irrelevant to the topic at hand again3 since i have no argument with suiciding but i do want to see a bounty system working properly i can only say incorrect oh and that is also irrelevant to the topic at handi say again my own or my corps activitys have no bearing at all on this idea i know you love bringing it up to support your nonargument but you really need to get that into your headtry forming an argument that is not centred around what colour galvatines front room is this week or what galvatines had for his dinner this evening and you might get somewhere resorting to saying this is a bad idea because i have a grievance is fail and you know it i could very well throw this back the other way and say the only reason you dislike the idea is because all you ever do is suicide gank and anyone who does search on you can back that one uphere is your challenge write an objection to the idea without bringing my or my corps play style into it and if i cannot counter it i will delete the threadsimples
thread cleaned of trolling and offtopic posts please remain on topic and post in a constructive matter
cheerfor those that already noticed yes this is a rework of the swg bounty hunting systemthinking about that the target jedi had a lot to lose by getting killed perma death and with later patches loss of experience without such a penalty preventing exploitation of the bounty by the target or the hunter is impossibleim not for one second suggesting these need to be introduced but saying that what we have to aim for is a compromise where we make it as hard as possible to exploit without gimping other game mechanics in the process
good stuff
signed this region needs serious repair please hear us ccp
supported
supported on all points alts and char trading already allow ppl with bad rep to hide so i feel that bad names should be changeable the player gets what they want and ccp gets more cash just make it expensive to prevent abuse if needs be
i made a new topic with a similar proposal but failed to search for duplicate topics in any case reposting here to add some suggestions for how it might work either way i support the suggestion original postfrom this thread it appears theres a fair amount of interest in being able to change a characters name there are also valid concerns about the exploitability of name changes particularly in a highly social game where trust comes at a premium here are some suggestions for permitting name changes while preventing abusepermit a player to modify a characters name but1 limit the number of times each character can change their name perhaps to once a year or once a lifetime and2 charge the player for the service either with an account payment similar to portrait swaps an isk cost commensurate with the characters ageskill or through the use of a plexwhen a character changes their name1 the name change appears in their employment history2 anyone who has that character in their address book is sent notification3 any searches of the old name still turn up the character and4 forum posts show the previous name in parenthesis below the current namei think with these measures in place and with the usual moderation of bad names ccp can safely implement a change name feature
im against this though a possible compromise would involve characters being able to change their name but the original name still showing what yeah i know sounds counter intuitive in some mmos you can turn onoff levels of info if their old name was displayed say parenthetically beside their new name and said old name could never be removed then id be okay with this hiding the old name and therefore the history associated with that name behind windows and info buttons makes this a big no for me make their old name as transparent as their new name however and i could tentatively agree
this is actually false our corp was robbed about a year ago we ended up in the same alliance as the thief later on because we recognized his name in a fleet we were able to pass on what had happened if his name had been different we might have not noticed it isnt like people are constantly keeping tabs on thievesi would support name changes only if you could flag characters on a personalcorpalliance level with different tags scammer thief loot thief etc if you could tag people you would be able to quickly identify a character even if they had a name changeas to the idea that putting an aka insert old name after the new name you need only look back to solodrakbansolodrakbanso name to see how someone could create such a long string that their old name might not be noticed
fairly self explanatory cruiser rats in 05 and 06 with appropriate bounties loot etc just to add a little more flavordifficulty to high sec rats
i just want to know who share the following linei want eve as a spaceship game and i will nor play dust 514 nor accept any interaction with dust 514 players on my eve game time
youre not missing much
i disagree in my view it could greatly enrich the game but its hard to say considering the low amount on informations
i will likely play both
newsflash they never asked you to
then quit the game because your not going to have much choicecan i has your stuff
this really its hard to be enthusiastic in a vacuum
half the reason i signed on to play eve was because of dust514 dust514 will bring more players to eve and eve players wont be forced to interact with dust players so winwin i think so
its console only how do you play a fps without mouse frustrating just thinking about it
i was going to troll you but i actually agree with you although ive seen some kids playing halo and let me tell ya they use those controls with surgical precision i guess im just getting old
dust514 is a very interesting idea and i applaud anything video game companies do to try to create new genres or new exciting ways to playing existing genres instead of remaking the same game over and over againccp has already stated that dust514 can be completely separate from eve if needed so i dont see why you are so bitter
im all thumbs i know what you mean though i used to hate consoles but increasingly all the nonmmo games were coming out on consoles and i eventually caved in it isnt the best way to do an fps but i have accommodated it isnt quite as fluid as im used to on a computer but it helps tremendously
in spaceno one can hear you qqjust sayin
qq moar
now i know what the prob was with them in high sec b4 but its a simple solution if the wanna suicide or whatever uber concord just kills them becase trying to kill lrg ecm to the hilt poss is a pain so why not let caps back in make ppl wanna actually buy and fly them more so can this be brought to ccps attention 
dreads are so needed in high sec
almost impossible to destroy alarge pos in high sec when there a load ecms jammers its a real disadvantage for even a big alliance or big corp to even attack this kind of setup so war targets stay in bubble and wait enemy ships to pop waiting there doing nothing so how the  you can destroy this kind of setup bringing 100 bs fleet in high sec sounds ridiculous
chribba is that you
npc corp alts in remote rep logistic are bad enough now you want npc corp alts in triage carriers
hope i was but i would guess he would like that too
the last thing high sec needs is cap fights in jita or mass afk l4 grinding in carriersmoros
if they allowed caps in high sec for movement purposes only id be ok with it anything combat related no mining is okget a nyx and go mine a belt
the machariel is slower than a selfrespecting ab frig whereas a vindicator does far better dps than any other subcapital by your logic does this mean that the vindicator is better than a machariel because its bonuses fit in well with its ship class
machs speed does not make all other bs obsolete dramiels speed along with lack of weakness makes it flat out better than any other frig in such a way that they have no reason to exist
so now its the speed yes speed is one key value for frigates the dramiel is an angel minmatargallentepirate faction frigate with a very high price tag its must be the best ship in this field following this definitionlets see how the mwd speed situation is with like 3 overdrives no overheatt1 frig like rifter around 3500 mst2 interceptor claw around 5500 mspirate frig dramiel around 7500 msvalues might differ a bit but not much thats how its is from every shipclass to the next best is a difference of about 2000ms for me it looks logical for the expense of 8090 million you have to be faster than a trashy 10 million intie of course you might state that other frigs are pointless then but this is not the case following that logic would also mean that all bs beside pirate bs are unneccesary since those pirate faction bs perfom better than standard bs but obviously thats not the case since not everyone can expense the isk regularlysame for dramiels its a superior toy for alot of money it will never replace interceptors also dramiel isnt really better in all fields than a ceptor interceptors have a better tackling range shipbonusand alot more warpspeed so if you want to intercept a hostile gang intie is still better and now stop whining just pay the price and buy a pirate frig nerfing this ships would make them pointless remember how silly faction frigs where in the pastthere was no market since they were just not good enough for their price now ccp buffed them to fit in their sceme again and everybody wants to nerf it this makes no sense
not supported dramiel is fine
not supporteddramiel is a extremly expensive angel ship since its mainly minmatar and secondary gallente it should focus speed and damage for this crazy price and the amount of skills you need it must be faster than an average ceptor worth 19th of a dram everything else makes no sense
no wardecs in empire space 07 and above  this is purely griefing  this is only legit if the war is declared mutualim a 4 year old player and its annoying let the pirates flame at this time

pve games in eve you consent to pvp the moment you login
enough said
care to reference that that isnt even the point there are seventy devs working on something that isnt going to add to the core gameplay of eve it will be basically a minigame that took three years plus to make at the expense of what eve really is there are a lot of ed off pilots that found out there are no incoming fixes for already implemented features for at least eighteen months probably much closer to two years because what do you think is going to happen when incarna is released think its not going to require some tweaking
i have yet to see anything that ccp does go through without a complaint in fact every year that incarna hasnt come out has been met with threads demanding incarna now there are threads against incarna dont try to speak for everyone

thank you ccp for disconnecting me from the server without so much as an email to remind me my sub was about to expire i know its my own responsibility to make sure im paid up but a little something would be nice especially since i just paid for a second account 2 weeks ago this is why i lost track of my sub timei get a mail every hour to remind me that my pos is about to run out of fuel im just saying maybe one mail 48 hours before my account is gonna be cut off would be nicenow if youll excuse me i have to go check paypal to see if i have enough to pay for another month cuz if i dont itll be a 5 day wait for a bank transfer
so you missed the note on the character selection screen that tells you that your account is about to expire
depending on your payment method you dont get a message i know you do for plex and dont for paypal i dont know about any other methods
yep its pretty dumb that they dont give you as much notice as they could to resubmaybe they could do it after you finish a particularly hard mission or flip some items in a station or win a 1v2  you know hey eve is awesome we know it you know it howabout throwing some bucks at ol ccp so you can play another month

hello rokkit kween i know we will have to agree to disagree here but you have written a very clear statement about everything in eve being pvp so i think it is useful to tease out some of the implications of what you appear to be saying as a way to identify some of the beliefs of pvp fundamentalism if you are not a fundamentalist i apologize and look forward to your clarification you begin by using pvp as a metaphor while pvp usually refers to pvp combat as opposed to pve combat you have adopted an expanded meaning that uses pvp to metaphorically describe all game mechanics and social interaction in eve pvp as a metaphor can be useful kresian for instance uses it to good effect as a way to discuss the interdependent ecology of eves combat industrial and other features as well as to emphasize the indispensable role of pvp combat and interpersonal competition while she and i view eve from different perspectives i agree with her on these points yet your use of this metaphor also conflates the meanings of pvpcombat competition and conflict as well as understates the importance of cooperation and amity in eve i cant think of any good reason to do this it dumbs down our language for talking about eve and thereby creates a less accurate understanding of the complexity and evolution of the eve universe next you imply that making reasonable distinctions is playing games with words well words are used to make distinctions and such distinctions are necessary if we are going to accurately describe eve i havent read anyone claiming that eve is not about pvp combat competition or conflict what i have read and what i believe myself is that eve is better understood as a sandbox that incorporates but is not reducible to those features honestly i am not trying to play games here im expressing a different view of what eve is now and what it should become in the future you move on to intimate that those of us who see eve as a sandbox with pvp  a cosmos  dont want to play eve and would destroy it from within that simply is not the case many of us enjoy playing eve whether we agree with your overuse of the pvp metaphor or not some of us such as myself find pvp to be our favourite activity and since eve is already a cosmos your worry about destroying the game from within is overblown we can develop further elements of this cosmos without sacrificing its pvp combat dimension finally you note that if we do not agree with your view of the game we should leave eve please do not make the mistake of assuming that only one view of the game has insight ive acknowledged the insight that the pvp metaphor can bring to the table even while pointing out its shortcomings wed have a better conversation on this topic if we were all committed to finding the insight in each others points of view delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
this is why the word sophomoric means like a wise foolnothing was a metaphor it was a statement of fact industry is pvp if you dont believe it try to truck down a freighter full of building materials and jump it gate to gate in a hostile region try to build capital ships in a region where the governing powers dont consent to your pos being there and trade is pvp as well try to take the materials youve produced to jita and see how long you stay at the lowest price without being 01d try manipulating the market and see if someone doesnt crash your profit margin take hundreds of millions in losses after you buy up a product and find someone shattering their own profit margin in order to substantially undercut you the babble about cooperation and amity in eve are somehow different from pvp is just more ignorant nonsense people working together to oppose other people working together hardly invalidates the fact that cooperation is one way to engage in pvp not somehow different from pvp if a group of people in team fortress ii work to take the enemys intelligence briefcase it doesnt mean that tf ii is no longer a pvp game and yes those of you who join a pvp game and then whine incessantly as to why it shouldnt be a pvp game really should go somewhere else wed laugh at someone who joined tf ii and then complained endlessly about how there was so much shooting going on same deal with eve judging by your massive 9 kills and 31 losses on battleclinic youve joined the greatest pvp mmo ever made in order to write sophomorelevel word salad about how eve should be a cosmos instead of what it is and what it was designed specifically and explicitly to be there are any number of comoses out there in which youd be much happier and wouldnt have to advocate for any type of changes start with second life it seems to be more your speed
who is the prc by the way
so in short you cannot provide a single specific example to back up your accusation that the csm promote their own petty wants you could have just typed no instead of 300 words of flimflam and fallacy
two items from me this timemodify or remove learning skillsuser interface  big wins fan favorites and low hanging fruit
may i please ask csm members who will present the most wanted backlog issues 
those are all passed csm issues we will prioritize them this weekend as part of the ccp release planning process hopefully some of them will be allocated dev time
there is a thing to consider when you make a gift of something that thing becomes worthlessany attempt to boost lowsec must take this into account in my vision of lowsec it is the heaven of smugglers and pirates there should be no highsec highways between empires but more highse isles in a lowsec sea this would make interregional trading more difficult and thus more rewarding for those who are fit enough this could require having some lowsec areas cynojammed as empire otherwise the use of jumpfreighters would make the task too easy for those who can afford those ships on the other side pirates would have more opportunities to catch some fly of course this would not make lowsec much more populated it will just give a good reward to those who can get it while it will not give any reason to farm and harvest this spacei think that an idea could solve the problem ill post it in features and ideas discussionedit here is a proposal that will also make missions more dynamical
csm memberspersonally i feel its now your time you asked us about our needs in the backlog prioritywe are voting 2000 and you have a meetingi really hope that you all will consider our voice no matter what you personally thinks about each others or about the goodbad of what we asked forwaiting heavily on your meeting issue list an on the minutes of the next csm meeting to know about csm position in the customer to ccp relationshipthank youyeay
its not a matter of how often you do forums its a matter of how hard you do them
stop apologizing you big girlof course we knew exactly what was intended it was just too easy fun and needed to let an opportunity like that to do a inyourface of much of the csm present and past simply slide by in faked apathybut if you really want to take a lesson home from this instead of just taking it as us wanting to give the csms some painful kicks dont use a word like tool about a group of people instrument is not much betterquite apart from all the alternative meanings of tool there are the associations to things like physical tools and instruments lifeless objects which you have complete power over and have no will of their own nor any influence on the actions you force them to carry out to be used and put back on the shelf as needednot exactly flattering for something that is some kind of threeway crossbreed between a focus group a political lobby organization and a showponyyou will have to forgive if it sounds harsh but that is just because i care im not going to condemn the whole of the csm because some have been smart enough to shut up so there is nothing to judge but some have been a travesty others naive and novices really putting their boots in their mouthes even if they dont all realize it for the most blind tool get it now would be appropriate perhaps bordering on complimentnot that the dev participation is all that innocent from the hearsay

please do something to fix this aging issue ccp please
blaster range needs to be improved to around 2030kmwith speed being the norm getting in range and staying in range is a major issue and more leeway is needed
ur dumb pulse range with blaster dps is stupid moar dmg not rng bro
apparently the drake and hulk are now amarr shipsalso che was a racist terrorist ghandi was a racist sex fiend and mother teresa was a sadistic extremist who denied the ill comfort and treatment whilst hiding the financial details of her charity but please spout more crap
i absolutely endorse this proposal
not really supporting the specific idea but something must be done i agree that the stats on rails themselves appear to be ok but the ships that use them are lacking especially the caldari ones so either fix the ships or the weaponsedit whoah since i didnt read the whole 27 frakking pages i lost all that sexy math thrown around p nothing to add there liang basically got it right at least as long as that formula is accurate though the accuracy niche red speaks about is an interesting concept but really given how eve works that niche is basically filled by lower classes of weapons and due to the range on caldari ships and on t2 beam ammo the range isnt that much of an issue anymore in fact basically theres no need to use anything else beside lasers right now cept maybe when you need very high alpha while having few ships like anti bomber duty
damage on the rails needs to be improved especially for mediums and smalls
while i must agree the whole principle of learning skills to learn skills faster might seem redundant  it is a certain way to specialize as well not everyone values certain attributes the same way and might thus invest more skill points in certain attribute learning skills my charisma learning are still quite low for example  and it also adds a variation in skill priorities for people with shortrun perspectives and long run perspectives now a little idea i have thought of is maybe to make learning skills special skills  instead of being forced to train them the normal way why not give a possible alternative  like maybe miniinstantlearn skill books that would add skill points to a certain learning skill could be something purchasable through the lp store or rewarded from specific missions so instead of using your training time to train the learning skills instead of useful skills you could be training those learning skills the other way while using the training queue for more valuable skills now i admit this is may not be the best wellthought idea and there might be some issues i have overlooked 
not supported
learning skills are a waste of time and it is probably the single biggest contributor to new players not sticking around long enough to learn the game as soon as you tell them how much time they have to train in learning skills that dont allow them to get into ships faster they become disinterested remove the skills add in equivalent attributes and credit with faster training time

your facts r someones suggestion and the link from that thread to yoursnevertheless u still have not explained how to make your proposal work in low sec all uve done is address it only once with an impractical action brought on by wishful thinking and ever since uve been avoiding it altogther when macro exhumers r still infesting high sec and mineral prices r absolute  how would the current situation warrant a nerf to suicide ganking it doesnt so the only reason ppl want it that way is because they want to be 100 safe and of course thats why u used the slightly in slightly less broken because ull still be safe for obvious reasons 1 it is completely relevant either way because suicide ganking affects them just because u fail to see how the mechanics of eve affect each other doesnt mean it doesnt happen2 it coincides with your proposal so it is relevant just like any other thread that attempts to nerf others and buff oneself3 only its not gonna work properly in low sec and u know it after all what u say isnt necessarily the same as what u do thats why uve avoided that part of the argument almost completely and continuously question the relevance of any other argument that u cannot counter refer to 3 cause u really need to get that through your headrefer to 3 and i do actually kill in low sec and 00 if u actually did do a search or even easier actually listened to your corp founder so u cant throw it back cause ure wrong there as well
simple indeedso for the millionth timemake your proposal actually work against the low sec blobs with a practical strategy for the bounty hunters anyone in their right mind would know that sending a random player to a blob with a miniscule isk incentive is not gonna work notice i didnt mention u or your corp this timejust the low sec blobs in general despite the similaritiesso r u gonna actually answer it for once with something practical or r u just gonna deem the same irrefutable argument irrelevant again and continue bumping your thread hoping it will somehow pass by the quantity of posts alone but we all already know the answer to that ps in case u didnt notice your posts also were deleted for trolling as a little taste of your own medicinejust a reminder that ccp is only doing their job which does not involve silencing the opposition for u

sifting through the normal tripe we finally have a pointok lets try and answer this one with a couple of pointsquestions and some suggestions1 it would be impractical and unfair to provide any kind of boost to the hunter when hunting in low sec2 recognising that lownull sec hunting is actually more difficultriskyso while we cant fairly change the game mechanics to make hunting low sec targets easier we should recognise that they are more difficult and reward accordinglyhow about applying a modifier to the reward based on the sec rating of the system where the kill is with a negative modifier for high sec and a positive for low sec
now ure the one trolling 1 once again and exactly how fair and practical is it when he has to face everyone else just to get to his target and survive all for a ty reward2 u noticed huh then u should also know that no amount of added rewards would ever encourage a bounty hunter to commit suicide especially since none of the rewards apply unless its actually completedtry to actually give it an ounce of thought for onceif normal players wont be farmed for free what makes u think a bounty hunter would waste all his time getting farmed for chump change r u picking up on your total lack of logic on this or r u just complacent with a socalled slightly less broken system to waste ccps time with
so basically your saying that killing any one given pirateoutlawwantedbountied target in lowsec is always impossible as a single playersorry i dont think that is the case patience and cunning may be or will be required but to say it is impossible is simply incorrect remember me saying that the idea came from the swg system ask any bounty hunter that tried it your target was nearly always a lot stronger than you and extreme planningcunning was required to hit your mark also bear in mind that the mark had a lot to lose by getting pwned so was always paranoid and on the defensivepeople still enjoyed it and granted its not going to be everyones cup of tea then again the same could be said of many aspects of this game even if you took away the agent idea and kept the tradable rights it would be a lot of fun for those that were willing to take on the risk

since minmatar ships are only held together by duct tape anyway i suggest a special rr mod for just this race a duct tape launcher that will be used for rr instead of the normal rr modules using duct tape rolls as ammo
suggestion heartily supported
10
bah always ragging on the minmatar however i support this
and janitors someone needs to apply the duct tape p
i fully support this idea
suported only if brand names of duct tape are used as variations on ammo sellotape  long range but sodall rep masking tape  short range but high rep etc
im not sure if this has been proposed before if it has i couldnt find itreduce standard belt ores volumes by 80  this still makes them viable for lowbies mining in frigate or their first mining barge the volume removed from them should be moved into belts that must be scanned down gravimetric site belts in every system the belt must be depleted before respawn aka all the ores not just the higher value onesessentially all the upgraded 00 system grav sites except appropriate for highsecthese belts would have tougher rats than the normal onesice belts in all systems would all be scan down and move once every few hours random 36 hoursexhumers and mining barges would have 20 cpu 1 pg and 1 high slotthe orca and the rorqual should probably get that too
i like your first idea with a few tweaks better than this one i would humbly ask you to modify it to include bs rats in low sec cruisers in 05  08 and frigs in 09  10also take the asteroids out of 09  100 and replace them with tiny tiny roids for the noob frig minersmacros would adapt in a scannable roid field world but good train of thought here
it occurs to me that the people at ccp understand fun about as well as a penguin understands a pogo stick or perhaps they are sadistic imps trying to recreate a bf skinner experiment on space nerds stop making me click for space cheese make pi fun or make it painless

yesthere is nothing left to say

nothere are far too many ways to escape penalties from your actions in game through the use of alts trial accounts boughttraded characters etc the bare minimum for any name change would be it does nothing to your standings combat logs kill rights etc and how they are setup with other players if a player has another in their watch list changing a name doesnt affect the watch list standings notes etc and there is clearly some history or aka attached to thembut the point is you everyone should be held responsible for their own character you made itbought it so you have to live with it i oppose character sellingtransfers i understand why people do it and why they might want it but it along with the ease of recycling alts making trials are all taken advantage of by those who know how to do it effectively changing your name just adds another layer to this stack of escape from consequences as not everyone or every system is going to track and keep the name changes up to date the game already has few real consequences that can be imposed on a player by others only if you can find them and catch them can you extract any revengejustice but only in so much as you can take what they put at risk one can easily turn a character into a station trader or turn on an alt if really hounded by other players which afaik rarely if ever happens i realize in many instances a character isnt tracked and hunted or banished by their identity but i think there should be more ways to make players aware of whowhat characters are about not less
anything you want to do that will completely sully your reputation you can do with a disposable alt scams disposable alt suicide ganking disposable alt corp spy disposable alt with the disposable i win button there is no reason not to allow very limited name changing this doesnt remove corporation history standings security status bounty or anything related to the characters true natureno reason not to support this i can walk down to the courthouse today and buy a name change
supported this is a stealth macromining nerfon a somewhat related note the bounty value on npcs should be dictated somewhat by the danger posed by other players not solely by the danger posed by the npc as now in other words the same rat in a highsec mission or belt should pay a lower bounty than the same rat in low or nullsec
supported good idea i agree with the point about macromining
i cant support it because while it would deter macrominers it would hurt legit miners a lot more it also would be a stealth lowsec nerf as cruiser spawns are really the only reason to bother with many 04 and 03 areas while battleships spawn its mostly cruisers and frigs even with a lower bounty the safety in hisec areas would be a strong drawthe only place i would support it would be in ice fields
not to mention the usual set of t2 medium drones that every exhumer has can easily kill the cruiser rats so unless theyre buffed up its not gonna work
absolutely supported
its trivial to equip a hulk to be able to tank rats now the t1 exhumers could need a slight buff
supported as i think there is a real need for this
great anti macro ideaat least the macros will have to be fitted with t2 or faction gear to perma tank the rats making them a nice gank target and not just for lols
as for macros wouldnt they just move to 07 and up might as well extend it up to 10
edit i would say also put them into ice belts
i say put bs in low sec cruisers in 05  08 and frigs in 09  10also take the asteroids out of 09  100 and replace them with tiny tiny roids for the noob frig miners
i would all so like to point out that cal ships have a higher sensor strength as well d do something  nurf the ships  nuf ecm  or boost eccms supported

proposal on a way to stacking penalise ecmfor every cycle you are jammed or every 10 seconds or we you gain some resistance lets say your crew starts fixing your bloody sensors or something this bonus decreases while your not jammed this way a ecm boat would still be able to jam alot but after a while youd break free and be able to do stuff for a while ecm boat can then swap to harrassing someone else while waitingprosno permajamecm boats require some more skillconsimplementation

i remember the good old days where people used to fly them scary blasterthrons in low sec
this idea really scares me because it will end up me using neutsusceptible lasers and ridiculous amounts of capshot while blasters get the same rangeyou have the best dps you have barely any cap usage dont kid yourselvesthe megathron is still a favorite of many pilots because battleships dont need to get into range because they usually warp in at range due to a frigate recon etc tackling
this is definitely not what needs to be done
blasters are quite bad now but the fault does not lie with the weapon to deliver your dps you have to get really close to your enemy and its nigh impossible to do that right now by the time you get to your enemy youre dead if you get there at all because of scrams webs and other ships being faster blaster boats need the ability to close distance much better than they do now how that should be done is yet to be figured out right now equipping blasters is like a boxer having trex armsessentially the weapon itself is fine its just that you cant use itabout rails i dont know much about them except that id like the firing animation to be more attractive
like all of us when i began scanning i only do it on certain regions with flashy colors as its way easier to see all probes with this type of backgroundadding an option to reset camera on probe x would also be useful

i dont see destroyers as needing much of a boost as a class afs could use something as they cost considerably more than a destroyer but on the whole i think frigate class ships are pretty well balanced and the thrasher may be a bit op im certainly seeing more thrashers around than any t2 frig  ceptor or af but then again im flying around fw space and dessies unlike t2 frigs can go in a minor plex i dont think that explains it all though
i will not buy a console also ever since playing ut99 competitively i refuse to play fps with a joypadthumbstickthat being said the interaction between eve and dust could potentially be a good thing at least during the ephemeral lifespan of dust
although im not happy that resources and manpower have been diverted from the basic eve for dust and incarna i am looking forward to the addition of dust 514 ive essentially been a computeronly player all of my life but i finally broke down and purchased an xbox 360 this past winter specifically for dust ive been practicing with codmw  mw2 and a few others so im confident ill be able to hold my own when dust is released and no im not a kid  im old as dirtas stated by others if you arent interested in dust just dont use the interaction  no one is forcing you to  but i think it will add a new dimension to eve that should bring more players into the fold im just hoping that eventually with the addition of incarna players from both games will be able to interact in ways beyond just the text communications such as dust players coming up to stations and pilots being able to go to planetbased areas well just have to wait and see what developes
i was excited bout dust right up until i heard it would be on a console makes me wonder what passes for brains at ccp wont buy it wont recommend it will find ways to grief it out of eve
i know this topic has been discussed at great length throughout the community so i am going to do my best to combine what ive seen scattered across 300 posts and condense it into 1 meaningful and hopefully realistic post1 balance  insurance has been broken far too long with this due to the release of the new sovereignty system and furthermore by planetary interaction pi rebalance insurance costsrepayment to be better suited to a recreated market2 criminal acts  insurance should not be paid out to those who lose their ship in the process of a criminal act either by a player concord stationgate guns3 wars  again insurance should not be paid out during a war i dont see geico insuring destroyers in the middle east kind of idea4 haulers  haulers would like to be able to purchase additional insurance to protect the cost of their cargo especially important for those who do hauling as a business5 alliance insurance  make it so an alliance can insure a ship for a playerthat is all  i stayed away from politics fingerpointing etc intentionally yes all of these have been mentioned before but are spread over 300 posts so this is a condensed version for the ease of ccpcsm to see it and hopefully address itthanksmarcus covinus
maybe you havent noticed but this has already been implemented insurance costs are now supposedly realigned automatically every month or so based on the market mineral pricesyoull find some support with this idea however ccp has stated that it is hesitant to do so on the basis that newbies make many mistakesfor me personally i feel it would severely restrict combat in lowsec as one party or another will have to go gcc for any engagement to happen and its hard enough to get people to commit to a fight without having them factor in insurance as well ie less brawls and more skirmishing this is by far one of the best stealth nerfwardecs idea i have seen to date 1 internets for your originality and roundabout fashioni could get behind this idea it might even tone down the suicide ganking whines a bit maybe notcorrect me if im wrong but i believe that corps can already do this overall some good ideas many less so so im going to go withnot supported
what if hes 5 but doesnt have gcc atm which brings this tofixed
1 payout is already fluid change already made although not as much as could be and not region specific2 that would destroy lowsec pvp canceling insurance for concord kills and at most sentry kills should be more than enough3 why not by the same concept no pvp ships should be insured because theyre likely to get popped eve insurance is just game mechanic to make pvp less walletbreaking not to be compared to irl insurance4 too much room for exploitation5 they can always reimburse you for it
i must agree that paying an insurance to a pirate who got himself killed seems a bit silly but there could be more fun ways to make the insurance of pirates less lucrative than by simply removing it i actually came up with two ideasaadd a new insurance clause which would basically cost 510 of the price of your current insurance and this clause would be necessary for you to be insured in the two cases you describedb this one is mainly focused on the criminal acts part  what about making security status affect the insurance price maybe something like 1 or 2 per sec level  like this pirates will see their insurance become more expensivebut maybe im too creative  i would also like to add the total removal of insurances during criminal acts and alliance wars might deter people from pvping a lot 
i would support insurance removal for concord kills but certainly not for anything that caused a gcc as others have mentioned you would really screw lowsec pvp1 it was fixed2 see above3 no4 be more careful also see above removal of concordokken payouts would promote more careful target selection among suiciders5 probably not all that necessary just transfer isk if they really want to do that
u mad
invincible macrominers
no thanks
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha roflyoure playing the game backwards my friendgo to 00 problem solvedyoure already shooting poss youre at war with so therell be little difference
didnt think about that but i doubt a macro at this point in time has the skills to fly a cap ship
coughsonlytakes6or7monthsofspecialtytrainingcoughs
you guys both have it wrong you dont need a macro with a dread you have a giant cargo hold to mine into highsec dreads used to be able to mine nonstop for hours afk
then i still want a nyx in high sec so i can mine non stop you just cant dock
hear me outwhat if we could target specific systems in a shipbe able to disable communications be able to disable propulsion systems or weapons systemsyes i know you could still use ts or ventrillo but if you disable comms then you wouldnt be able to warp to corpie without probing him out or somethingitd be nice if we could target a heavy dps dealer and destroy its weapon systems to level the playing field a bit and allow for engagements to last longerthis would probably encourage more ransoms as some pirates once comms are disabled have more time to negotiate a ransom if ships became harder to kill and lasted long enough to disable other ships systems players would be more inclined to getting into more battlesinstead of replacing ships often you replace broken and destroyed systemsjust thinking out loudbegin the flames
because eve pvp is about the size of the blob not intelligent tacticswhat id rather see is an fof scrambler that breaks up all fleets paint everyone with red aggro and reset drone aggro
this is an idea that has been brought up before i believe one such thread even got a dev response stating something to the effect that he liked the idea very much but that there were technical limitations on implementing ityoull find this idea right up there in popularity with line of sight firing and keyboard control for ships
already in the backlog vote for issue 99 in the backlog priorization thread
yeah there are but thats not the pointpoint is that its the best frigate even faction and no one considers buying the others because the dramiel outperforms it
see my post higher up a taranis is capable of doing it
im not sure where you are flying but not only are other frigates considered they are purchased and flown i see lots of other frigates i rarely fly the dramiel either becasue it has little in the way of surprise value there is really only one way maybe 2 i would fit it and it is the common way people used to not understand the ship so lots of pilots in them got tons of easy kills those days are over for the most part plus it costs way too much  not only the hull but the optimal fittings which are required to really make it shine if you end up with a scram and 2 webs on you your going down fast im not saying i would never fly one but there are several other ships in the frigate class i want to try first
lol
i agreed npc corps should be wardeccable

what you describe is a gift to pirates send them the haulerstraders for them to shoot up as they attempt to pass throughthe game play style of sitting in lowsec to pounce on people is fine but what makes those people think anyone wants to play mouse to their cat the fact that lowsec needs a boost is evidence that people arent by and large interested in being their victims at best they might hope for some interlopers who go down there to fight and might end up getting bashed on by all the locals who lay in wait for that juicy mission runner who thought they could get inout or the like minded haulerexplorer i dont have all the answers but i think a lowsec that caters to small scale pvp through some mechanics would offer a better future for lowsec than trying to pack buffalo in a pen for the mighty warriors to hunt
this kind of suggestion miss a critical point the rate of success and the numbers of the predators in low sec is too high to sustain a healthy ecology ie to have a thriving low sec population in rl the success rate of predators hunts is 2030 in eve terms it would mean that only 2030 of the attempted attacks not simply i have seen someone in systemwarping to the gate but actuali have locked him end fired on him should be successful instead of the current way higher percentage if you want a population in low sec beside that you are asking for a free meal force targets to me it can be fun for you but not for the target as you will try to have overwhelming forces ready to slaughter him simply too many people play pirates because it is cool making the profession a failure
you are just saying that it does not make sense to add an opportunity to lowsec because it would be a gift to pirates and so how would you fix lowsec you have to give something new to lowsec or take something old away from empire or 00 and give it to lowsec there are no other ways in ccp vision lowsec is the place for corporations who have the force and presence to camp the gates andor farm there the problem is that many lowsec system are too much populated and there is too much traffic for this to happen for example amamake will never be controlled by a small corporation even if a small corp can achieve some good results ammatar lowsec is far more quiet instead the success rate of predator hunts just depends on how strong or able the prey is right now there is no reward for the prey for being strong imagine you have the pilots to escort a freighter through lowsec why should you even bother to do it when you can just do jitaamarr with autopilot the fact is that the only reasons why you could want to bring some real force in lowsec are free pvp without political and economical consequences when you are fighting just for the sake of it without defendingconquering anythingfactional warfare even if there are almost no consequences for it so its like point 1 maybe access to lucrative lvl5 missions in my vision lowsec should be populated by groups of pilots that want power and economical rewards and are ready to kill for it right now if you want such things its far better and easier to go into npc 00 because lowsec is worthless apart from lvl5 missionsso my idea is a gift to pirates read this again then my proposal is a nerf to trading ease and thus a gift to the more organized tradersthe market is one of the biggest forces in eve if interregional trade is forced to go through lowsec it will be more populated and interregional trade will be more lucrative for those brave and fit enough my ideas is a htfu for the traders
sorry im late to the party here ive had precious little time for keeping up with the forums due to work and other rl stuffthere are some great and interesting ideas hereare you guys aware of my ideascale community for making low sec matter if youre not participating there yet i encourage you to check it out and add your ideas there its really a much better way than the forums to  let people weigh in on ideas and allow the best supported ones to become obvious i am going to be spending some few hours this weekend reading through commenting on and adding my own votes and ideas there hope to see you there
already in the backlog vote for issue 99 in the backlog priorization thread
flog it 
bumping this to the topand yeah i support this hands down come on ccp put aside the antics for getting new players and fix all the things in this game that are done halfway yes its a huge list but you got yourself into this mess in the first place
35k players in the cluster right now and i cant login im 300 in the queue surprise eve is still a broken piece of  with no sign from ccp that they care about their flagshiphaha it doesnt even give me any kind of message now it just sits on the authenticating screen
yup getting the same problem here guess ill go do something else for a while heck i was pretty much only on the forums to see if i could figure out why i couldnt connectstatus unknown
maybe the solution is one fixrebalancingshiny new ships expansion and one feature expansion every yearsince eve has become such a monstruous mix of code and lag this is the way to go or the game will dieanyway supported commit to quality over quantity  excellencealso dont forget to attend the mass testing guys interesting things are happening in sisi
yes please fix the core before you pile more things on top of it
2030km is to much but more range is right it needs to be double optimal then what it is right now 15km that would do two things first it puts the optimal right between projectials and pulses were it should be after that i would wait and see how that gos for a spelland yes optimal needs inc blasters are from the days gone by when bss could first go 1200km and from a second age were you could double web effectivalynow both thoughs days are gone i have more ideals after the optimal is inc but that should be the first step right there
6km blaster range is hilariously bad with am ammo 
id say 1 way to boost the rails is if they had medium dps medium alpha but were able to hit from much further ranges hten everything else currently this is semi true also rail guns should do mabye 5 damage penetration cause the rounds are moving at portions of the speed of light it prolly would go throw a sheild also railguns should do kentic and explosive damage not heat and kentic finally the rounds are way to big rail gun rounds can be a fraction of the size of a projectile round and still do the same damage now for blasters they need to do the most dps in game like 2x better than everything else they also should have a slight tracking bonus also blasters should do therm and kinetic damage cause there more likely plasma based they should still be extreme close rangeboth should only need to reload in 5 seconds cause they dont need as much caution as projectile rounds also they should have a kinda large cycle time cause both need a lot of energy to funchtion thats my 2isk
not supported i am all gunnery and drones railguns are fine blasters need fixed and no caldarie rail ships dont need more pg becouse there shield tanks gallent get more pg becouse are armor tanks suck more pg away from the rails then shield tanks aka thats why caldari have more cpu on there ships for that tank so they are already balnaced gank vers tank as they are
signed rails need a buff blasters need a uber buff and some gallente shipd coughdiemostcough need a light buff
not supported i dont see anything wrong with it if its not broken then leave it alone becouse we have a long list of things that are broken
dont play with it it works atm so if it aint broke dont try and fix it instead why not apply resources to fixing other problems
great solution simple and should make everyone happywhy has it not been done yet
learning skills were a completely ridiculous idea in the first place but now that im used to my training speeds if they were to drop i would be very annoyed at ccp for wasting my good newbietimes training these annoying ty skills unless the training was faster than it currently is

post with ur main  alt posting is highest level of fag0try it is bloby just in ur wet dreams and we are mot interested in highsec actually highsec s are interested in exploiting current mechanics
oh so very supported the click fest actually has me not logging in due to ugh i dont wanna deal with it
pi is probably the least labor intensive activity in eve and you want to make it easier having to spend 1015 minutes a day on a passive income too much to deal with hell if thats too much for you why not avail of the 5 day cycle better yet why not just leave pi for the ones that actually appreciate the income

anything that allows me to have a few rolls of duct tape in my cargo is supported d
this makes sense
supported provided it can also be used for seducing other pilots you know like when you go to the park at night dressed in black and wait beside the runners track in the bushes
i disagree with your assessment of what holds minmatar ships together so i will support this but only with these additional ummm additionsa paperclip autocannon with colorcoded ammo paperclips of small medium and large sizesa bubblegum drivejammer that blows a bubble around your target which stops all propulsion systems including afterburners and when finally popped leaves a sticky mass on all cameras effectively blinding the ship
in that case we should also get dynamic configuration of our shipswhenever our ship is damaged and is repaired the location of the fins or even the general makeup of the ship if it was badly damaged  into hull  should be altered afterall putting bits back with ducttape tends to change how something looks especially if you keep doing itanother point though when firing said duct tape at enemy ships it should be possible to lower their agility with it making thrusters and whatnot stuck int he same position making it harder for the enemy pilot to change directionsi also want a scrap cannon where i can use my own ship as ammo to fire at the enemyand since matari are supposed to be terrorists when do we get an exploding frigateor some kind of minmatar mod you put on a ship and when you activate it your ship explodes and everthign around you will get horrid damage like a 1 shot smartbomb or a stealthbmber bomb fired at point blank range this would also mean youd probably pod yourself while doing this ofcourse the upside being that you do massive damage to an enemy fleet around you
i use chewing gum and bailing wire your suggestion is unbalanced and biased towards duct tape users not supported
i use wd40 and do not support this proposal
nope go away please
supporting duct tape launchers for the silliest race in the game you do realise that most terrorist groups dont believe in killing themselves to achieve their aims right
youre forgetting something here capsuleers are immortalall that would happen was wed wake up in a medical bay without implants oh wait we knew we were goign to blow ourselves up so we arranged for a clone that didnt have any
actually my two proposals in concert would work better and your modification steals too much of lowsecs thunder
tbh lowsec doesnt really have thunderthats kind of the problem which csm is working to solve they are even writing a proposal to ccp on how they would improve low secmost systems are completely empty no fun
why is that everyone seems to want to punish the miners that actually put an effort into mining every solution like this to attack macros only punishes the miners that dont all ccp needs to do is flag accounts active for superhuman lengths of time and if someone is caught macroing ccp should 0 sp their ass and delete all their ingame assets first offense on the second offense a loss of 30 days game time and third permaban stiffen the penalty for macroing and soon enough macroers will just about cease to existwe all know their is no way possible that a player could sit there damn near 23 hours a day and not be a macro
because you havent the slightest idea what youre talking about this doesnt punish miners one little bit it makes them spend a few minutes probing down the belt just like those of us that mine in 00 do alreadythis only punishes those people to lazy to take 3 minutes to probe down an easytodetect grav sitesince you seem to think otherwise you surely are capable of backing that assertion up so how does making you spend a few minutes probing punish you it makes it much more difficult for macros
this would just force the macroer to actually play the game long enough to probe down the sites then all they have to do is bm the site macros win again
the basic idea isnt bad but there are problems with implementing it1 not really the asteroids would disappear in a very short time after dt and the newbies would have nothing to mine2 why only in high sec if you do that you should do it in all systems 3 we currently dont have moving belts because redrawing and reselecting a new locations for every asteroid in every belt ore even 80 of the high sec belts every few hours will use a lot of the server power if the sserver was to use several predefinite positions for the belts and cycle between them in a few daysweeks dedicate miners would have mapped them all and cycle between them till they find the set in useso ccp has removed your static belts instead of adding scannable asteroids fields plus the ability to add to the number of those with the mining upgrades cry more
macros cant work with 3d space camera moving and probe movingadjusting they will need a real person to probe belts 247 its not the same as scanning the screen looking for words actually physically moving objects probes trough 3d space isnt something 99 of the macros in the world can do they would need very high advanced ai to do so and that would cost the rmts a ton of money proof me wrong if i amthere for i support thisnewbies should just probe like everyone else then or do something else
noyou force newbies especially the clueless to probe out belts as all the static ones will be ate by macros and other lazy a punks in retrieverscovetorshulks in newbie starter systems just because you say the little static ore will remain for newbies doesnt make it so try playing the game moreyou basically destroy the usefulness of gsc setting up strings of them in belts for miners to mine into as they move along that is a basic tactic of players on their own those who dont have an orca etcforcing the roids to be depleted is another tactic of play how i want you to bad idea people may well move on to other in system sites or other systems over seeing their profit per hour drop to 12 or less mining the crap ore or you make it so only those in select time zones or no joblife can mine the good ore and the crap is left for everyone elseyou make the rats tougher so now the newer players and possibly regular mining barges cant cut it out there a retriever has crap slots covetor isnt much better who knows about a mining cruiser or frigate cause all the static ore was ate by previous players
thats funny and here i was thinking this was a multiplayer game
i like this ideamining becomes a little more of a thinking gamemacros wont be eliminated but the people running them have to put more effort in which makes it worth that much lessmore realistichisec and lowsec grav sites are currently uselessthe only drawback i can see is that it takes a bit more learning in order to mine but theres already a tutorial dedicated to scanning when players start the game
what is funny is how people selectively pick out one thing in a lame attempt to disregard every other ideapoint made that or they really arent capable of handling the act of reading comprehension so on seeing their trigger they respond
i support this on the condition that at least half of the belts can be scanned out with the dscanner
that would defeat the purpose macrominers would be able to macro that make them easy to scan down with the probes but make them require probes it doesnt take much to get ability to launch 4 probes
not supportedin particular i think the fitting for hulks is extremely wellbalanced if you want to afk while 3 battleships in nullsec wail on you youre gonna have to pay for some deadspace loot and youre going to need decent to good shield and cap skills as it should bethe real problem with the mineral market is macro miners lowbies mining in retrievers will never make jack until thats fixed though theyre never gonna be rich
t3 ships are created in wh with goods looted in wh and one of their main use is on whthe ability to change subsystem on a wh pos seems totally natural for me
supported oh yes
excellent idea supported
i can see where name changing should be allowed but very early in you subscription to the game suppose when joining eve you thought of a silly name just having a laugh not intending to stay you got char building and got to like the game to stay but the name is now niggling away at you but to start a new char would cost you two months of training in this case a time limit of say 2 months and petition along with a system to ensure that it is no an exploit could allow for a name change
i support the original proposal on the condition that rats in 0104 be much more profitable than rats in 0506
quoted for great justice
this it would attract some needed attention to low sec space
topic real life advertisingseveral mmorpgs have ingame advertising as a way to pay some of the bills on face value having a pizza hut ad on a medieval castle is silly and a determent to gameplay immersion however a few months ago i went back and tried out anarachy online to see how it was doing i played it at launch in 2001 before world events took me to the other side of the planet anyway they had real life advertisements and the ones they had scifi movie trendy sunglasses somehow fit in their edgy scifi world they also had ads for community sites something i hope incarna will have last year at least one ccp exec spoke about an additional purchasing model for dust 514 as a way to pay for the servers could incarna try to cash in on another kind of revenue stream to support the expansion some people consider such advertisement to be selling out questions how would you feel if incarna featured real life advertising as a way to support ccps hardware infrastructure is there any kind of realworld advertising you feel would be appropriateif you disagree with any kind of realworld advertisement would you support station advertisements for everated sites discuss
why would i want ads advertising gamerfuel when i know quafe is the only way to go
bring back quafe girl
its more of a question as to whether or not you could stomach it the ads not the quafe
i would liike to be able to advertise my corp i on instation billboards
1 tracking on rails is fine get to know your other weaponsystems and the ships they go on before changing that the only race with gunnery tracking or gunnery problems is caldire2  deimos and ferox to be fair i dont use ferox hardly at all but you cant give optimal incs on gallente ships that is a caldire bouns just like your never going to see a tracking inc on caldire ships i also dont play with ships smaller then bss much anymore this days ether 3 i know blasters need some love i do belive that 100 optimal inc is what they need at bs level 150 mite be right for curser level but i just dont use them that much to say myself thats were i would start with the twiking is inc the optimal between project and pulse keep the same tracking speed as projectils have basic ammo types that inc there tracking speeds though it would not brack my heart to get that inc and loss some tracking to fall some were between projectials and pulses
i do support the hybrid notion but i do not support blaster change blaster need more damage and tracking to reinstate gallente as the ultimate closerange killers making them something inbetween lasers and autocannons wount help the caseqft
look blasters should not have more range shtbust they dont need much more tracking what they need is more damage simpleblaster boats themselves need better speed not agility blaster boats should have the best straight line speed but fairly poor agility in other words gallente blaster ships will charge at their enemies get in range and unleash hell
the colors are sooo fail ccp needs to change this asap it takes all the fun out of scanning
change gfx options to high on the shader i think it is it all works then however yes better contrasting option would be much appreciated
same happens with high shaders

ive been soliciting feedback on the topic of corp role changes and with the next csm meetings issue deadline coming up its time to put this into an assembly hall post this is intended as a comprehensive look at the entire topic from top to bottom changing existing rolesccp has previously stated that theres a hard limit on the number of possible roles due to the backend design of the role system this is obviously not an ideal state of affairs but its a limit ill respect here thus my proposed changes are intended not to increase the number of total roles in game now on to the changes four roles can be removed with no major difficulties rent office can be folded into accountant contract manager into trader fitting manager into communications officer and station manager into config starbase equipment the last i may be wrong about i dont do 00 alliance work but it seems fairly safe this frees up four open slots for new additions  the industry roles are fundamentally broken and make security impossible take the three that currently exist and replace them with at minimum an install jobs role which only lets them canceldeliver their own jobs and a cancel jobs role which lets them work on anyones jobs you could also make viewing other peoples jobs impossible for the basic role and have a view all jobs role or you can split science and industry apart if you like though i dont really see a reason to do either  confignonstarbase equipment should only apply to unanchoring equipment not anchoring bubbles and cans should be freely anchorable  this is more ui than roles but auditors should be able to search the audit history by role and not just by member name  ie see all changes to config starbase equipment no matter which member it was to  ceos should be able to set default access rights for assorted pos structure types so that people dont have to whine for access every time a new lab goes online  the current baseheadquartersother split seems useless to me replace it with a system where each corp storage spaceposoffice can be put into abc and people can get separate access to a b and c this does remove base functionality so perhaps abbase works as a compromise but hqother is dumb and should be replaced also let the ceo pick which one poses fall into by defaultand maybe work in default access rights on pos structures while youre at it new roles the idea of a diplomat role has been proposed by ccp to allow nondirectors to set standings and i fully support it  corporations should have the option to switch from votelocking bposwhich is only really appropriate for things like ipos and very centralized corps to rolelocking them this change will require a blueprint manager role be added  im torn on this because it could make bumping too easy but a second corp trader role should be considered to allow you to modifycancel other peoples corp orders  this probably runs afoul of the role limits but use rights on office tabs could be interesting  dont allow them to take the stuff but allow them to use it for production jobswhich could only be delivered to the same hangar tab ofc this could allow jobs to be outsourced with fewer security concerns which should help newer players get into industry more easily other titles need to work properly especially as regards notifications a fuel techbyrole gets fuelmails while a fuel techbytitle does not grantable titles would be lovely as well but again this probably qualifies as 7 new roles  make it so that the ui doesnt make my eyes bleed yes itll use tables but they dont have to be horrible unintuitive poorlyexplained tables  allow corplevel api data to be split out by role not limited to directors only  eg let fuel techs see the starbasedetail xml this can be a ceo toggle or just an automatic system
separate access rights for individual poses at the moment i cant let people online more guns at our staging tower when under attack without giving them the right to unanchor all our mining poseshangar tabs in the sma with respective restricted accessalso slightly offtopic but personal hangars for each member in the cha let directors or a separate role set a quota for everyone or let directors access each members hangar to prevent someone from taking up all the cargo space
this would allow anyone that can control a pos to config outposts and offline tcus thus removing sovereignity from their alliance  i dont think this is a good ideathe rest is partly dangerous and mostly very useful supported although i dont like every aspect of it
excellent proposal
supported againthis has been brought up before it will be brought up againthis
an excellent suggestion fully supported might i also suggest adding make the entire roles interface much simpler and easier to use ive been playing for a couple of years and still cant always make it do what i want
once again supporting a classic hersch proposalunfortunately i seriously doubt theres a snowballs chance in hell ccp will even touch the damn thing for the next 18 months to 2 years in light of recent developments but one can hope
in order to eliminate hundreds of unecessary clicking i suggest that ccp implement a drag  drop feature on the containers in the overview plus the shift key feature to multiselect containers on the multiselect only containers whitin 2500m would be selected then you proceed to a drag and drop in your cargo and the content of the containers would be transfered to your cargo if the containers contains more than your cargo only some items would transfer
im having some trouble understanding your proposal so please bear with me herewhen i go salvaging and i open a new loot container i leftclick any item in that loot container hit controla to select all and then clickanddrag from the loot container to my cargohold thus i never have to drag each stack oneatatime does this address the problem youre trying to solvei would support some sort of functionality to autoloot all items from a container you try to open
i believe he means when in range of numerous containers you gain the ability to select all in range and take their loot with one action instead of opening each and then taking it all youd be able to shift select them from the overview which i gather ccp would say isnt possiblei would support the auto looting of containers you own but not for taking from other players containers
hi sir no thats how everyone proceed i guess using the crtla what i suggest is a simple drag and drop from the overview so no need to open each containers one by one also the multiselect would allow you to gather every containers in a blob do a shiftmultiselect then 1 drag and drop would empty all containers within range if you have enough cargo space much more efficient and way less clicking
im a programmer and its definitely possible also i agreee that this feature works only for your containers or your fleets
i support 110 i am tired of items disappearing and that way people can also track me borrowing from corp mate incase i forget to remind them i have it
im all for this ccp has to work this out this should of been in the game already

issue marauders are only susceptible to caldary ewar and not to any other races i dont see any reasons for only caldary to get the luxury of having boosted ewar against marauders everybody should be equal solution one remove the weaknesssolution two make them equally suceptable to everythingsolution three give every marauder a differnt weakness for example gallente will be vulnerable to minmatar but resilient to caldary and amarr caldary will be vulnerable to amarr amarr to caldaryetc or in any other combination

i for one am always down with braking new ground that is what ccp is doing here with mmo interfacing with a fps game i even like good fps games but i put down console game in my 20s just got a new alienware for fathers day and all i knew years ago after geting on my friends pc that i would never go back to console gameslong story short im happy for ccp and braking new ground its just that there is not much in it for me other the pi and station walking im not even doing pi so that leave station walking i know thats going to be cool for all of like 20 mins then i will probly get back in my ships and never get back out againi would be a 1000 times more happy if they were puting a pc version out with the console game

1 supposedly already fixed2 maybe change it to you get less payout based on how many ships you collect insurance on in a month or something ie the more you collect the less you get but any kill with concord involved should nullify the insurance contract3 no4 i think insuring items in a courier contract would be nice that way the issuer can insure the value of the cargo and might decrease the exploit concerns5 i like the idea might make people more willing to fly the nice ships if they can buy insurance from there alliance to supplement the eve insurancemongo

ok this is the wrong aspect to take on the csm issue we need an effectual csm process not only in terms of the csm election and vetting process but in how we approach current player concerns many players are very happy with the current state of the game stemming from the fact that they are limited in their scope of how they play they do one aspect and exclude most others to any depththis doesnt mean that some of the issues being whined about are without merit i believe that if there was an ingame interface that allowed for an easy evaluation of current balance issues as put forward from the player base where a player could not only agree disagree or abstain from adding their two pence to the convobut also puruse the topics at hand we would see more people taking notice of the csm process as of now with little transparency in the process as well as almost no concise gathering of the data on the issues the player base as a whole isnt going to have a lot of concern with the issuesrummaging through 100s of posts with flame wars and trolls mucking up the thread most people would rather simply work around balance issues or exploit them and get on with their game only a few people are actually going to take the time to look at deeper issuesthe reason i am so adamant about this particular aspect of the issue is that poor balance in the game results in less actual long term subscriptions to the game no one wants to play a game that has obvious issues limiting their scope of play if they are coming to the dark universe that is eve with its many hardships already extant why would they stay if mechanics issues make that existence in eve even harder
without so much as updating her blog that seems rather out of character to put it mildly
yes what you are asking is a free gift pirating is already easy and you ask to force prey to youyou are like a lazy lion asking to remove all the rivers with the exception of the one where you hunt so that every animal should got there to drink and you will get more and easier preywhat you are asking is not an opportunity to low sec you are asking a boost for a particular playstile and boosting pirating is exactly what low sec dont need los sec need boosting to the activities that can attract people to live there not an increase of passer by so that pirates have a easier time finding preyeven you admit what is your true intent and what will be the effectand that would boost low sec or it will only boost a single playstile

the csm has been doing this rfcs for years the players longer in featuressuggestions forumswe csm players can only give the best of exactly what we want as can be arranged from different people weighing in on an issue ultimately that decision on what and how to change x is up to someone or several people at ccp not any one player ccp doesnt allow the csm to speak to the people who get to decide if x is going to be changed they speak to the people who get told what to do but dont have the power to decide to do it i may be wrong perhaps they speak to people who could make that decision but havent for any number of reasons over the past couple of yearsi and any other player can write a detailed post or even have a one on one conversation with the programmersdeveloper who can make the changes i want but they are not going to listen to a single player on any issue nor are the players likely to 100 on every detail of a detailed proposal of how to change x

i actually quite like the learning skills but i dont know whyregardless they dont need to be in game and when a simple and effective solution like this one has been presented there is no reason they shouldnt be removedall i would say is that instead of giving players a 10000 skill training time increase ccp could use their new sp allocation method that they first showed off around 6 weeks ago due to the 20 hour server downtime but of course you didnt know about that like 3 months ago
if ccp wanted some kind authoritative definitive answer on this they could just run another election like they did with the csm and establish which items were the most populari suspect more than 12 of accounts would votestill props to trebor

u dont think that is the case how about instead of thinking from only the pirates myopic point of view actually put yourself in the bounty hunters shoes try italso bear in mind that one lossmail is a lot to lose to some ppl and thats why its the same hereat the same time though this isnt swg and what ppl can do under your system they can already do under the current one only theyre not constrained by not being able to shoot nonreds all ure offering is chump change as a reward to make ppl spend their subscription playing nice and of course since theres no guarantee of that reward because theres no way of telling who your target is and how he behaves why would anyone want to even try it and risk getting blobbed with nothing to show for it face it no ones gonna give up the fights they couldve gotten with criminal ganking when winnable low sec fights r already scarce enough as it is at least for nonblobs again instead of thinking of the pirate and only the pirate put yourself in the bounty hunters shoes for once

i suggest that ccp make a donation to the red cross for each plex lost in game due to change in game mechanicsreported by ccp zul devblogplex in my space its more likely than you thinkwhat i suggest is that cpp run a plex aid for haiti style donation may be ones a year or at end of each q with numbers on how many plexs have been destroyed to be reported by dr eyjog in his quarterly economic newsletteri fully support the change in game mechanics that removed the restriction on undocking from a station with a plex making them a destroyable itembut given the the number of 30 day pilots licenses that may be destroyed as a result of the new mechanics adding up to thousands of dollars i feel cpp should give a percentage of the profit in this case to a charity due the the fact it no longer has to honor 30 days of game time that was paid up front when the plex was purchased precedent for plex donation has been set by the plex aid for haiti regards anitta blake
good idea
hell why not maybe the red cross can fix the lag with the right funding
good or cancer research fear
brilliant ideait would also be some good pr with the mediaccp games donates another 5 thousand dollars to hundreds of needy kids who without the support of ccp games would surely diedoesnt that sound nice ccp
this would make me proud to play evesupported
really nice idea and no reason they shouldnt do it the plex have been paid for may as well put a portion of it to a good causeor maybe they could use the extra resources to hire and fund a crack lagfixing team
great idea
then why arent you supporting it
yea if you dont support it you will make babies throughout the world cry which might keep jita spamming down to an all time low
no no nolets just let ccp keep the money and have it disappear into thin airsupported

although its highly suspicious if ccp would ever even try to lean on to this id fully support op

this thread is a waste of time you cried ultra bitter tears when you heard ccp was using profit to make dust 514 and that did not stop them from doing itnow you want them to just give away money because you think they should not gonna happen

come to think of it that could be thousands of dollars in subscription money ccp doesnt have to honor anymore i didnt think of thatsupported
i would rather want to see ccp use that money on eve development i wouldnt mind seeing donation drives drom time to time where the players can voluntarily donate plexes to a charity but i dont really want to see them on a regular basis either
terribole idea use the money to fix lag not to give away money to the red cross who waste it away anyways
thisno amount of charity will suppress the glaring fact they wont polishtouch the damn game for 18 months to 2 yearssorry to say its very little incentive to support anything that a company would do to help others when it wont even help there own damn customers
how about stfu and dont undock with your plexs
screw charity it enslaves people and keeps those on their knees who youre trying to helpfix eve instead
yes lets give our unused computer gaming time to a money hungry  of a corporation with more dark secrets than lana torrins dirty panties  good idea 
thats essentially in my other proposal
god yes i want pizza pizza ads and movie previews on huge screens as i do the macarena
i demand flashing strobe light ads to induce seizures
i think the only way to go is to let eve players purchase the advertising space maybe with real money maybe with isk as an isk sink i dont wanna see iphones advertised in eve no way
i would be fine if ccp advertised as long and only as long as it stays off to the side as a kind of a subliminal message like the televisions at the gates the ad should look like it belongs and be available in the area that i am in or close or have a website also i do not want to wait for the ad to load or have a effect on my fps or memory more than the stations already do or have to watch one to get into incarna if i did i wouldnt ever use the feature
i could agree if the advertisers as a prerequisite adjust their ad to fit the immersion it might be interesting if realworld companies got creative and put their logo on futuristic products appropriate to the eve settingsome present ads might even already fit like the sony robot its just another drone right
i wouldnt notice because i would be in a spaceshipeve is an internet spaceship game you see
how about make ecm point based da very quick and light exampleship a has 15 sensor strengthship b can jam a total of 16 pointsship a becomes jammed aslong as ship b is jamming himecm racial jamming strength gets increased but with longer cycle time and cap usage range stays the samemultispec strength is reduced but a faster cycle time shorter range and increased cap usageeccm remains the sameidea being that an ecm ship can perma jam any unprepared ship eccm becomes a strong defenceas the ecm ship uses more jammers it runs out of cap quicker the pilot spends more time managing modules than praying for good lucklonger cycle times make it harder to cycle jam multiple ships aswell as capacitor pressurediscusstrollwhine
thats how it used to work in the past back then everyone fitted jammers in spare mid slots
thats why i suggested itnow if everyone fits ecm in the spare mids people will have to coordinate jamming just like the other party would have to coordinate projected eccmthe end of the day itll only affect small gangs and solo pvp anyway doesnt everyone hate the idea of winning or losing based on how lucky you get with ecmremove chance and make it more skill based just like the rest of the game except inventionor ill happily settle for a chance based sensor damp that has the chance to reduce target range and scan res by 100or a target painter that has the chance to increase sig radius of any ship to the size of a titanor a tracking disruptor that will possibly reduce tracking to 0i think thatll be fairinsert better skills give better chance whine here
if you were perma jammed in double eccmd bss 4 of you i want to see killmails to see exactly what situation you got into otherwise it didnt happenthere is absolutly nothing wrong with ecm or eccm at the minute what does suck is the pathetic bonus the other t2 ewar boats get primarily the sd and td bonuses they need to be buffedanyway like i said link the killmails or it didnt happen
fix please 
i propose that the money that is lost due to plexs being destroyed in a ship loss be used for map pack expansions for dust 514 when it comes outthese are exciting times for us eve players and this would enrich it further
how about they just fix eve and maintain it properly improving the miserable ui pos interface corpalliance interface useless ships etc and they can spend incinerated plex money on coke and hookers
eve is fine me along with countless others would like to see dust 514 come out with strong selection of maps and have continous free map pack updates
it is impossible to secure an industry corp correctlythe ability to invite new people and get them to work on locked blueprints is not functioning as they have the ability to shutdown the corpthe settings are hacks to make corp production work while not locking up individuals slotsits a dirty hack in the original code that needs to be replaced with a proper feature
i fully support corprelated issues are long overdue
i think its fair to say that not just roles need to be looked at  many things about corporations in eve need to be examined and revised cost and mechanics of wardecs poses etc however this is a succinct analysis of changes to the roles system and so i support this
i guess this will be a surprise for us in like 3 years rightright
so you are in this ship it could be heavy interdictor but doesnt have to be and you active the dimension anchor module it creates this bubble that makes all those within it unable to move in the updown axisdimension typically considered the z axistechnically speaking in the engine it should be easy checklimit to implementhow is it usefullets say i have my gang setup to engage about 30km40km optimal so i place them above or below the gate then with the dimension anchor bubble in place the gang cant mwd up or down to us to kill us for the moment giving us the advantage furthermore if they dont spawn on the proper 2d plane for the gate they also cant gun it back to the gategenerally speaking that boy on the gate will be a throw away ship they will certainly want him dead as fast as possible which any gang that jumps through ought to be able to do the job

go back to highsec and noob it up there because you obviously have no concept of what kind of trade and resource movement occurs just because you dont personally see it
what youre proposing is nonsense let me elaborate1 redistributing high end resources will encourage trade  false it will do the opposite if i have a monopoly on resource x im not going to trade with my neighbour im going to stockpile it and watch the price rise sky high then im gonna go to jita and make a killing every other person such as myself will do the same thing so basically everything ends up in jita at astronomical prices distributing things more evenly is what encourages more local trade because the profit difference between jita  local price is smaller encouraging more local selling due to costsrisks of hauling to jita2 redistribution will encourage more combatexpansion  false as has been mentioned there are already enough reasons to invade other peoples space more importantly no good alliance will go out and start taking tons of space just to gobble up these resources that would be stupid because you wont be able to defend all your holdings appropriately likewise no smallnew alliance is going to suddenly come up with a huge supercap fleet and go out and take high end stuff away from established alliancesso basically if the changes you propose were made the status quo in 00 would be relatively maintained and everyone would just pay higher prices for certain things
ed post is ed as forin other words what you imply is that every other person in eve thinks exactly like you and will rather sit on their hands watching their neighbour harvest pretty ressource x aslong as they want just so they can buy it in jita well i highly doubt thatif its distributed evenly who needs trade you dont have to talk to your neighbour about sht because he can harvest the same stuff and wont ever look at you he will even have far more possibilitys to get it cheaper on the market and dont care at all about what you think or do local selling will always be the same and in more cases be done by people that fear risk of transport in 00 and guess what exactly more people fear risk as more pricey a product a isthan why do we see so few campaigns see it as it is with the new sovereign mechanics it doesnt really matter which kind of claimable 00 space you hold right now space has more show off and sentimental as insmother to ra value rathe than making any difference between spaceholderyou mean like ra did with pure blind some time ago stil being based in insmother or atlas going to geminate to take the technethium moons yeah sure your right please move alongwith the new timer system where you are encouraged to show up only once in 4 cycles a dedicated defender could indeed defend that in my oppinion its rather the leaking motivation of people to leave their home to go x jumps away which makes such things seem impossibleand that is the mainproblem in eve new alliances that acctualy have some issues with refunding a capital fleet on a daily basis get their capital ship blasted with the single click of a button in mass sure a cap fleet battle of 50 vs 100 dreads wouldnt be much different but the chances to take something down with you are given unlike now its just not worth to try if you cant even cripple your enemy a bit even when you try and loose a lotin empire maybe in 00 it could acctualy make things move if you see that a few systems in the neighbouring region that are quiet close to you would have a certain ressource that has high value right now we have too much equality may it be minerals being the same everywhere or a high amount of any moon mineral  alchemy
i can understand what the op is saying but i think it would be a nightmare for the impact of alliance control and dominance in the regions however i think this concept could be applied to highsec regionswhy the gallente offer blueprints for amarr towers ill never know this should be fixed but this is a small fraction of what is overall a bad proposalnot supported
i think dessies are supposed to be used as alpha machines used in wolfpacksin that role thrashers are clearly the omgwtfpwnmobiles of destroyersthey have massive alpha due to artillery boost and their scan resolution is superior to any other destroyer note that you can get nearly as good alpha out of an artillery catalyst god forbid and an artillery coercer but the thrasher will always get the first shot and it can fit a point tooedit near maximum alpha schedule for 280mm howitzer artillery iifit destroyers cormorant 1291catalyst 1695coercer 1743thrasher 1854
yeah its kind of silly to boost them more when thrashers already excel too much in their frig killing role and in large groups are such highpowered cheap alpha that they already win the isk war versus almost any target even if destroyed
well what about all others
errrhave you seen what neutralizers can do to a gallente or amarr battleship or any other cap intensive ship for that matter tracking disruptors are also pretty bad for turret ships of all types as well moreover target painters are good for what they do making ships bigger and webs work on almost any ship frigates especiallynot supported
first off c a l d a r ilearn to spell before you insult the caldari pilots and there shiny ravens winknudge nudgesecondly  dont drink and postbecause its quite painfully obvious you dont know what your talking aboutevery single ship in this game has the same possibilities of getting ewared as anyone else except those that have immunity and even then that depends on your definition of ewarand that has its own slew of skills to change the game overalland naturally each race has a weakness that can be preyed uponyou obviously do not know them or your just rage posting over a falcon
how is that relevant to my proposalobviously you can neut or sensor damp a marauder but i am talking about its exceptional vulnerability to jamming compared to other ships of the same class i will explain again marauders have lowered sensor strength compared to other battleships that makes them more vulnerable to caldary ewar then normal battleships why do only caldari get the privilege of being exceptionally effective against them why are marauders only made vulnerable to caldary what is this some sort of racism falcon can reach jamming strength of 15 so it permajamms kronos with a single  jammercan a curse permanently cap out kronos with a single neut to the point where it cannot shoot i dont think so neuts do work against marauders but only to the same extend that they work against all battlships caldary for soem reason get the luxury of decreased sensor strengthi am not talking about any race i am talking about a class of ships maraders all of them again how is that relevant to my post
im fairly sure the reason why marauders get very low sensor strength is that the ss is tied to probing mechanics giving them a low strength means that they are easily probable and very hard to make unprobable with eccm boosting methodsthe caldari ew is just a side effect
i was attempting to make a semihumorous jab about how neutralizers seem to be unfair or as you put it racist against cap intensive ships ie amarr and gallente actually yes it canffs caldari every time you put a y at the end my eyes blear up and my inner spelling  screams at 130 decibelsbut back on topic i believe that it has something to do with the fact that ecm is the only form of ewar that is chance based that and marauders are awesome ships and need some sort of drawback to not be too awesome
marauders have low sensor strength to keep them from being used in pvp unless you sacrifice a slot for eccm
well why is it that only the caldary can make use of this drawback why not make them weak to sensor dampeners caldary ecm is already good not like it needs more buffing by giving ships low sensor strength

read a few of these posts and some of the ideas are good others not so forcing people through lowsec would more than likely make people quit lol reading these got me into thinking what if the security status of a system could be changed through player interaction the highest you could bring a low sec system to would be a 05 and in doing so maybe bring in a small amount of navy support for the faction in control i guess it would be similar to the way they have the fw thing setup but some how working in a way to allow the systems security to change depending on players actions within the system also making a few pirate type missions available in the system to allow the sec status to be dropped piratesplayers taking out the npc security would drop the security status while mission runners doing mission would increase the security status of a systemthese are just a few things that popped into my head while reading these posts maybe these could help spark more ideas

tamber told me to do it
this day in eve most people dont use active personal repairers because the cap usage is just too high because everyone and their dog uses at least one neut now active tanks even support ones for example one armor repairer on a buffer tanked ship dont work at allplease consider reducing the capacitor usage of personal repair systemsto balance things out with the whole missions would be too easy deal a few choices would be to increase the capacitor usage of repair systems in deadspace or to simply make the mission npcs hit harderanother idea would be to double their duration but double the amount they repair to reduce the amount of time you need to be feeding the module capanother idea would be to increase the base capacitor recharge of ships this would be more of a neut gimp howeverthis includes both armor and shieldsim trying to make it clear that remote repairshield transfer systems are not part of my topicedit since the trolls have left 4chan let me make it clear that i am not trying to gimp neuts mainly because i fly the curse most of the time what i am saying is that its way too easy to keep someone below the amount needed to make one rep cycle
tldrdouble duration double repair amount of armor repairshield boost systemsorhalf capacitor consumption of repair systems increase mission damage outputsupporting my own thread
ah another teary neut victimso instead of a stealth neut gimp while breaking pve in the process why dont you just suggest an outright neut gimp
so kinda like this
active tanking is pretty much obsolete in pvp and this could be one possible measure to help remedy that as you said though it would have knockon effects on missioning and im not sure either of your proposed fixes would work

every time you post a new thread i think this has to be it the bottom of the barrel nothing could be worse than thisand then you post a new thread and prove me wrongthank you for continuing to provide me with both lulz and an ever deepening understanding of just how stupid one human being can be

good idea
there is something really annoying in jukeboxeve should save jukebox status for each client separatelylets say you have 2 accountsthe first one should play eve music the second should notif you log in and log out of the first account it doesnt matter what was the config for the second account when you log in to the second account music will be played because the last active account was playing music thats a kind of bug or lack of feature
thumbs down use the money to fix the game oh wait that would require competence might as well just spend it on making fanfests better or whatever instead then use it to improve some aspect of eve not anywhere else or i guess just spend it all on icelandic liquor and wake up a week later to find out that capitals were accidentally allowed in highsec and concord went on strike or something that would be awesome too
not supported because its stupidalso i want to point out that if this does happen youre all going to  and moan about which charity it is
no ccp keep the money fix the damn lag with it and the bugsbe a great motto everytime you pop a plex we kill a bug
oh hahahahahaha you guys you think ccp is going to donate the tens of thousands of dollars they are making of plexs that will be killed this year aloneyou are out of your mind
yes pleasethat would remove all ethical implications of ccp profiteering and benefit society
supported
every time any in game isk is destroyed ccp should  no must  donate to some charity obviously every isk sink benefits ccp by removing value that we have worked hard for or bought via gtc from the gameits only right and the charities deserve it for those who say no  you would deny money to hungry children shame on you
yes please
i give support to this
i fully support this since i find it logical each time a plex card is destroyed in the game ccp automatically wins 1750 while i do not say ccp must donate the whole amount i say a part of it should be donated to different charitiesand as proof
how is ccp profiteering people are simply being morons there is nothing unethical about giving people the opportunity to undock with plex they arent making you undock with 74 plex they arent making pirates shoot them and plex have the same drop rate as every other item in eve nothing to see here move alongyes i would because i am a cold hearted bastard and support ccp in its moron profiteering ok so maybe i am a cold hearted bastard but thats beside the pointi think that every time a titan is destroyed ccp should give 3500 to a charity wait what that doesnt make sense and neither does giving money to charity when a plex dieshtfupage 3 snipe
i give full support to this idea just tonight i was made aware of some poor soul who lost 74 plex cards destroyed thats 100000 us ccp pockets for nothing this isnt to say that ccp is ebil theyre not profiteering but since that is pure profit it would be nice to see a  go to a world relief agency only for ones destroyed though as ones not still have their value in game timegreat idea by the op
ccp i wholeheartedly support this idea and would even like to recommend as suggested via an earlier voice chat with an alliancemate childs play as the most apropos charity to donate tosigned blogged tweeted
why support stupidity are you all that dumb that you cant make a jitaalt and redeem the plexs on that alt and sell them then transfer the isk to your maini mean reallywhat possible reason could you have to transport plexs plexs are roughly 300 315million some willing to pay 330mill so its not like youre buying low selling hightreat plexs like a titan you dont build a titan to sellyou build it for yourself or for the corpin closing dont be stupid

not supportedare you ppl daftccp has a set goal of money theyre trying to make they do not exist to fund charitiesthey are a for profit businessyou want to waste your own money on these scams ie charities then feel free to donate directly to them dont raise my monthly subscription fee so you can feel better about your pathetic wasted lives
oh my god a for profit corporation profiteering damn what will they think of next ccps change to the plex system like most good changes forces absolutely no change whatsoever if people wanted to they could treat the new one exactly like the old one and never move plex and thus none would ever be destroyed just like before if pilots choose to be stupid with them well thats their call same as if they are stupid with an expensive ship or deadspaceofficer mod or whatever there is zero difference thats the entire point of the change after all to make them items just like everything elsethis is a stupid thread there are tiny amounts of money involved and ccp should focus first and foremost on us the customers paying for eve if at some point in the far future ccp has actually fixed most of the vast number of glaring problems in this game then sure with the huge excess might make sense to offer a few targeted charity programs maybe as part of competitions with the winners able to decide which charitys get the donations as some basic policy thing though dumb particularly since we cant agree on which charities to go for anyway i think the eff would be a much better cause for example and would have more of a direct benefit to the game and all of us personallythere are no ethical implications here at all ccps benefit to society is already clear they make eve employ lots of people etc thats capitalism at its best they dont generate tons of externalities like some other industries an mmog provider is about as clean as it getsunlimited thumbs down works
yes
destroyed plexes for the red crossi like it
as much as i think this is a good idea i cant support itplain and simple there are alternative ways to afford plex aka isk i sit in a system and rat for countless hours and buy plex from the isk i make no realworld transaction done on my part the person who originally bought the plex has already been paid in full for it through ingame exchange any loss of the plex after that point is due to the purchasers own stupidity and does not necessitate an actual realworld monentary lossi do like the idea of a constantlyrunning plex for haiti like system but otherwise its just darwins law being played out with internet pixels
not a fan of the red cross but i like the idea maybe give charity to an organization without such a tainted record
signed
i approve of this idea
not sure if its very practical but hey ill support anything that encourages spreading the love
as nice as gratuitous acts of altruism are ccp need these funds to hire staff improve the game and continue to provide the great service they always have i for one feel that ccp should maintain the right to contribute to charities as they see fit rather than have it imposed on them by a vocal minority of the player base who could do more themselves rather than force proxy charity in my humble opiniontldrfix lag plz
i endorse this here idea

i support this ideamy corp might be jerks ingame but the reallife always needs more charity
look at all these bleeding hearts as with most liberalprogressive ideas its ing terribleif you want to donate to charity or write a check to the government around tax time go ahead no ones stopping you but dont try and tell a company what they should do with their money
actually the only people i feel sorry for are the two pilots who got totally screwed by a terrible drop
excellent idea in mulling around the implications of plex destruction i really only see one big problem with it in the past every 15 plex eventually at least potentially gets redeemed into 30 days of game time it may trade hands for lots of isk but sooner or later someone uses it for game time ccp sells 30 days of access for a certain amount of cash how that 30 days moves around the community is not there concern of course someone might sit on that plex or even forget they have it but it is always there it is always a 30 day access potentialnow we have the case of plex being destroyed not a big deal from a game play perspective but from an outside observer the 15 can be pocketed by ccp but now they never have to provide the service the 30 days that it represented no just sitting there and wondering if they will ever use it it is now gone and can be closed out in accounting terms i know that some retailers have run foul of state laws regarding gift cards that never get redeemed i worked for a retailer in it during the time that they implemented gift cards and they originally wanted the cards to expire after a year it bugs accountant to leave liabilities like this just hanging around that idea got squashed by some of the states that the retailer did business in i dont know what the current rules and laws are this was over a decade ago but i can imagine that this will represent a breach of contract somewhere even if it all turns out to be legal everywhere which seems unlikely at the very least it has the potential to be less than popular from a pr perspective and if ever you have a ccp employee simply playing the game on a regular alt even during there own freetime and they make a kill that ends with destroyed plex you could have a very very messy legal or accounting audit for they potential conflict of interest that it represents however taking the cash value of these plexs and donating it to an international and well respected charity like red cross could first probably be more easily worked into the eula second it removes the conflict of interest as ccp never gets the cash for a service not rendered and third it would create very positive publicity and it should really be the full price of the plex ccp still gets a little cash from the gtcplex transaction fee so they are not out the cost of handling the transactionsbesides how cool would it be to descend on some  with bloodthirsty fury and have it result in cash being sent to save peoples liveswhy why you why it was for the childwen bwahahahahaoh the delicious ironyso thumbs up for this one stellar idea pun fully intended
i support this but really the only change they need to make is make a plex indestructiblethe guy above me i totally agree with the fact that a ccp employee could willfully go in game declare war on people who are to knowing transport plexes information which they can obtain and kill every single one of them within real game mechanics with no god mode or anything they just know is one legal nightmare i would have though ccp would want to avoidsimply making plexes not be able to be destroyed is the solution allow people to transport them sure if someone kills the ship and it drops an indestructible can with plexes in it then thats the transports loss still unless he has a buddy right there it still adds in the joy of killing or even suicide ganking someone for the sweet juicy plex reward the only difference is that game time can still be honoredive heard lots of people talk about and try to justify what it means when a plex is destroyed to me its a quick buck ccp has made at mechanics they implemented it just seems shady to meif they dont want to give money as a donation which they should get tax breaks for so its not all loss to ccp then make the plex unable to be destroyed anywhere for any reason in a ship it drops a can separate from the wreck one that cant be targeted or one that has like 1 million hp or something its as simple as that
lets not do thatbut lets do what topic sez
fantastic idea but i think ccp already use that 1300 why give to charity that money when they can use to buy 1300 beer  1 beer  090  in spain100 sure
oh my i just realized what the real problem is with this what ccp really will be accused of not that it has any basis in fact but that wont matter to a taxing authority or a small army of blood thirsty class action lawyers the problem is not with the possibility of a ccp employee flying around and ganking plex haulers i was asking myself as many others have who could possibly be stupid enough to buy that much plex actually have that much isk and be stupid enough to haul it this person was ganked in jita they didnt even get out of the system that they likely bought it all in before they got scanned down and d why would anyone do thatthat is really the question that is going to plague ccp why indeed will ask the lawyer who would have the most interest and motivation to fill a transport with that much game time that could be destroyed there isnt a pirate out there that wouldnt suicide gank his own grandmother for the chance at 1 plex let alone 74 but who would take the chance at putting them in space in the first place the problem here for ccp is not if they did such a thing i dont think they would too stupid but the problem is that that fact will not stop the lawyers from filing suit every time a plex goes up in flames this is the real reason that ccp has to remove their own conflict of interest from the destruction of plex either it is made nontransportable again indestructible or the value of the destroyed plex gets gets donated so it never sees their bottom line
meh why not
you do realise that this would not hirt macroes in the slightest as adding launch dronesminemineminemine zzzzzmine some morerecall dornes warpis not very difficult what they are gonna do is cause trouble for t1 mining barges so make them weak you would have to tank a t1 mining barge but would not have tot tank a hulk to kill themthey should be somehting like battleships in lowsec not very common but they happenonly the weakest crusiers please

my idea is basically allowing a person to use a plex as payment to transfer a character should that need ever arise supporting my own idea
supported also for character portrait transfers
simple makes sence
i agree
i was on the point of posting a similar proposal makes a lot of sense to use plex as a standard admin token for character transfer or a new portrait
should also make extra money to ccp a plex is 30 char transfer is 20 but i am sure there are people who would for various reasons rather give 300misk for the transfer this would also leave the option of paying for the transfer by the buyer

i would love to see any advertising related to eve like quafe etc even eon and eve shop and advertisement for corps like apply now cause were so awesome or buy cheap bpcs right around the corner in our bpc shop but hell no i never ever want to see stuff not related to ccp advertised in eve other ccp games would be ok with me but not moreeve has around 300k subscribers at least thats the number i have in my head im sorry if im wrong and each of them pays around 15 a month that sums up to 4500000 if thats not enough to pay everything
lol you realise that the only ship with bigger cap issues then the rokh is your laserboat without the cap usage bonus hybrids have fairly sizable cap issues worse then the apoc easy and competing with the baddon though not surpassing it megathrons a favorite of pilots that have trained gallente and want in a fleet nothing more if you compare kill mails in fleet combat from a year or two ago you can see the massive shift towards the apoc please try and fly some of the hybrid ships out there before telling us theres no cap issues with it
i amy flying a rokh and i confirm that its cap suckson a more serious note you are right and blasters do need more damge and tracking so they can apply that damage
in an effort to diversify the racial supercarriers from each other what if their remote ecm burst was split into different ewar types for each supercarrierwyvern  remote ecm burst as currentlyaeon  remote energy neutralisation burstnyx  remote warp scrambling burstthis would be an aoe warp scrambler with a persistent effect similar to a distor bubble but unlike a warp disrupt probe or heavy dictor bubble it would not tackle supercaps since that would make the nyx massively powerful against such targetshel  tbcthe obvious suggestion would be a remote target painting burst or aoe webifier but neither of those seem quite as powerful as the other options so open to further suggestionsstrengths burst radii ranges and durations could all vary between the ships for balance purposes if required
there is no doubt that the ecm burst must be changed i think just changing it from a burst to an actual ecm jam that is based on the racials ie gravimetric ladar radar etc would fix it
i think remote ecm burst is mostly used to gtfo in your mothership so basically you nerf all other 3 motherships
this would make scanning a much better experience 100 supported

why have a map pack when dust players should be fighting on player created pi installationsreading in to this fact one would have to assume that the maps would be generated based on the items in a pi complex the planet type and possibly a randomly generated terrain landscapeideally if pi is developed properly then hopefully it will be the eve players actually designing the maps through more interactive pi setups and layouts
i dont have any active tcus to mess with this but according to evelopedia tcus are already handled under config starbase equipment and station manager roles only apply to actual outposts if youre already trusting someone with the ability to take away sov or rip down your towers then trusting them to set docking fees and reinforce timers seems minimal confirming that if this ever happens it will be a surprise
proposing a system where players can help noobs for a bonus training timeisketc take a char from an account less than a few month old to tag along in missions with rewards shared or roamingcamp and included in killmails for a small sp training time bonus or other appropriate reward a penalty for noob kill only while in highsec or rookie ship elsewhere may also help it would help grow eve subscription base a lot a few months later when accounts bonus period ran out and everyone became decidedly less friendly the exnoob would have invested too much in the mmorpg to cancel on a whim they would also have enough sp to stay in the player corp that invited them in initially for the incentive community also keeps them from leavingit would benefit everyone noobs get helped and initiated into part of corpsactive community those who help get an incentive pirates get real carebears to gank as opposed to rookie ship kills stumping out seedlings before they grew
people would just use it to cut the training time on their salvaging alts rather than helping genuine newbies
propose a complete system so that we cann see all the pros and cons of it while i agree that alot of eves game mecanic is counterintuitive and tutorials while they did get beter are still lacking joining a good corp ususally colves those problems i dont quite see what exactly you are proposing
what about a stasis webifier
no offense but this is just stupid
to allow us to change the our buyout price after we have created a contractespecially after people have bid on it that is all

would you mind to elaborate for me in how far it would change anything regarding the control of a region you stil use the same ships to shoot the same installations to hold space and have the same timer to overcome to take systemcontrolmaybe i am not imaginative enough to follow your thoughts but if you mean that conflict would be iminent than its a damn good addition to 00as for highsec yes i think highsec needs an overhaul to in the industrial factor but seeding certain tradegoods for special purposes should be limited to 00 because else the inflation will be far too high on such goods and most people like plamya would simply sit back and do nothing while waiting for things to reach a more or less reasonable price once transported to jita
thats so true stuff is always sold  bough from jita that sucks hard in this gamewhy do the taxes do not increase depending on the station usage or maybe some stations could lower or rise their taxes depending on the stuff being sold this would create more trade hubs around
this13 of t2 ship cost in eve is not far off if you make it so that a certain group is swimming in so much isk that its impossible to take territory from them the game will get more stagnant what youre suggesting is already in eve and the results can be seen change is needed but in the opposite direction your suggestion will just make things more stagnant not supported
not this because you fail to realise that inthebutt was taking it as acctualy ore as we have which is not the case also note that it was described as very region based so aslong as you spread enough minerals arround and among the reasons supply will also be held low but not make it unreasonable to ever create or total abandon slow inflation which will be needed to bring the price downas formaybe it is maybe it is not but you also have to note that a lot of the oldest player are in such major alliances which have large funds and continuesly also buy t2 bpo with them decreasing the price further sure it dont reaches the output of invention but that 90 of the tech moons are to be held by 1 group is also the players fault even through ccp with their moon update wellit was never suggested to have it as huge isk surge but rather a reason for people to acctualy compete over ressources but not over a single one but rather certain kinds of ressources that are distributed through alliance territorys and also require more politics which can be quiet frustrating in everegarding the ifstagnant part isnt anything that could make the large blocks compete even over single systems worth the implementation right now everyone just sits there not doing anything because the sovereign mechanics favor the defender but what if the attacker would be fine with just a few systems and not a complete steamrollthe attacker could inititate some kind of a blitzkrieg to snatch a system as fast as possible trying to rule as much chances as possible for the defender out which might escalate into a greater war just because this single system might spawn the rare ressource x in a monthly interval to be harvestedyou clearly didnt read the op at all there is not a single ressource in eve that is specialy based on a region even ratsofficers and their loot spawn in several regions under the same flag if your point is moon minerals your also mistaken as there is a rather large number spread about several regions aswell as alchemy sure you can come again with your 90 argument but that has nothing to do with gamedesign but rather with successful alliance forming by playersplease elaborate opposite direction as in making stufff even more common common enough that people never need to move out of empire because all the stuff you can get in 00 is allready obtainable in every conquerable region apart from the regionbased factionloot so please tellmaybe super capitalsyou can buy titans and motherships in the marketforum they are quiet common now and also not limited to 00 anymore i really dont see your point
in the main system on the test server simply create a wormhole maybe several and make it stay there forever so there is no mess with finding them and no need for devs to find them and waste their time like this
at the moment it takes too many clicks to get to the right item in the contracts menu proposal when you right click on a dramiel or any other faction item there should be the option show contracts
ccp could you please look at the option of changing the way pos offensivedefensive modules are controlledchange it from the current system to something more like a ship when taking control of the guns your ships own weapons disappearas now but you are able to lock multiple targets and and direct fire at different ship much like you can in a ship a scenario would be when the ships you are firing on suddenly receive lots of remote reps you could simply select another target stop your gun firing and then open fire on the new target due to the very slow lock time it makes it difficult to attack ships at the best of time let alone when they have lots of triage carriers in support or potentially reduce lock time on manned modules any views opinions fellow pos gunners

something has changed its now whoever does the most damage not whoever lays the final blow this was changed because ninjas were using highvolley ships to vulture killmails
look closely at their stats while marauders have a slightly longer targeting range over their t1 variations they also have slightly less scan resolution and the 40 dampening effect that a basic t1 sensor dampener can bring to either range or resolution is nothing to sniff atin a way marauders are already weak against sensor damps
ccp dont publish any details and never mention this again or we will go to court evaevaffffffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuunot saying that is what happened but something like it is highly probable imagine yourself in her situation you technicaly breached the nda and you get canned but no further legal action is taken against you wether it was a serious breach or just a minor one i would prolly not mention it ever again and just go on with my life and not take the risk i angered the companyany other course of action would be plain stupid i would say as you have nothing to win and can only lose
that is a really big rubber duckie
possible but by the same token if she wasnt nailed dead to rights we most likely would have seen some sort of argumentretractionstatement a google search for eva jobse has several hits to stories about an alleged nda breach and any employer she might have will probably google her if its in the tech field if she couldve gotten a retractionfollowup exonerating her id wager shed have done it
my guess is anybody would do that hence she prolly couldnt get that
eve truly is the game that took griefing to a whole new level
too bad you did the math wrong in that suggestion this would be much more suitableincrease the base attributes by 12 and increase the lowest number of attributes you can assign in a remap from 5 to 17 this will more or less compensate for the lack of the 10 boost provided by the learning skillend resultminmaxed char without implants 2721 2250sph compared to 275209 2277sphminmaxed char with 5 implants 3226 2700sph compared to 33264 2770sphin other words we are talking about a max sp reduction of 613k spyear for a 5 implant char and 236k spyear for no implants another thing to consider is that before the neural remaps the highest speed you could reach in game was 2739sph
hmm i think you may be right its been a while since ive had to compute training speeds for the evie tool i wrote a few years backif someone can confirm mashies numbers ill amend the proposal and is there a way to get closer to the current numbers im a bit of a sp and dont want to gyp my 5 implant empire logistics alt
ok i just redid the the math slightly to make it even less of a sp drop compared to current levelsincrease the base attributes by 12 so the lowest value in a remap is 17keep the 15 distributable points but change the max assignable from 15 to 16 5 clone with maxmin attributes base distribute imps total12 16 5 3312 9 5 2612 5 5 2212 5 5 2212 5 5 22new max speed 33262  2760 sphold max speed 332642  2772 spheffective change 043 or 105120 spyear  empty clone with maxmin attributes base distribute imps total12 16 0 2812 9 0 2112 5 0 1712 5 0 1712 5 0 17new max speed 28212  2310 sphold max speed 2752092  2277 spheffective change 14 or 289080 spyearnow before everyone is going omg we lose speed with these attributes in 5 clones you have to remember that it is still 192720 spyear faster than was possible before the neural remapping was introduced

just bumping to ask you really dont want to share that listit seems strange that there are hard facts about the success of the csm and it is not made public despite people asking for it every now and then
they are basically making  up they are getting all kinds of free perks and special privilages being in the csm so the will dance their whole term not really producing anything its politics this csm has accomplished nothing just like the one before it and the one before it so on and so on you get the idea
thats an index page  it doesnt need to be updated because it changes automatically as issues get recategorizedi actually did a pass at updating the issues in process list before i started the crowdsourced prioritization last week and theres a few more items that need updating that i will try and get to later this week
if this is an accurate up to date list then it conflicts with dierdra vaals statement that 18 or 33 proposals raised by csm 12 were completed by the end of csm 3 i had noticed that in previous csms issuesproposals rarely had their own wiki pages is this part of the issue
anyone else notice that ever since the csm have been weighing in to ccp on what should be what that the game has been slowing going to the dumps its like the more they get involved with thing the worse the outcome they were heavily involved with dominion and look how great that worked outcsm on behalf of the eve community please stop meddling with our game you are there to only make sure there is no more t20 incidents not give us more broken sov mechanics and double click pi crap
i dont think you get the csm
i can understand this if you dont follow what is going on with the csm through ignorance or misinformation and for your sake ill believe the latter let me therefore enlighten you about what the csm does and has done for the gamethe reason the game has slowed down to a crawl can be viewed in the most recent csmccp meeting minutes ccp has stated beyond the shadow of a doubt that while they may pay some marginal attention to eve they are instead focusing on dust and incarna until those are launched their backlog is huge even when i was in csm 2 and there is a lot on their plateswe are not there to ensure another t2o doesnt happen as we have no control or administration of ccp t2o caused the ia internal affairs department to come into being and theyre the ones that kicked larkonis trassler out immediately and may have had something to do with ankhesentapemkah as well we dont know due to lack of informationsov mechanics and pi are great examples of what seems to be ccps trend since after apocrypha  great ideas with horrible implementation i helped write a good bit for dominion but im not sure how much of my document was written and i can tell you that a lot of stuff was left out completely
youve been using tq to play starcraft havent you just admit it
correlation does not imply causation post hoc and hoc are fallacies not winning trains of thought
how about you just fix the lag instead of posting on the forums all day
yall capsuleers poastin in a troll thread
the csm is simultaneously being completely ignored by the devs and helping them to ruin evethis stuff is confusing
heywhat if winning the alliance tournament could win major alliances a special npc interaction storyline related evolution choices that could shape a little the eve universesay an alliance is big enough it could be eligible if it won the tournament to help out some npc faction achieve some incredibily exciting and highly risk and remunerative operation similar to the ones happening between npc factionsdunno sounds fun and interactiver
rp alliances generally would be the only people to really care about a prize of this nature and those alliances are yet to win any tournamentthe point of the tournament prizes is to entice major alliances to take part imagine pandemic legion winning and being rewarded with some stupid roleplayer crap instead of just getting the valuable items that were up for grabs this year would they and the other major competitors even bother coming back or spending countless hours working on setups next year
thumbs upcurrent poses are old and ugly and old and uglymake them less buggy better looking and add more usefulness to a high sec pos pi bonuses perhaps ooooooh now theres an idea

eve needs fixingwithout eve they could not work on the other projects we are funding them with our subs

here is hoping someone at ccp with the power to refocus their priorties reads and understands this post
in my 24 years of experience in software development i have noticed a few things1 it is much easier to write new code than to fix old code if one can find a software developer that can work with existing code grab that sucker and hold on to them they are a rare find i usually see this as a good programmer that is flexible and without an ego which is indeed a rare find2 it has been shown that it may take from 410 times the resources to fix an issue after it has been released than if it were caught in the design phase thus it is not cost effective from a management standpoint to fix things but to just introduce new features perhaps ccp is getting to a level of corporate mentality and maturity where the bottom line is much more important than customer satisfaction or even the product they produce itself which eventually happens to the best of them i guess3 many software developers who have made a name for themselves do not want to fix code all they want to do is make new systems and move on thus to keep some developers around some companies must always have new projects else these sacred cows will leave to work somewhere else i guess this is just the creative nature of these developers and why some believe that software development is an art not a science fixing coding and design issues just is not fun and may eventually show that some of these developers are not wearing any clothoes4 a company like ccp is made up of specialists many of those positions are based on new development so what happens to these people when one goes back to fix problems lay them off until they are needed again to let someone go and rehire someone else is to not only lose expertise but also to require a retraining period for the new person which may take a very long time something management does not want to hear5 everything is not always what it seems appearances are much more important than reality and management has a great way of pretending that all is fine in many ways they have no choice especially if the horses are already out of the barn and running everywhere6 i try to remember it is not what people do that really matters as much as to why they do it it would appear that ccp management has decided on new features over fixing and finishing old ones because it is to their benefit to do so at least in their eyes and in the short term walking in stations and dust 514 will bring two new types of customers into eve thus translating into  fixing old issues for customers has never generated new revenue so ccp management is obviously looking to expand its revenue rather than make old customers happy so what if half of the old customer base leaves the new customer base will make up for it mangament problem solved that is why most companies will treat their new customers much better than their old ones it is all about new business old business is like well oldi think ccp is doing what is best for itself and it is up to us to either follow along like sheep or find something else i believe ccp has done a great job overall in producing eve online however it is not always the 90 that works that is most visible but the 10 that does not in this case that 10 is a deal breaker for most of us making the game unplayable for some of usi have little hope that ccp will change its development approach it is just not to its benefit to do so at this time until the bottomline starts to fail will ccp change anything with walking in stations and dust 515 coming out i do not see that happening soon i also expect the csm to be disbanded as a failed experiment soon as it did not support the objectives of ccp oh well perhaps all this too shall pass we will see
one thing that really bothered me was when ccp said that it was making the csm a stakeholder in the company looks confused i have played eve online for over two years now when the hell i have not been a stakeholder in eve online i guess i have just gotten to an age where my time is worth more than money not only have i invested money but i have also invested a lot of my personal time here in eo i can imagine how some that have invested their time from the eo beta and release must feel if eve online goes away all that personal time will be gone there will be nothing left so believe me ccp i am a stakeholder in eve online and what happens here has a direct effect on me personallynow i am also a realist and understand that eo will eventually go away however by the very nature of the game design eo is a long term project type of endeavor so do not tell me that i am not a stakeholder here that is not something that ccp can bestow on anyone it is what we as playerinvestors determine ccp by rights may own eo and all aspects of it but we as players morally own it too if ccp management does not understand that well perhaps the end of eo has started to happenperhaps what we as players are saying here is that we wish to have a sense of justice and do not want to feel that our concerns and loyalities are being taken for granted i just hope that ccp management is better at fixing customer relations than they are at fixing eo

damn i missed this for some reason 
oh based on a player suggestion i updated the page so it has a list of the raw unfiltered results 1 was as you might expect commit to excellence
scan move extractors set routes click reset extractors be done with itideally each simple route would take all the extractors capacity to the single target storage so i dont have to set the extraction amount remember that number then independently set the routing amount but one step at a time 
batch jobs  badotherwise i have to support this i currently manage 18 planets hoping to make it a full 25 within the next couple of weeks just clicking the buttons for the extractors takes almost 30 minutes
support this no need to make it faster just make it less clicky
okay look me up on battle clinic whats that i fly the curse 98 of the timedont assume things i want repair systems boosted not neuts gimped neuts should still be able to disable repair systems but not with such ease
i read this before and i really dont think the 25 boost is sufficient to make a real difference when im fighting any active tank they usually get one or two cycles off before they cant keep up with the neuts anymore even with cap boosters its just stupid that buffer tanks get so much advantage over active tanks
people dont use armor reps in pvp not because only because of cap but primarily because its ridiculously slow and wastes grid that would otherwise be used for mwdab active shield can somewhat be used with a booster if theres not too too much incoming dpsif you get called primary in a fleet however no active tank is going to save you so its best to just try to last as long as you can
first off dont hesitate to report any nonconstructive replies it is actually against the forum rules but some people are unable to function properly in polite societyop what you and the linked csm proposal are suggesting would make triple repair myrmidonshyperions and xl cyclonesleipnirclaymore nigh unbeatable without staggering blobbingfor armour repairers all one needs do is make them more bursty so that the actual repair doesnt take what is a lifetime when in a pickle to take effect  increase cap consumption to balancefor shield booster there are several options tweak fittings to allow oversizing on more ships tweak boost amount or consumption and tweaking amplifiers reducing cap use alone will not make local repair any better compared to now and making the active tank bonus even bigger will just break the ships that has itnot supported
its quite ridiculous reallyits still referenced in the features page also no expert on international law however isnt it illegal to market aspects of a product in promotional material that are known not to workyou would cut them some slack if it was the first week after dominion however this is how many months nowignoring your clients on this issue over an extended period and potentiallymisleading new customers is not setting any benchmarks for first class service is it
yes hell yes i love that idea
i have no idea what your drift on this one in any mission you have the risk to loose your ship if you dont tank it properly what is it got to do with concordohhh wait i see your name and now understand its female logic talking for us it means dont try to understand the logic behind what i say just do it well no
lol thisll happen
poor carebearsi support any idea that makes the game fun
fyp no charge
810 on this troll because it hits close to home you know a lot of eve players would love this because it would let them stick it to carebears even if it would total the games economy they could grief hisec for real
i support this idea if it worked like thisselect the first extractor and set it as normal then select a copy order button or something to that effect which lights up you then single click on all the extractors you want on the same cycle which light up a little brighter then you click the copy order button again and it goes through a 1530 second routine as the extractors get set up finally you click the submit button and they are runningthis way it will take nearly the same amount of time to set the extractors just greatly cuts down on the amount of double clicking
the time consumed by doubleclicking extractors is a time wasted from all points of viewthe player is basically fighting with the interface instead of fighting other players or npc including all forms of fighting  direct engagements in space spy games in chats centwars in the market etc in addition the player character is completely safe during this operation either docked or cloaked  there is zero possibility to lose isks or property while zombieclicking extractorsin the end we have a great span of time when the real living person desperately imitates a bot or a script by clicking extractors as fast as possible and not interacting with other players at allthere are already two proposals that address this problemthe proposal for a new functionality added to the command centerthe proposal for extractor multiselectionanother approach would be to add a special planetary structure  a computation control and coordination center cccc whose sole function will be to provide an ui to restart all inactive extractors in that particular colony all inactive extractors will be reinstalled with the same cycle length the cccc interface should provide an option to select the cycle length and all extractors that were already active will not be affected and will continue with their personal cycle which allows for combining manual management of some extractors and massmanagement of othersthe ultimate goal is the same as with other proposals  to reduce the time needed to resurvey and reinstall all extractors dramatically by providing a single command that will perform all that resurveinginstalling under the hoodthe roleplay part is that cccc consumes a lot of cpu for example 6000 or even more to perform all calculations necessary to support a bunch of extractors and to control their operation the price of building such a structure should be quite high tooprosusually there is a lot of available cpu on the p0p1 planets and only the pg presents a problem  adding a cpuheavy structure will add a second dimension to the colony designthe existing structures the command center in particular are not changedthe most tedious part of the pi will be made less so but that can be seen as cons by someconsthe most tedious part of the pi will be made less so but that can be seen as pros by somethe amount of the extracted materials per time unit is not changed the need to manage other colony functions importing exporting logistics is not changed the general pi mechanics are not changed the only thing that changes is that players will have more time to interact with other players
isnt going to happen lawyers are expensive and the company is in iceland no lawyers will take the case
supported this might get rid of all the tinfoil hat people claiming ccp made plex like any other item simply for profit
this is a thoroughly stupid idea there is no difference in realmoney value between a plex and anything else in the game its all in your head first its not true that ccp do not have to honor 30 days of game time that was paid up front game time is no longer what they are selling they are selling a plex ingame item which may or may not be converted to game time and may or may not be sold for isk the idea that a plex have some sort of special realworld value that suddenly disappears when the plex is transformed into or example a ship by selling it for gamemoney and buying the ship is completely irrational second no plex is destroyed as a result of the new mechanics they are destroyed as a result of the player making the choice to remove them from the station and haul them around in space the only thing that changed is that we were previously prevented from hauling plex and now we are not but neither are we required to do so plex are ingame items now just like for example all the ships you guys lost in your failed attempt at destroying the nc would you like to suggest that ccp give money to charity for those too
i 3 this idea
by which you meant terrible ideamaybe unless someone let it sit in their inventory somewhere and quit the game or kept it for other reasons but whateverno ccp doesnt see you have no grasp of facts already right off the bat ccp sells 60 day gtcs thats it players can directly use sell or giveaway gtcs gtcs are indestructible in that they arent game items at allplayers may then choose to convert those gtcs into 30 day plex or not ccp has no say in the matter makes no suggestions or really anything else they got their money already they gave somebody the gtc their role is doneso what the exact same thing could be said of every single other item in the game all of them are worth isk potentially any of that isk could be used to buy game time those items some worth multiple times that of a plex which isnt worth much isk get routinely destroyed and always have so whatnot applicable a gtc is not a measure of general value it isnt a gift card ccp prohibits rmt theres no possibility of ever getting any cash for it legitimately its a token worth something ingame and if you choose to destroy it thats your businesslearn your facts they didnt get ganked they undocked with war targets right there they got shot by war targets who didnt even know what they had in their cargo hold and in fact popped the wreck without checking because hey who would carry anything on a t1 frigatebecause they suck or were drunkhightiredjust made a mistake welcome to eve why would someone bring an orca out to a belt in nullsec and have it sitting there without eyes in the surrounding systems why would someone think their golem could tank a full logibacked hac gang and engage etc etc i chose those because i personally saw them on the attacking side every pvper out there will have their own stories of both epic fights but also hilariously dumb moves people make mistakes and eve to an extent allows that if you want handholding online then go elsewhere people have the right to make their choices here
this people being generous with other peoples money is pretty disgusting tbhnot supported
supported ccp will make an obscene profit off destroyed plex either make then so they cannot be destroyed or donate the money from them to charity either way or ccp is nothing but greedy capitalist pigs p
no by which i meant excellent idea thus my cleaver use of the phrase excellent idea i must admit that i didnt anticipate this portion of what i wrote needing clarification quite true which is why i mentioned that someone may sit on the plex or forget they have it the point is that while a plex may go unused it still represents a potential 30 day of game time redemption and therefore looms out there as a potential liability that ccp may some day for all they know have to redeem into game timeahh well yes and no yes ccp only sells game time in packages of 60 days this much is true to which i was not being so very precise in my phrasing though truthfully they do sell 30 day of access for a certain amount of cash you simply cannot get the 30 days alone but rather you must also get it with another 30 days as well much like how hostess sell twinkies though you buy them in packages of twothe no comes in that ccp not only sells 60 day gtcs but they also sell plex directly into the game with no need to first purchase a gtc
once again strictly speaking the discussion wasnt on gtc but rather plex and either way both represent a very precise amount of value a certain amount of game time which is regularly sold for a particular amount of money all a gift card is is a barcode or magnetic strip coded number that maps to an amount of in store credit much as the gtc is only an alphanumeric code that maps to an amount or credit of the single product which is game time in eve that gift cards can be redeemed for multiple items and gtc can be redeemed for only one item is once again immaterial further many if not most retailers will not give you cash back for the value of your gift card or any unspent portion of it if they have the ability to denominate cards in any value normally the retailer will simply put your remaining value back on to another card first can you not get ganked by a war target perhaps i dont know the finer meanings and proper usage of the word gank and its derivatives though since this is not the only game that uses the term i suspect there exists a bit of fluidity in how the word is used i was using the term ganked in the sense that someone presumably quite by surprise got killed by someone else that is to say the victim did not go looking for the fight but rather the aggressor brought it to them uninvited to bad for the victim he should have been more carefulsecond that the aggressor didnt know what was in the victims cargo is precisely what i was getting at that the possibility is that the aggressor was not trying to destroy the timecards but rather that it all looks bad because it appears possible that the victim in fact was trying to put the plexs in to harms way you yourself provide to more reasons why this all looks bad why would the person fly with plex while in a corp that is wardecd and why fly in such a small and vulnerable craft again i dont think for a minute that ccp did any of this purposefully but rather only that from a pr perspective at the least it makes them look bad or at worse someone is trying to set them upbut that other possibilities exist does not preclude the possibilities that i put forward and it is precisely because the actions taken by the victim where stupid on so many levels that it somewhat supports the idea that something in their motivation was out of place but you do make the fair point that the victim could have just been spectacularly stupid of course someone spectacularly stupid who happened to have access to 22 billion isk or so either their own or their corporations the lesson dont give the village idiot access to your corp wallet or even a t1 frigate if you can help it
nofor all you charity lovers here you go linkage
because iceland is too primitive to have their own lawyersand its not like ccp has offices in other countries that might have lawyersit is true that lawyers are expensive but it is only a matter of time before 15 at a time adds up to an amount that will make a lawyer take interest in what they might be able to shake ccp down for in a settlement on behalf of a bunch of poor plebes like us
do not supportim all for ccp making money from stupid people perhaps they can use this money to fix the many problems in the their gamehowever i may support it if the op makes a similar donation to the red cross with his own money
great
trying to get the link to workoh its a very nice idea no matter how you slice it give it to charity use it to fix eve either waytoo bad neither one is going to happen instead any profit ccp makes for the next 1020 years is going to be used to pay off this idiots debts
hell big benefit is it will silence all the destroying plex is immoral threads worth supporting for that reason alone
i would support giving the money to some sort of charity
1seems like a much better solution than the money going to directly to ccpso ccp greed or good your choice

i like the idea of donating destroyed plex to charityfrom the ccp side that shipwreck that destroyed 74 plex thats 74 players for one month when theres hundreds of thousands of players paying each month that 74 plex doesnt look like much figure 320k subscribers thats 0023125 of the subscription collected in a month pretty minimaldonating the value of the destroyed plex would be a decent pr move id imagine but instead of the red cross id pick a smaller one and something that more closely resonates with gamers something like childs play
i like this

we all know the useless autotargetting system module and what it does and that is nothing usefullso lets give this module scripts and make it usefulllock all wrecks starting with closestlock all asteroidslock all droneslock all ships starting with smalleststarting with biggeststarting with furthestclosestslowestsmae class as minelock only hostile ship friendly ships neutral shipsthen the targeting system might see some use whywould anyone use it at all it could be used in a mission it could be used by a tacler so that target is locked as soon as it apprears could be used by miners could be used by salvagers some useful applications are possible if it is made more intelligent at the moment its near worthlesssome of scripts i suggested might be deemd inappropriate someone might suggest more interesting scripts if so go ahead
while mining you have a lot of time to think about things and a thought come to mind gee wouldnt it be great if the isk im getting from this was real money how cool would that bewell thinking about it some more it could be possible have two currencies in game the normal isk and lets say isd interstellar dollar the two currencies are totally independent of each other so and item brought with isk is worth nothing to and item brought with isd you can convert isk to isd with real world moneyccp can float the isd on the market and make money from it and also make money from charging services users use with the isdso you start off as a blank avatar and you then need to buy the skills ships upgrades and anything else with isd an isd character would interact with the normal isk world can kill and be killed but any isk item drop can only be picked up by an isk character and visa versa for isdfor ccp to build the isd wealth is to look at it like an asteroid is a short term deposit the wealth of that asteroid grows until some one mines it the  of profit is used to create more asteroids or other items that isd users will need ccp can employ traders to regulate the prices of ores and whatnot so there is away of making money there and the market is not flooded with useless isd item that no one wants so you wont see corps mining 10 trillion worth of ore and selling it to a space station that will never use it this will create a supply and demand and allow entrepreneurs to make isdactually you could have departments traders insurances financers just like the real world departments workof course there a lot more things to talk about and ideas to be had so will see what everyone else thinks remembering the aim is to make real money in a low risk way yet have fun doing itccp would be a bank as such but you have to earn the money by playing the game
emmm well in some sort of a way you can make real money from playing eve buying plexes to pay your account saves you the real dollars now i will not support this proposal as i dont want ccp devs wasting time on modeling and writing rules about your proposal yet focus on current issues in game besides dont think ccp will like to close their real money income from features you describedso i say neypstheres a real world out side the internet eve after all is a game no need to make it a part time job though for some individuals it is ceos alliance leaders etc just my opinion
what
ccp would require a rl bank license to do what you describe linden labs had their issues with thatif people could legally make money with eve it would become even more of a job given that people would sell in game assets for rl money and considering supply and demand youd be making very little money like it is already if you use the conversion rate gtc  isk also if you make rl money from it what about taxes it gets uglier the deeper you dig
that actually was my point
nice idea
you have my vote
ok you one of them people that dont believe in global warming as well because you cant see it if you want to see the kill mails stop bing lazy and troll bc for them i told you the set up other people have told similar stories so grow up and pull ya head out of ya aps look at sd and td wen you run a script you lose the the other one of the bonus racial jamers should only jam the race there jamming hugs and kisses
implying that a ship that cant lock can still hit the scorpion that has barely any hpalso implying that targeting and matching an ecm takes skillalso implying that to jam someone requires more skill than similar battleship tech ii modules such as weaponsthe scorpion does not take a long time to train and when youre done your ship is one of the most annoying ships to deal with
did a search for you on battlecliniccom and guess what nothing so either it didnt happen or you are using a faceless forum alt to post on the eveo forums who is the troll now youll see that i do not post with a forum alt i use my main cause i aint afraid toalso personal attacks when all someone does is ask for evidence which you should have makes you look 12 years old please refrain from it
agreedand to reply to the poster above well actually the scorpion does require more skills than the average bs since you have to skill tank  weapons like everybody else and skill ew too but thats really not importantthe fact is its ship which is easy to counter hard to master especially in fleet pvp and is hardly gamebreaking you would see a lot more of them if that was the case like it was before they nerfed ecm back then about 13rd of every battleship fleet was made of scorpions i know i was therejam chance for offrace racial jammers is already very low especially on a scorpion which has only 15 strength bonus and dont speak about td and sd scripting they affect 2 different stats or 1 stat at your choice which means they are more flexible but most importantly they work 100 of the time exactly how you expect them to and often dont even need to be bonused you see a lot of random ships with dampeners fitted you see exactly no ships well except perhaps for some noobs with unbonused ecmfinally your stories prove nothing chance is like it is chancy even if though i doubt it your 4 bss or whatever it was were killed by a lone scorpion it wouldnt prove anything except that you suck at pvp as in at most 1 bs should have died on your side before you decided to warp out and you had an incredible amount of bad luck on the chance rolls
first of all scorpion does not take long to train for you have no tank on it so no point in envesting much time into tanking skills and you dont even need weapons because you should be sitting away from battle maybe some smartbombs against drones but thats it seconds you are complaining that other ewar works all the time what you whant a jammer that works all the time you do realise how much mroe powerfull ecm is compare to target painters besides sensor dampeners cam be countered with one module one sensor booster and that module is actually usefull in something except countering ewar 2 eccms are sometimes not enougha dn if you dont meet a falcon thats wasted slots absolutely useless and there are people who fit unbonuced emc btw
ahem i hate to say this but seriously learn to play1 not fitting guns on a scorpion is silly there is no reason at all not to use them and if you do youre doing it wrong dont try to say its an ewar ship thats what it does because otherwise all the ewar ships would make sense without weapons and most probably ccp would have made the ewar modules highslot in first place2 scorpion even in its current state is basically insta primaried by any fc worth of this name range is not an issue especially since dramiels on grid probers and long range weapons are so common not putting a tank on it means youre going to die in about 10 seconds from the beginning of the fighti could add more but saying that tanking and gun skills do not count because you can not fit them is completely silly and im putting it mildlyabout the second point im not complaining that ecm is chance based im saying that what that guy was talking about the 0 chance for offrace racial jammers is simply nonsensical he was suggesting that this should be how the ecm works because tds and sds have scripts that make them go 100 on one stat and 0 on the other i simply reminded him that a scripts are optional and let you choose between 3 different modes of work b the other kinds of ewar are not chance based and thus work at the stated efficacy 100 of the time c didnt state it there but ill state it here ecm gets reduced efficacy depending on the race of the ship youre fighting while the other forms of ew do nottarget painters are ofc nerfed theyre arguably even a kind of ew that i agree but comparing ec to tracking disruption or sensor dampening is another thing didnt mention target painting anywhere in my post
well i do support this suggestion i really like the changes that are suggested as they would definitely make hybrids better however i think that i agree more with the guys above me that rather than raising optimal range on blasters i think that ccp should rather improve tracking on blasters and gallente ships ability to close range faster gallente are meant to be armor tankers but both plates and armor rigs just nerf the speed which really makes gallente useless and while for example some shield brutix doesnt have the speed problem it cannot fit a web which is pretty much required for keeping the optimal rangefix the hybridsedit oh and also fix t2 blaster ammo they are a joke

i was kinda thinking this would get more attention from some of the nullsec dwellers in here  sov seems like a pretty important topic as far as things go
also allow a mechanic to allow the transfer of a pos to another corporation without taking it down repackaging and putting up again should require ceo or director role
i think its a good idea overall but im not to keen on the whole space has to held for x amount of days to be transferred because that defeats the whole purpose of peaceful speedy sov transfers for example if an allied alliance just took over some red systems and i wanted to trade systems i had for those systems id rather be able to instantly transfer the systems instead of having to wait x amount of days if you had to wait x amount of days putting up a sbu and taking the 8 hours to online it would be fasterid propose that a sov transfer wouldnt be able to take place if a sbu is onlineing or if a sbu is online kinda like how you cant dockjump right after you agress or cant warp if you are being disruptedscrammed if x is happening y cant happenother then that id support this
so im the first to post not the first to realize that abuse of this system would be epicnote does anybody remember band of brothers and the whole director level spy issuefollowing this one would only need a director level spy and give all space to the alliances worst enemy no fight you cant dock and the whole thing would be bloodless for the first few days as everyone scrambles to refit pvp ships not supported on the basis that this would throw the political balance of eve heads up and itll never recovermidnight pheonix
nice this alone is awesome enough to support spy is part of eve letting a spy up to director level just means you deserve the consequences those larger chunks of sovnull are too static and way too peaceful thisll be fun
thats kind of what i was trying to do when i said the originating alliance must not have had its sovereignty threatened ie the system sbud in the system they wish to transfer for at least 14 days so that the system couldnt be abused in such a way that if an alliance knew they were about to lose their space they couldnt just immediately transfer it to an ally instead of letting the enemy take it the thing about holding space for a period of time before being able to transfer it sort of goes hand in hand with the above to add a little stability to the system making sure alliances can only transfer territory they truly control not just systems they take over for a day or two as a fluke at the minimum i think it should be the same 14 day period that they have to hold it without sov being threatenedsbus being anchored as for it being abused by bobtype infiltrations thats the alliances problem i think a system such as this would be an incentive for them to keep their security tight and watch their backs a little more closely infiltration and spying is a part of eve and this would be no different
the original wiki demonstrates that this was passed by the csm with no decent con arguments made in this thread there seems to be just as many people who are posting against this idea as for it and there has been precious little on how encouraging podkills which this will no doubt do is good for evethis issue is the main issue where i think the csms method of weighing player support failed they gave us no way to tell them we think this idea stinks so the 20 who listed this among their 20 items they want ccp to do will now appear to speak for everyone the original wiki claims that this will be a better measure of damage i agree that this very limitted goal is accomplished to some extent however i would point out that when we talk about the big isk pirate implants this can lead to some very skewed results if i bought snakes 6 months ago for 15 billion and they now cost 3 billion the killboard will not know what i paid for them it might post 3 billion even though i never would have paid that much for them the variations on the values of the pirate implants is quite a bit larger than the variation on cost of most mods i would agree that the attribute implants will be the mainstay for this  and their prices dont swing as much i am just pointing out that when it comes to the pirate implants the damage totals will be pretty skewed the main problem remains that the increased emphasis on podkills will just be another discouragement to getting new players into eve pvp i dont think that is good for eve
this tbh
soooeve is fine huh is that why you started this threadplease respond to the multiple choice question belowi cromo effect am a a complete forum trollb a barely functioning mental degeneratec a complete douchebagd all of the above
lolwat
why the hell are you proposing something that doesnt even existyour making assumptions over something that isnt even outare you trying to be a total noob because your doing a fantastic job
ccp was on the verge of implementing it that way but a very large number of people complained about the security problems it would have imposed and so ccp changed it at the last minute iirc
any system to give a character benefits from making friends will only result in people manufacturing friends to abuse the make a friend systemcommunity is built by people helping each other and making friends not by people exploiting each other for personal gain
since manufacturing friends require the person paying subscription for a new account and lining ccps coffers you can say its working as intended
i am all for this the multi select within range and drag and drop all in range from the overview is an awesome idea maybe we could even have a skill book or two that would add to the range of which you can do this too say for every level you get another 500 meters of range
no offence taken
yeah heaven forbid that the metagaming side of eve should be allowed to follow into the hallowed halls of the fanbois remember  no place in eve is safe not even in here
just from a quick glance i think that most of the hits arent to eveplayer generated content but more generic stuff
not right try to stop a blockade runner in lowsec you may succeed but well its not easythe animals should harden the  up cloak or nanofiber  wcs are your friends and dont use a valuable ship that could be worth blowing up remember that pods instawarp use them otherwise use a frigate with mwd and reapproach the gate is it that complicated people whine about lowsec travel being dengerous because they dont know how to cope with the difficulties the point is you want more people to go into lowsec and live there how can this happen the real problem is safety in empire there is a lot of passive safety being in a lowsec belt is almost like being in 00 and this means that security must be granted by groups of players as happens in 00 that is if pvp corporations dont go to lowsec it will never be populated so my idea is that we should add more meaningful and rewarding pvp to lowsec that is forcing interregional trade into lowsec and dont tell me that traders in eve are a weak category that should be saved from destruction another possibility is to add some sort of farming chances to lowsec but eventually it will not work look at lvl5s there are a lot of people that can afford a rattlesnake and run lvl5s and make a lot of money in lowsec much more than running lvl4 but they will never go there because they are alone dont add carebearfarming stuff to lowsec because carebear and farmers will never go there anywaythere is possibly one exception to this adding something unique to lowsec whose price will be driven up by the market but the problem is that this would call a lot of different forces making even more difficult to take control of the area and it could drive to an escalation that could end with 00 alliances taking control of lowsec the general problem is that if you create a thing with much real value it will call forces from all around the cluster so this unique item must be valuable but not too much ccp taght us that the only way to break the influence of powerful big alliances in such cases is to break the space as ccp did in wormholes the ability to use smuggler or hidden stargates could be interestinganother possibility is to make lowsec safer introducing concord on some spots only stations andor gates andor belts andor mission complexes but does it make any sense but this will just change lowsec into highsec
omgpirating is too easypirates should disappearmore carebear in low secwhat a boring game you are planning here come on wake up  we are in an online game and btw ccp developped such an interesting way of pvp stop killing this carebears have cloak scan wcs and uncountable ways to escape so i think theres no need to get more about thisand before talking about pirates be a pirate play as a pirate and see how carebears are protected by game mechanics see how free pvp is getting murdered in this game by people who just want to make money virtual money btw if you are bored by people who just want free pvp if you want to rat all the time or build all the time or anything else than pvp go on an offline game it will be better for everyone for gods sake and the idea of pirate mission omg do you think pirates are interested with doing missions  no they just want alltime pvp thats why they choose an online game but without blob of tens of persons as tionnals or nullsec aliance and as it is impossible in this game such ccp protect carebears they go for gatecamp etc and believe me this is not what most of them like to doso stop trying to understand what pirates want stop trying to make carebearism get enhanced stop killing pvp please
disclamer i hate the fact that jita 44 is the center of the trading universetbh the thought of hi sec highways between warring factions never seemed logical in the first place ie every empire is seperated by a one or two system wide lowsec militarized zone why should i be able to fly from minmatar space to caldari or amarr space through hisec when we are at war i would much prefer to have every empire have its major one or two trade hubs and have the interempire trade controlled by those bold enough to travel through lowsec andor the money to fly blockade runnersi do think though that allies should have hi sec trade routesedit original post seemed a little muddled

fully supported
definitely
supported fix the lag its past ridiculous now
its yes but as a quality test developer i can affirm you these people existhunting bugs is a fun job too but it take indeed more times to sometimes just make a tiny change at the right place to close a strange behavior between two unrelated packagesccp just need to invest more in their qa team but as you stated more new players  more new direct  the time the bug annoy everybodyfor eve space bugs are now the issuesif cpp dont change it will be the same for dust
this is a proposal to ask ccp to evaluate their attitudethis was all i needed to read
couldnt possibly support this more

this is a terrible idea everyone should vote it down

these changes would be great
only 1 thing any sensible person can say about these requests yes
supportedespecially for the api part which is a feature player have asked for again and again
yes ccp please 
thats good in my book fw wont be an intro to pvp if those alliances turn it into capship warfare its a little bit of a problem as it is now with corim liking to hot drop caps minnies have problems as it is getting fleets when amarr have the numbers on

im willing to bet 90 of the whining russians in this thread dont know a word of english other than signed not supported some 00 space is better than others and some is better for different purposes than other space drone regions are nice for manufacturing and not much else if it doesnt suit your style then fight for better space or leave rats should either have bounties or drop minerals drone rats drop minerals well drone compounds anyway you get the point not both or help xixra finally conquer insmother or something if you want better space
the point is not better region or not the point is cpp feature not working they know en but dont want to speak here cause there is a ru forum toothe problem is that the drone region have more bug than any other ones simply cause cpp even less listen to the russian player then the english speaking ones cpp introduced the dominion pay system but its unbalancing down the drone region cause all the others have bounties to pay cpp while chassing isk and attempting to sell more plex in the other 00 regions cpp ignored the russian community and the drones they attempted in the alloy patch and again failed and introduced new bugsthe point is not the region itself some some but the bugs in the features of cppcpp fail by the bug and really hardly in the drone region conquering an other place will not resolve the bugs
im depressed at your selfishness the only people in all of eve whod benefit from this change would be those who live in drone regions and my guess is the only people who will support this is the people who live there and their alts i dont think ccp should waste their time so you can make a few more mil isk an hour when they could be spending their time fixing hybrids and the myriad other issues that affect more then a few miners who want more iskies  or working dust and space walking
mutch of the drone region bugs are related to ccp features bugsexcept that in the drone region cpp cumulated the bugs effectsone bug increasing cause an other onedominion is not working in the drone region as in the others regionsccp simply missed the target therewe are not talking about comparing delkein to providence or geminate focus is not on the region but if cpp fix the drone region they will have to solve a lot of bugs at oncethis is how to read this thread

because youd probably like a serious reply as wellthis used to be how things worked a loooong time ago correct me if im wrong on this point and you used to be able to kill and pod fleet mates with no consequences in high secthis was changed because of people fleeting up with missioners with the promise of helping them and then killing themhigh sec missions dont pay as well as null sec ratting and in general everything pays better in low or null sec mission runners bring a very valuable and necessary infusion of cash to the game and theyre just about the only market for high value modules and implants because theres too much risk of losing them in low and null sec compared to the benefits where as another 200 tank really matters for a high sec mission runnerin short this would be bad for the game the games economy and for the player base in generalyoure free to suicide gank in high sec have fun
this option is actually very profitable ganking a 5 bill mission runner and only losing 5  6 bs in the process is something we will continue to do happily
petitioning pwnage ftw
ccp please add this issue in a future expansion
this ever took place
yes in process atm
i would like to see railguns and blasters have a small chance of penetrating some of their damage into armor every time they fire we have missiles we have projectilesi assume low velocity for sake of argument we have lasers and then high velocity railguns and blasters
how about lasers cooking your pod alive seriously this is stupid rails may need some work but blaster do not need to be even more op especially in weird ways a 1k dps brutix would strip buffer in no time that kind of dps dont need to penetrate into armor when whats above it is gone in seconds anyway
i support this idea it only makes sense that t3 emerging from wh can be used to their full potential there beyond being a quality of life issuesfor some of the most isolated people in the game it would also encourage people to actually go in whs and settle there

signed
signedalthough something about this seems futile if ccp were even remotely interested in doing the right thing they would be fixing the bugs and additional lag created by dominion instead their priority is trying to bedazzle the market with flashy gimmicks like walking in stations this is not a company who is going to pay any real attention to us

my respect for ccp would burst through the roof if they donated their winnings on plex deaths to charity  supported
i like it
supported but ccp will never do it as it costs them money they didnt make plex movable because they thought it was cool they did it because they found another way to squeeze a little more money out of us without having to do anything but process cc paymentseven if they did thisit would be just like why they actually set up plex for haiti we gave them money for gametime they donated that money in their name for a giant tax deduction not because they cared if they had no other motive other than to help haiti they would simply asked us to donate to the red cross and posted links to the various charities involved
last i read linden labs did not get a real banking license it was the mmo in iirc sweden that got a real banking license with like 60k protection from the government banking regulator linden labs did get a lot of press when they had the first person to make over a million dollars from selling virtual itemsit would be logical and i would like it but it has zero chance of ever happening in evebtw i do not understand the tax argument just because something is not officially directly convertible to cash does not eliminate the tax consequences i believe most taxing authorities would not see a difference in taxes if you gave a contract worker 2200 dollars or 2200 worth of giftcertificates or 2200 of wine for their labour so why should giving or stealing 2200 be treated differently by taxing authorities than 74 plexes kestral ftl or 42 billion isk
yeah that would be very cool so cool that eve will become overcrowded with macro miners from god knows where that will legally do rmt in eve that would be awesomejust imagine the bright future  all belts stripped from asteroids in highsec 2 hours after downtime tritanium prices for example gone up 100 massive inflation market collapses within one monththis already happened before the unholy rage by ccpalso big alliance leaders that are holding high end moons and making dozens of billions a month would get a chance to buy that lamborghini they always wanted  if they manage to fool anyone to actually buy isds before the whole game crashes how cool is thatpsget a job
issuemechanic section of the skills is needlessly overpopulated with multiple types of skills that have nothing to do with each other its as much confusing to new players as it is for veteranssolutionmake new skill sections and separate the skills that are now in mechanic into three different categories names tbd armor and hull tanking skills repair systems operation armor compensation skills rigging skills jury rigging drones rigging advanced ship and outpost production skills outpost construction cruiser constructionprosclearing up mechanic skills section to be less confusing to new characters and more user friendly to veteransconsnoneplease support and spread the word thanks for your attentioneditas suggested below there are also other skill groups that needs to be revised like shield tanking skills in a separate group from engineering skills that are dealing with capacitor and powergrid the title has been changed accordingly
10
while theyre at it they should remove shield skills from engineering saying i have x mil sp in engineering is meaningless since they could all be in capacitor all be in shield etc
that as well
now all we have to do is think of good names for all the skill groups and what skills should go where
10
yes 1
yes

good idea and best thing is that this is literally 3 lines of code to change pwill raise it for the next meeting
1 from another mm member 
10
most definitely supported though im sure we can debate a looong time on what should go wheremaybe another idea would be to introduce sub groups for instance i can see rigging as being part of the mechanic tree but they all should also be in their own tree called rigging  or maybe ship tweaking or whatnot so i propose introduce sub trees where skills can be grouped together that fit into a general category but also should fit better away from some of the thigns that also fit into this categorymechanic  rigging  armour enchancementconstructionengineering  shield enhancement  capacitor upgradesgunnery  renamed to offense maybe  projectile weapons  hybrid weapons  laser weapons  missiles  electronic warfare  capital weapon systemsthose are some i can think of from the top of my head
please god yes i would be happy to just have the shield and armor skills extracted
yes supported
why bother its not like swapping things around changes anything besides no matter where you put them someones going to whine for it to be changed again to where they think those skills belongid rather see the skill attributes changed combat toons have high perceptionwillpower but need intmem to train engineeringelectronics skills industrial toons have high intelligencememory but need to train perwil skills to fly industrial ships a change to attributes used for skills so that professions mostly require 2 skills would be more helpful it would encourage more focused characters and satisfy all those ppl that want more frequent revamps
highsec missions are already a big enough nerf to lowsec given that you can talk to an npc and hell spawn a 11 mil rat with lp and concord protection the change from this will be irrelevant especially if ccp ties risk to pvp to the bounty reward so a rat in highsec regardless of difficulty will pay less than the same rat in low or nullsec
i am all for some cruiser rats in 05 or 06 but as high sec mining has already seen quite some nerfs it should be only one cruiser in 06 and two in 05 a single hulk must still be able to tank it when actively playing with drones or kill them in time before the own tank goes boom otherwise you would nerf single players who are in a npc corp special spawns like dark blood etc can be even in a bc or a bs of course the reward is not as high in low sec but 5075k for a cruiser could be ok
5075k is what you get for cruisers in lowsec youd have to make it 2537k and even then youd be increasing salvage drops from it
hmm but in lvl 4s in 05 you get 5075k as well shouldnt this be consistent
10
1 to op and to
it should be chance based so there is a low chance of a battleship rat spawning in high sec although very low
no a etc is 30 but an etc  2 plex 1 plex is only 15 anyway this seems to be a good idea i will be more interested by using the char transfer is possible to pay by plex 
i propose that we make a type of ewar that prevents you from commanding your drones brings your gun optimal range and missile flight time except fof missiles to zero and gives you 0 mm scan resolution and targeting rangemaybe t2 ships using this type of ewar can use their ewar on 3 or 4 other ships at over 100km rangeit will be countered by a module that does almost nothing except provide resistance to this type of ewar maybe it can say make you harder to probe out but it shouldnt do something that would make you fit it if you werent going against this type of ewarto make it not overpowered dont give the race that uses it a secondary ewarish thing so no neut scram and web bonuses for this races ewar ships
we already have ewars that does this1 target disruptionmakes it so you cant lock meaning drones wont shoot unless you told them to before you were disrupted2 tracking disruption decreases guns optimal and trackingnow a kind of ewar that i wouldnt mind seeing is antimissiles seeing as thats the only way to damage that doesnt have a counter besides speed which can counter everything to an extentalso certain ships give bonuses that make the previously stated types of ewar go out to those ranges all except the missiles oneedit on second thought what you stated is pretty much caldari ewar tracking disruption tracking disrupting a ship in in essence making their scan resolution 0 making it so they cant lock anything now if they cant lock anything they cant tell their drones to kill stuff their guns to shoot stuff or their missiles to go lob out into spaceps i still like the idea of antimissile ewar
ahemobvious ecm troll is obvious dont feed it
510 because you made me laughespeshially i love that this guy is making a parody for ecm eccm is what makes you harder to probe out worthless and when you are jammed your targetting resolution becomes 0 ie you cant lock and fire
and i wondered how long it would take ccp to nerf the name of the troll
this is wrong on so many levels despite im sharing the opinion that ecm needs some nerf bat loving an overhaul the concept is just wrong the examples you chose in your post are extremely dumb to bring some more sense into your list of shipscurse 40 bonus to neut range per levelarazu 20 warp disruptor range bonus per levelrapier 60 stasis webifier bonus per levelfalcon 30 ecm strength bonus per levelso how would the bonuses be out of place the examples you linked are the ships secondary bonuses and for pilots who like to fit their ships differently read failfit fitting damps tps and tds to those ships is completely wrong because those modules dont serve any real use aside from special occasions obviouslyimo the way they should work is break locks just not for 20 seconds

supported rails need fixing but no increase to range of blasters just make blasters to be the if i ever get into range i win button
i dont see how anyone can not support this its black on white you fought bull with facts1you should think about putting this on a spreadsheet with colored fields to indicate which gun wins and where itll make the data poptry google docs  that way no one has to download anything to view the spreadsheet
i refuse to support any thread that increases rail dps rails are fine on dpsi also feel the falloff bonus on the deimos is fine simply because your argument is mute with the fact that range is not a problem on the rail deimos currently simply put i dont want cookie cutter hacs that all have exactly 81km optimals i mean wtf is the point of race at that point however i do like the change to higher alpha for rails i also like the 10 increase and higher optimals on blasters honestly i think they could use a boost on both the optimal and the fall off to where a mega can hit about 2530km optimal with blasters a with about 1520km falloff at max skills with no te or tc that puts it at similar range expectations as pulses and autos while neither matching the optimal of pulses nor the falloff of autos 2520 is my prefered choice ferox and brutix suffer the same fate as all the t1 bcs people refuse to balance them because they always throw cost at you as an excuse personally i hate that reasoning and would like for all t1 bcs to be looked at t1 bcs suffer from the stupid fact that only 1 teir was released at the start their order of succession makes absolutely no sense for instance the highest teir of ship for caldari always seems to be rail oriented except for bc class ie moa over caracal rohk over raven etc and the lower teir is always drones for gallente except for bc class higher teir is blaster ie mega over domi thorax over vexor etci could argue about the other 2 bcs as well but this is not the thread for that but then again remember ccp has 18 months til theyll consider rebalancing anyways and even then itll be half assed and not closely monitored after changing
thats a fair point at least in bubblefree lowsec what if remote ewar bursts were restricted in the same way as doomsdays being inoperable in lowsec seems a little unfair that the only way to tackle a supercap is with an unreppable cruiser which supercarriers can lockbreak off them every 45 minutesnewsflash friendly fire isnt friendlywould idiot aeon pilots nuking their own capacitor by firing off bursts willy nilly and not checking range first be a bad thing
ccp fix this
what im trying to say is that it would be pointless to have a 14 day limit on sov transfer because if an alliance wanted to transfer sov before then all theyd have to do is take it over the old way which ruins the point of instant transfers
there will be no abuse because ccp will be smart about it a give us a 24 hour timer unlike the disband allience button
may i please ask the csm members to publishlink here the proposal their will submit to ccp ccp please dont come at the meeting and say oh we havent noticed players wanted these points  we will not trust you ccp you had plenty of time to prepare a mature reaction like ok guys we can allocate x weeks of dev for this point or we will not do it ccp avoid also we are aware of it we are investigating we arent it idiotsand if the council really really hammers ccp then they will actually push items up in the log and into the development queuethe hammercheersyeay

you suffer for perfect circular logicthere is too much risk in low sec make pvp in low sec easier it will increae the presence of pvp corpooops that will increase risk in low sec and reduce population so what you get even more starving predators and even less preyand then you add your crocodile tears about how hard is to get a prey perfect
pretty close  we now have eve online  nge
support  its a great idea
the problem as i see it is not that suicide ganking is wrong or should be stopped but that the lack of consequence has led the practice to become so prevalent that everyone ios doing it the situation as it stands is that the people suffering or not establised carebear corps but new pilots who dont have much to start with and whose loss is sometimes enough to cause them to leave eve is not immune to the need for new players and while a sandbox game is and should be relatively unregulated as a rule i do think that there is a fine line here that we should be aware of a gang of gankers that make a major hauler bust worth millions should be applauded  the random bored high skill pilot blowing up new pilot retrievers  not so much i believe that some consequence should be added to prevent a valid tactic becoming a griefing tool just what that mechanism is and how to balance it i am not sure
there are consequences already in place we just choose to accept andor ignore them
you know ccp if you actually fixed the game all 300 thousand of us or so would become a greater marketing tool than anything you could ever devise except for mind control maybe p seriously if we all liked it and got others to join play dust 514 jsut think of the moneyyoud rake in this post is beyond fully supported by me and my corp

from what ive read its got nothing to do with what we want rather that ccp want to make world of evecraft where millions of fraggles sign up and boost their income dramatically my guess is that it will eventually include nice safe instances where they can pve their hearts out in absolute safety i run l4 missions loads to fund pvp but the thought of being completely safe while doing so is nearly as awful as the thought of having to go to jitaeven if every last one of the current playerbase quits theyre happy to take that hit not everyone will quit so they get that extra cash too

someone once told me pvp is concentual as soon as you undockfirst off id like to state im neutral on this subject i will neither support it because i do infact take part in suicide ganking and other unmoral acts of aggression towards others also i condemn others for doing acts of unmoral aggression that i would have nothing to do with i am in no way a hypocrite though im sure many of those that have read the previous sentences believe that i am i was raised to do on to others are others do on to you its not an eye for an eye mentality being that i wont suicide gank someone else for suicide ganking a friend if it happens to me i respond with the same likenesswith all that said messenger carebears are the minority in this game most of the current sitting csm deligates are pvpers or pirates though i dont believe any of them are confirmed griefers either way the only way to remain 100 safe in any world is to lock yourself away from all contact with anyone comparing this game to the real world on either side just gives the opposing side of your argument fuel there are two common ways to deal with a bully1 beat him up and prove your strength to himher this doesnt always work because most of the time they bully will just come back with friends and hurt you again2 ignore it and walk away from the fight believing that your the better person this never works because the bully knows that eventually youll crackthere are other options for you to choose from but that is the most common as for your purposal i do aggree with one thing and i believe even some of the pvpers aggree with it from my reading of other posts and tahts the fact that the insurence still pays out even after concord has destroyed the ship what you need to do first is take a step back from the game and ignore the flames come from the pvpers and rewrite your purposal with a bit more of a nonbasis view incorporate changes that would benefit both groups adding more security for ships that fly in high sec but also in turn offer a way to bribe concord sec status so you could esentially pay concord for a 10 sec status rather then having to grind your way there in so doing taking on the same risks that the carebears have but also allowing the carebears more security by having a greater punishment of not giving the suicide ganker an insurence pay outon other note i would like to physically see where ccp has announced that they want this game to harbor hatred and discontent between its players and that they encourage the dissatisfaction of theyre subscribers also that the game was primarly designed to be a purely pvp game and that its the intent of ccp to keep the game purely pvp if you can provide this documentation i would be greatly appriecative as im sure many pvpers wouldnt mind having that information to snuff out any further tears that arrise from carebears in the future please keep in mind if these are not formal documents and or if you state that you are speaking on behalf of a company of which you have no employment with andor can not prove your allogations of ccps wants and wishes you need to refrane from doing so being that it could cause legal issues for not only ccp as a company but you as well
i wouldnt want to kill someone in real life because of the emotional trauma it would cause me and their loved ones that is called empathy normal people have empathy what you are describing is a lack of empathynot having empathy means you are a sociopath however sociopaths have really successful lives i wish you good luck with it charles manson jeffery dahmer ted kaczynski and timothy mcveigh  all famous people
has to be said again and againthe game is designed for you to loose your ship regardless of where you are wanting to be safe somewhere is against the intention of this game the only issue at best is balance issue aka suicide gankers havehad it too easy with the recent insurance changes they need to make sure their target is more valuable then before then there is also the possibility of someone suicide ganking you for the fun of it thats essentially the very foundation of eveeither grow some balls or find a new game to play
i see everyone wanting to support this and i agree that it would be nice if you find yourself in a bit of a pickle but am i the only one that likes the idea of being able to chase a red around a sytem rather than just reporting he warped to no wheresorry not supported
support i need that
yes
hell warp to a planet at 70 or a bm just the same so it doesnt really affect that he can align to a moon warp in at range and then safe up so doesnt really make that big of a differenceplus id like to point out if you have someone scanned out you could align to that place and wait for a tackle and instawarp in

yesterday i experienced a major fault when dealing in my niche shuttlesthe actions by the game alleeged some totally different transactionsthan those i had tried to enter  i have played 3 years  made many mistakes along the road  and have learned by bitter experience to be careful  and was especially careful when entering these specific data  i attempted to enter sell orders in very low volume at 19900 isk piecei did this 3 times in succession at the same station but nothing happened i had entered succesfully  the same order in a station in the same solar system  with the same corporation but with different planetary location  approx 3 minutes prior to this i then became suspicious and when looking at other screensit suddenly appeared that i had sold first 128 shuttles at 5 isk per piece to someone else and then in succession first bought 238 shuttles at 5 isk per piece from myself  and then again sold 238 shuttles to myselfi have no explanation for what happened i have petitioned it but recieved a response which to meindicates that the petition team hasnt investigated this at allthe only thing i can say is that as it happened to me  well then it could happen again for anyone thereby in realitypulling the carpet away under the whole game i hereby  in the interest of all  ask for some assistance in getting to the bottom in this eventulf raben

make deployed secure containers in space show anchoringunanchoring timers and status just like pos structures
yea so is fixing rockets but it takes ccp years to do that i think its wasted effort and they would be better off fixing something that actually needs fixing rather than messing about with the ui and potentially breaking a load of stuff in the process not supported
actually this will require 0 lines of codeim quite sure that skills like any static data like this is stored in the database along with what group a skill belongs to so all that is needed is someone to come up with a better groupsubgroup setup that makes more sense and divides things better and then enter this into the database for the next patchonly code requirement would be for the display to be able to handle the skills and groups like a tree instead of a flat table with sub entriesmy estimation as developerdesign new skill listgroupssubgroups 46 hoursalter database 2 hoursrewrite skill table as tree 46 hourstesting 4 hourscreate patch data for deployment 1 hour
this idea was initially inspired by a post that ana vyr made herethe local channel would be an information network providing the communication ids of the pilots in the same system as you this network is maintained by the corporation with sovereignty and is shared with pilots at the corporations discretionhow pilots get on the local networkn1 a pilot uses a stargate to enter the systemn2 a pilot can be scanned from a celestial or stargate in the systemn3 a pilot is docked at a station in the systemn4 a pilot uses the local network for communicationn5 pilots remain on the local network for a period of time after appearing on it regardless of rule n2  exceptions to these rules in systems with concord present  e rule n2 restrictions do not apply in systems where concord is present becauseea concord can scan at infinite rangeeb concord can scan cloaked shipshow pilots access the local networka1 be friendly towards the sovereign factiona1a for npc corporations this could require various standing requirementsa1b for pc corporations this would require an interface for the corporation to provide other corpsalliances accessa2 hack a network nodea2a this could include using a hacking module from your shipa2b this could include anchoring an object in spacea3 a pilots that uses the local network for communication would appear on your personal network even if you dont have access to the local networkhow this affects high sec systemsh1 all pilots in system are shown in local for pilots on acceptable terms with the sovereign factionh1a pilots with standings below the required amount and pilots in faction war with the sovereign faction would not have access to the networkhow this affects low sec and null sec systems with a sovereign corporationl1 all pilots appearing on the network are shown in local for pilots on acceptable terms with the sovereign factionl1a pilots with standings below the required amount and pilots in faction war with the sovereign faction would not have access to the networkl2 rule n2 would prevent pilots in a deep safe and cloaked ships from appearing on localhow this affects uncontrolled null sec systemsu1 no local network exists  works like wormhole spacediscuss paraphrasing points brought up in this threadxorv allow for a pilot to hack the network to temporarily disable it post
so cloaked ships in nullsec stay off the local network however since they uncloak to jump into a system or undock etc they will initially be on the local network until some sort of timer expires and they drop off the networkpirate npc faction nullsecs local network access is dependent on standings with that pirate factionif the answer is yes to all of those i like your ideai would add that for player controlled null sec the local network should actually be an anchored structure that can be destroyed and requires frequent fuelingthat for low sec good standings with the local npc pirate faction should also give access to a the local networkas you kind of alluded to it should be possible to use the hacking skillmod to either temporarily access or disable a local network maybe not in highsec though or at least not without the faction navy attacking you
first question if the cloaked ship came through a stargate they would be in local for a period of time yes if they were to come through a cyno or covert cyno and remained cloaked not necessarilysecond yes if you were in guristas space and wanted access to their local network you would need standings with themi also love the idea of hacking the network to temporarily disable it i previously hadnt thought of that and it is something that i feel would add to the potential encounters in null secabout making the network destroyable or requiring fuel the local network would be maintained and transmitted by the stargates and stations within a system i dont feel it would be necessary to require an additional structure beyond the tcu to gain sovereignty to control access to the network since the tcu doesnt require fuel i dont see a reason for the network access to be any different
propose changes to concord remove automatic concording replaced with a distress call buttonhighsecmust press distress call button after being attacked for concord to show up after a short timer thats appropriate for systems sec status afkbots are free to killlowsecafter sending distress call much much longer timer before concord shows up timer visible to pirate concord dont give chase pirate is free once warped off grid no need to repackage etc whether successfully popping target or not before running out of time and warping off makes no differencefeel free to criticizeflame
cant wait to get 100 alliance friends to all distress call in front of jita 44 the concord ship spam would be awesome
button only works after being attacked it was stated in original post although not clearly sorry about that
id say the macros would just adjust their macro shouldnt be too hard to auto press a button whenever shield drops below 75 or so so in essence youre only screwing over the people who need to afk for a rl issue and the freighter pilots who frequently afk auto pilot because hey even at the keyboard it can take 30mins for a haulpersonally id think the idea would cause more issues then it helps it looks more like a change for the sake of change and knowing ccps track record itll be bugged and half decent for months before they fix it by that time god knows how many highsec bears cancelled their accountill say it sounds like a fun idea but in the end itll cause more issues then it fixesnon
it wasnt actually intended as a block for macros macros those days are so advancedcolor sound recolonization etc theres no way to block them aside from putting pass phrase on everythingi had 2 intentions in mind first was to make concording mechanics more intelligent discourage afk at the same time it lets player decide whether to concord or not someone rr you but hit weapons by mistake theres the choice to not concord same goes for fof missile hitting the wrong place webbing freighters for faster warp ecm burst hitting neutrals when defending convoy during wardec and many other scenarios as for afk freighter hauling it can be alleviated somewhat by being able to web it for fast align by any toon not necessarily in same corp without automatic concording i dont think anything in a game should be completely afk preventing this is one of the purposes of this proposal for good or illthe 2nd intention was to smooth out security difference between high and lowsecaka lolsec pushing the relative risk between them closer together and populate lowsec without converting it to highsecas for ccps bugs yeah its rather sad but that applies to all proposals on the board nothing will ever get done if starting from that basis
concord we aint got no concord we dont need no concord i dont have to show you any stinkin concordwe like lowsec police mechanics the way they are thanks go back to carebear heaven there are far more important things to fix in lowsec than spawning concord ffs
supporting the part about highsec
looks like all the potential problems are related to highsec changes just keep lowsec distress call and keep highsec as islolsec is empty cant get a fight there even after roaming or camping for hours and the pirates fight each other more often than anyone else gotta support your pirate alt with another toon with a real profession distress call might bring enough people to make pirating profession viable the timer just have to be long enough for the pirate and short enough for the pirated
this can be fixed by making rat bounties depend more whether or not theres a serious risk to pvp in the system than on the difficulty of the npc so the same rat in a highsec mission could pay out maybe a third as much as that rat in low or nullsecbefore you say that missionbears will quit the game the content of the missions would stay the same theyd just pay out less in bounties if theyre in highsec
thats level 4s where you need to grind standings anyone can go out to a belt and shoot rats though
risk to pvp vs reward not work grinding vs reward should determine isk
as the game is no longer pure pvp you cant take pvp as a single orientation for isk earning in fact as we are talking about npc rats a determination about how the pvp vs reward ratio should be is totally wrong placed id say the topic about bounty hunters could be a place for that
id support this on one condition ccp doubles rat bounties in null
which is why cruiser rats in hisec should be less per my point although as someone who does rat in lowsec you have very little risk of pvp if you pay attention
supported seems like a good idea to me

while i can see your point of view this creates other problemsme for example i run 7 accounts down from 10 and each account was started using he buddy program then plex card to activatehad i had to use a credit card or other real money transfers then none of my extras would have come to life each account is now between 12months  3years old so in terms of lost cash just on 12months thats 72 monthly payments ccp would have missed out im just one person but i know of at least 10 others in my alliance who would be in same boat

fraps or it didnt happeni love these stories about being permajammed when what they really mean is i was afk during a fleet fight
ideatech 1 jammers chance to jam a single highslot weapontech 2 jammers chance to jam two highslot weaponsyoud need 4 tech two jammers to potentially jam a full 8 rack of weapons weapons are randomly chosen only online weapons can be jammed eccm reduces the chance as per normal rulespersonally id say my idea is pretty brilliant and i deserve a cookie for it
yeah was a horror  but it was also before ecm was changed so that a majority of the power is tied to the ecm boats in the form of bonusesif it was point based you would need 23 nonbonus jammers to take out a single frigate and would have no hope against anything larger without seriously gimping yourself  i think it at least merits consideration
thread cleaned of some trolling please try to post in a constructive matter
you should really update the cons section of that proposal to accurately and fairly reflect a lot of the feedback provided in the assembly hall thread  that this change removes a level of choiceconsequencedepthplanning from the character development process that many players feel is a positive aspect of the learning skills and the loss of that choiceconsequencedepth planning is undesirable i posted this suggestion in the main thread some time ago

i approve this proposal
supported even tho ccp still imho does an awesome job bringing us free and superb expansionsbut seriously dont ever listen to what companies tell in their commercials and presentationsapple and ms are preaching for years that they invented something new and revolutionairy even tho its still the same shiet in another color
all you guys are the biggest cry babies gimmi this gimmie thats5boo freakin woos5ccp does a great job with all the free expansions and stuff every few months but yet you still complaini for one am looking forward to incarna and dust514 i am exstatic that dust will not be on the pc too many cheaters using aim bots and stufflearn to play the free content instead of constantly complaining ccp will get to all that stuff when they get to it
you got something on your nose

not supported if you cant handle learning skills eve isnt the game for you go play wow with all the other impatient childrenif they have to mess with the learning skills give every new player lvl 3 in all learning skills like it said in the evelopedia page i wont be happy but it wont ruin the game eitheri wanna be a physicist without going to schooli wanna be a truck driver without getting my cdl
how many learning classes have you taken in real life in eve if you want to be a physicist you can learn science and physics we dont have trucks in eve but if you want to fly an industrial ship you learn the appropriate piloting skills in space ship command so wtf are learning skills theyre a time sink nothing more theres no real correlation with learning things in real life before you post next time i recommend you take a basic reasoning class because like most of the pro learning skill posters your arguments are terrible and make no sense but if you really think it would help ask at your local collegeuni if you can take the learning class instead
yes learning skills should be removed they kill interest from majority of new players i tried eve trial like 3 times before i actually started playing it for real and out of the 3 times i always quit because i didnt want to waste my whole trial for learning skills first time i tried the game was in 2003 or 2004 and i finally subscribed on 2009 just because i somehow was able to accept the fate of not being able to do a  for a month or soso if you want new players remove them if you dont care for new players then just leave it like this
irony is a kb
amazing work kudos csm 
messenger i can agree with you on a couple of points it hurts to lose a ship in eve that youve worked so hard to build by yourself and it doesnt make sense that concord would pay insurance for ships lost in a criminal actthat being said this is eve a dev once said that eve is not built to resemble a cold dark cruel universe  its built to be a cold dark cruel universeyoure now in one of the hinge points that discern those built to play eve and those not if you learn from your mistakes learn how to survive and keep a good buffer to provide should your ship get lost youll do fine in eve if you want to whine about how cruel the universe is this game may not be the ideal one for younow dont get me wrong im a blueblooded carebear who doesnt engage in pvp for my own reasons however this game is a sandbox and sometimes bullies will come over and destroy the sandcastle you built even if it costs them a whuppin from their parentsthis is eve its not player vs enemyenvironment its not player vs player its everybody vs everybody eve its also not everybodys game so we wont feel hurt if you decide its not your game

works for me its always an utter pain in the  when you get back into sisi and have skills on tranq but not on sisi
man i have wanted something like this for a while

will benefit ccp a lot as most people will be able to test a wider variety of modules and ships thus increase the potential for bug discovering supported

this way i will actually want to test
something like this would be nice yes its important that people be able to test things with skills they may not have but 5 mil isnt so much that people will just go crazy and never play on tq
consequences will never be theno wait no youre still going to be an idiot
hi  thanks for the  nice  postsit always wonders me that anyone can spare the time torespond with nonsense and invectivesbut i can close this thread as it appears that i myself must have been the culprit having confused the pricebox with the quantity box  and even if i to the best of my knowledge can not recollect anything like thatthe petition team did a very thorough investigation on the subject and all facts point to myself 
responding to nonsense with nonsense seams logical
just like bookmarks it would be nice if players could drop notes that theyve written with the notepad into cans or their hangerbecause smack should be persistent

great work trebor a lot of time and effort went into this its a damned shame more people couldnt be bothered to take the time to add their votes so that the percentages would have been more meaningful my pet option  55 sorting of corp assets  got one vote mine even though i hear corp ceos and players responsible for gathering those assets from market orders complain all the time about how tedious and inefficient it is there are plenty of other ones on that list that should be higher tooah well ccp probably wont listen anyway but again trebor nice work
there is an issue with corporations alliance hopping right when standings are fully set against thier new alliance they bail from that one and create a brand new alliance just to cause confusionit is unnecessary and only done to try and grief and make up for their lack of skill in 00
strange ppl would pay quite a chunk of change just to cause confusion besides if youre confused by something like this maybe you deserve to be confused
what
its better argued and more eloquently put than most of the other ideas in the assembly halls first page so ill support it even though i dont know what the  you mean i didnt like the bold text part though
just go nbsi instead of nrds problem solved no confusion it is grey you shoot it it is orange or red you shoot it too let them waste isk on creating new alliances
he is mostlikely trolling over corporation alliance and organization discussions  d00m joins ncthough i am not sure he is an nc or doom alt
doesnt it cost like 1 billion isk to create an alliancethats a chunk of isk for me and i wouldnt do it foreverand if the reply is  1 billion isk isnt alot of money for them then welcome to eveyou can do whatever you want with isk
they are the nc they have tons of isk from carebearing 237

i am surprise nobody mention that weapon upgrade should have been under electronic affecting cpu usage advanced weapon upgrade should have been under engineering affecting powergrid usage not under gunnery where they are both currently right nowthere is no technical reason for grouping both weapon upgrade under gunnery because in the social skill you have skill that require nonsocial skillsbut otherwise i agree with everyone in here
supported
makes sense
the skills menu needs a complete rework im not quite sure the layout your propose is enough a search featureim thinking more along the lines of how evemon does it when you click on a skill it expands what other skills are attached then links to items which are unlocked by learning the skillits something that wouldnt take too much time in terms of coding to implement but severely needs a rework the current system is well frustrating
i agree that a skill menu rehauling wouldnt be bad but fixing the groups would help though tbh the skills under engineering are so few without shields that i can understand why they put them there p
supporting my own topicyall know dissenting points are welcome
or the pirate scum could just do something productive rather than be bottom feeders
dittono to the low sec part
my point is that not only should highsec belt rats and mission npcs be weaker and thus pay out less but the same rat in highsec should pay less than the same rat in low or nullsecso say blood corpus dread follower a rat i made up to illustrate a point rat pays 60k now with my reforms it would only pay 60k in lowsec and should a blood corpus dread follower turn up in highsec it only pays 30k
thats already the case with belt rats if you mean missions you arent thinking nerfing mission payout is not going to help pvp because a lot of pvpers rely on it to fund and plex ships they need that stable non pvp risky income to replace ships or to buy things from pvp people so they can buy plexesnerfing mission rat payout is not going to drive people into pvp systems if it does they will just join fw and use those missions and focus on lp
you can allrdy upgrade links why not exstractors space ports and factorys this will reduse the number of buildings good for the server  less clicks good for usop in features and ideas discussion
upgrading extractor and factory  no because pi stuff of all tiers will drop price drastically upgrading storage facility and launchpad  yeah why notbut i dont see the point of posting pi modification ideas anyway except tweaking whats already implemented like ui for example since this is only the first iteration of planetary interaction and we can not know what is ccp planning to do with it

just wait when you want to change ships you need to walk to another hangar ontopic advertisement is probably the main reason were getting incarna so no need to advocate this
how would you feel if incarna featured real life advertising as a way to support ccps hardware infrastructure betrayed 1 there are ads on the internet tv magazines billboards walls sidewalks you get spammed with ads in your email regular mail and if you live in a remotely urban environment chances are that you cant walk 200 meters without someone shoving a flier in your hand advertising some total crp that you dont want or need this is a game ffs  a place where you can relax and enjoy the immersion in the virtual world2 when i play the game im playing the game theres nothing that can make me think about buying some junk while im playing3 even if i am interested to look at ads inside the game you must realize that eve is a global game 90 of the stuff that would be advertised wouldnt even be available to me or anyone living outside us because we all know that mainly us mega stores and hyper capitalistic corporations will be the ones that would buy the majority of ad spaceis there any kind of realworld advertising you feel would be appropriateeve related stuffif you disagree with any kind of realworld advertisement would you support station advertisements for everated sites eve related sites ccps promotions eon eve store items those would be just fine if ccp wants other things to advertise their marketing dept should do their job for example make a special discount deal with some global computer shop for eve tuned pcs and gaming gear keyboard mouse headsets  but only for customized eve products relevant to the game and not some generic junk or something thats not related to eve like deodorants
ill support it if it lowersremoves my subscription fee
it wouldnt the additional revenue would most likely translate to a larger development team working on the game which would be awesomethat being said the player base of eve isnt large enough or centralized in any way that would create a good market for advertising
dont you mean a larger development team for dust
thats alot of work in this thread
soooo a q about the learning skillswhats so bad about themwill we get the sp trained in them spread between skills we want
if we get a refund on skill points already trained in learning skills i would get a whopping 442040 sp back to reallocate ala the server downtime recently
and what about the ones that put a couple months to train them to lv5 id like that sp put into something else if ccp is gunna  up the attribute system like the rest of stuff the change
essentially the problems of low sec are a symptom of the greater problems with eve at large chiefly unbalanced risk vs reward and to a lesser extent also alts and as a result the absence of consequences matching actions theres few reasons to be in low sec where somewhere else wouldnt be better for most low sec is somewhere you pass through from high sec to null sec or its a kind of battleground where they get to have fun pvping fueled by the isk they made elsewhere but mostly its just empty underutilized spacei dont think theres a fix for low sec that isnt a fix for the whole game and thus major changes i would start with the following1 high sec needs to made much less appealing than it is currently as a place to generate isk remove most combat missions complexes and exploration sites from high sec some level 1 combat missions could stay for newer players as well as wormhole entrances for exploration2 low sec needs to be made both more profitable and somewhat safer a place to generate isk  all the remaining combat orientated agents moved to low sec pirate faction stations placed in deep parts of low sec some npc stations given more fire power to defend themselves and aligned players including orbiting navy ships in some cases faction corp and concord standing now used for station access whether a station requires faction or concord standing to dock will depend on the npc corp controlling it giving some variety in levels of security require  20 standings with faction and corp to dock 50 or worse station and orbiting npc ships will attack the player3 null sec needs to remain profitable but also be more attractive to pvp seekers and pirates that currently occupy low sec and arent part of major null sec alliances remove local chat or at least adjust it so its not such an easy intel tool apply faction standing and improved station defense changes above to pirate npc stations in null sec change the jump in point from a gate from 15km range to a 150km range in a full 360 degree around the gate removing whats possibly the tiest pvp mechanic in eve zone camping can still camp gates on the warp to gate side applies to all gates not just those in null secnotesthe goal of standing and station changes is to give player a safeish base to operate from empire faction aligned players can dock and undock from their mission running stations with a degree of security in low sec pirates can choose to align with the local npc pirates and have bases to operate out of in low sec and npc null sec also gives standings and the choices players make with them have more meaning than they currently doi would like to see standing automatically drag players into faction war but fw needs a complete overhaul all on its ownthe arguments for and against local chat removal are already well knownthe change in the jump gate mechanics i think is needed because it would encourage players to travel more through low and particularly null sec more pirates in null sec is less pirates in low sec in the absence of prior intel or meta gaming using through away alt scouts jumping through gates is a basically a roll of the dice where if you come up short and run into a large gate camp your almost certainly going to die it favors the lazy and the blobers merely the fact its poor game play is reason enough to remove it
so your idea of the new player experience isget a cruiser mining in a noob frigate in high sec or trading with your starting 5000 isk or running level 1 mission and the lose it to a guy with a bs as soon as you enter low sec what you want is a different game but to have that game require as first thing to remove all accumulate wealth and sp from the current players or a new server both things will remove the persistent wordpart of eve and destroy it
why not allow players to get a limited version of sov for lowsec systems where they pay to the respective empire to rent the system and act as the police there it would allow some of the larger empire corps to move into lowsec and feel comfortable running missions im not talking about fw stuff but other lowsec systems we already pay for the right to anchor towers in low and high sec systems so let the players pay to be the police as well reblier as an example would still belong to the gallente federation but it could be governed by a player corp or alliance
no not at all if you read the entire proposal you would see that gatecamping in lowsec would become pretty much a waste of time in most cases so the newbie in a frigate would have to be very unlucky or very newbishdumb to get killed by a bs the moment they enter low sec the changes make low sec much safer than it is presently aside from that it would make low sec way more populated and obviously an empty system is safer than a crowded onei believe all the major isk faucets into the game should be in a pvp environment and subject to risk as is the case with all other sandbox pvp mmorpgs not as it is with most themepark mmorpgs where pvp and pve are often clearly separated it has taken innovative strategies by players in eve like mass empire wardecing suicide ganking afk cloaking in null sec can flipping and ninja looting etc to drag eve away from that eqwowish model but really its not enough i dont agree that any of your requirements are necessary to make these changes i also believe that my changes would be a step in making eve feel more immersive and give more substance to eve as a persistent world
i read most of it enought to be well mad i agree with a lot of other paying customers here the thing that was stated over and over from ccp in this meeting was we are doing this for the next 18months no matter how well you try to convince us otherwise we may start to consider your concerns a year and a half from nowwow w t f is the csm for i absolutely commend this iteration of the csm for putting it to ccp and representing the concerns of the player base very well unfortunately for all of us ccp just gave them the finger i can promise you that players canceled their subscriptions after reading those minutes this meeting proved that ccp is going to do what they want regardless of outside influence and im still waiting to hear what is going to make incarna worth 3 years of development and degraded game qualitypolish for the next 18 months you cant do anything meaningful outside of your ship so why has this feature taken up so much time and resources especially at the cost of previous expansions that have been abandoned in unfinished states
cheers ccptamber
cheers tamber for another thread about this
no it got changed yesterday your csm tax dollars at workthe dirty deed was done by ccp capslock who now bitterly regrets going out drinking with the csmcapslock those photos of you drinking nonalcoholic beer have been deleted as promised honest

 supportedyou know when i was a newbie i wanted to train for some ships a little catalyst later a thorax and since i wasnt in a corp no one told me about learning skills so i had wasted all 16m sp bonus in training skills i could have got 1000 faster if i trained learning skillsreimburse or just make the sp vanish dont care but its completely stupid to train skills that will make you train other skills fasterreading a book doesnt make you read the next one faster
issue passed 54 after much spirited debateif ccp does decide to change learning skills we hope they will do it in close consultation with the csm

sounds good supported
actually there is it just happens to be the same reason as not maxing out everything for everyoneccp freely give skills when they need something specific tested if a large chunk 5m is a bloody large chunk is added to everyone it is going to be unproductive sessions with loltastic cap fights all overby all means add the 200k or whatever it comes out to before a mirror is live after being snapped but 5 million bad ideanot supported way to high

im a fan
this is a good idea and shouldnt be too hard to implement
not too much to explain hereit will be nice to have some npc run games to fall back on if youre at a station with not many people i also think that a lot of people would enjoy these games as well besides the suggested texas holdem at any rate i think adding these games can only add more variety to the sorts of gambling games available
i believe the problem with this is the number of gambling laws around the world

not supportedif you want isk then work for itperhaps petition to limit accounts to only 1 character to be able to get involved in pi or datacore researchno other game gives so much freebies for so little effort and that needs to be changed in order to avoid pussiefication of the game
this issue has been deferred until the next csm meeting so that csms can do a filtering pass on the results of the crowdsourcing afaict the csm is in favor of the proposal but we want to take the time to present the best possible list to ccp

to me it seams that the only players who dislike this idea are the pirates themselfs  and they can go drink a can of quaff some where else honistly if your in low sec and you cant pop the indy thats calling for help before concord gets there your doing it wrong as well as the fact that concord in low sec wont chase you again your doing it wrong and so freaken what about if one or two managed to get concord to show up and you cant pop them  guess what theres probly gona be 10 more around some time soon so in a way this helps the pirates out much more targets for hunting
if the upgrade costs the same as adding another akaa tier 2 extractor has the same pgcpu usage as 2 t1s and the same output it just saves clicks wouldnt increase available resources
yes exactly
while i will have t say goodbuye to my cool loocking branched networks if i heave to click less sure
as the proud owner of 15 coloneys i would love to see the some 234 clicks i have to make to keep the flow going reduced down to a much more managable number
currently you are only able to train 1 character per account what i am proposing is to allow for the training of multiple characters however ccp has most likely done this because with the current state if you want to train multiple characters at a time you need multiple accounts which means multiple subs thus more money for ccpwhat i propose is that ccp allows us to pay a extra fee to train multiple characters per account so the sub fee is 15 per account per month and that allows you to train one character what i want to see happen is the ability to pay say 5 or 10 more per month to train an additional character per account so 5 or 10 per additional character so if you wanted to train all 3 character slots it would be 25  35 per month depending on how much is charged the only snag i see is how it would be done with plexs the solution for that is to add a system to designate a main character per account so the base plex gets applied to that character then add another item in game similar to plex but a little cheaper that you use for the 1s on the account not the main of course people will say why not just make another account but some people dont want to have multiple accounts the only way i can see this being abused is if people were to mass train characters then sell them for iskrl cash but its really no harder to do now it just requires more accounts and a little more money than i am proposingeither way i think this would be a good way for ccp to make a little extra  from customers and some people may really benefit from itdiscuss
i read the title and instantly went noafter reading the proposal im leaning more towards yes but not entirelythe extra character training should cost less than a full account as one cannot run 2 chars off the same account or morehowever im still very unsure if im liking this idea or if i find it a silly ideasorry ts i just dont know
hmmm an interesting idea training multiple characters on one account for what amounts to another subscriptionthis would allow players to diversify their character account exploring multiple skill tree avenues without having to go the more roundabout method of setting up another accounti could support this if an addendum is added multiple accounts would not be allowed per personwithholding vote for the moment
i think we found the most stupid idea in the whole eve online forum
what youve just proposed is that ccp gives up a big chunk of their monthly profit which is not going to happenthe only way this could happen is that you must pay additional 15 per every character you want to train a full subscription but then again you could already do it now with a second account but even if they consider adding 15 per trainable character they must do a total overhaul of gtcs plexes database backend paying options automatic credit card billing system so just create another account its much more easy and it doesnt waste anyones time
not necessarily there should be some people out there that would pay for training more characters per account but not willing to go as far as setting up 2nd account there are also many majority of multiple account holders who dont use their multiple accounts purely for training but also play dualboxing over them 2 chars from one account cant log on at once if both of those groups are large enough ccp is looking at a gain in profit potentially a large one
that is the answer i expected fro mmost people you are right hotugh it is just as easy to train another character on a new account tbh i am not exactly sure why i came up with this idea in the first place i still do think it is another way for ccp make money mostly because if people want ot dual box they use two accounts but if they want to train say a hauler alt they can do it on one for less money or if they want to say hav ea titan pilot and cap pilot on one account and then another account with a cap pilot or sub cap pilot they can train all of the characters at once instead of only 2
ok put this idea together after watching a few gundam shows and a few other shows as well the weapons pod drone classrequired modulespod launcher  high slot item only useable on industrial class ships includes transports and orcacycle time 15 secondseffect deploys x loaded weapon pods at a random location in a orbit 3k around your ship holds x1 wpods but instantly loads more x is skill dependant but will always be 1xthe weapon pods themselvesthere are 4 sizes of wpod respective to current weapons and they range in size from 25 m3 in size in respect to use they are like sentry drones they dont move just shoot they will last for 3 shots which are fired in quick succession or x12 seconds with x being skill basedthey will show up in drone control so you can tell them what to shoot but will keep firing should you leave grid the wpods like all drones can be shot and have very little hp as they are essentially the ammo and the aiming device with a few thrusters to actually aim should a wpod be launched with out a designated target it will aquire one itself based on who has aggressed you or who you have aggressed prosindustrial specific pilots will be able to handle combata group of indies is no longer helpless if attacked some may be packingunlike regular drones there is no limit to the number of wpods you could have deployed though due to their die off timer or fire count you could have max of 20 and no moreconsdue to the ammos size can only be used on industrial ships and unless modified for cargo will run out faster than other weapon types a standard cruse missile is 005 m3 while the pod that carries three is 4 m3requires the highly coveted high slot that most indies only have one ofsmart bombs would easily dispatch whole groups of wpods
sorry but i can see this being abused to hell and back especially since you have not defined how powerful such drone pods would bewould they be on par with say warrior iis in their damage dealing abilities less than your intention is to give industrial ships the ability to fight back against what frigates cruisersif they were to be weaker than warrior iis then they would not possess the ability to defend the industrial that is using them remember even a well tanked industrial will pop fairly easily if they are just as strong or stronger than warrior iis then it would essentially be giving industrial ships way more power compared to pure combat ships especially en massthis is similar to an idea that was posted in the features and discussions board where you may have wanted to test the merit of your idea first where someone asked if industrials could be given small drone bays with which to defend themselves to me this just seems to be a more roundabout way of asking for thatnot supported
nice idea but i bit over the top why not use sentry drones they are allready in gameor gun towers in your cargo hold these to are allready in game add a gun tower skill and donei do a gree that industrial pilots could use some more ways to protect them selves though
if you whant indies to protect themselves jsut give them drone bay simple
if you want indies to protect themselves just dont travel without an escort simple
someone who dont know game mechanics unless you bring a whole blob with you and gank the whole camp instantly they would just pop the hauler fast and deal with your escort afterwards
ecm logistics any of that ringing a bell
wont work camp will still bust your indy first and fast theres a reason ppl dont escort indies only viable option is transport
dont take this the wrong way but im pretty sure that i have actualy answered this questionif that does not explain it here goes if you use the cruse missile wpod it will fire 3 cruise missiles total at its target in quick succession so about a 24 second delay between shots then blow up as i dont use t2 drones i cant compare themand secondly there are 4 sizes of wpod  kinda like the weapons we allready use and they will target there size class first  small wpod vs frig large vs bs
supported this should be in page 1
ok there has been a lot of talk about pi and various ideas for it so i figured id two in my 2 centsfirst part may surprise you triple all command centers power grid and cpu before you blow a gasket there a reason all colonies will be required to defend themselves from space born attackersevery building you own will project a 50km control zone around itself that blocks neutral or hostile factions from placing buildings links produce a 25k area around themselves when a player places a new colony they may place it for self or allied self will make it so only your buildings can go down allied allows fellow corpmates or alliance members into your control zone should multiple players build within the same area their defences can work togetherif the player placed the colony for self then only his control area is covered by his planetary shields however should he place the colony as allied his generators will support the area covered by any control zone of a corpalliance member on the planet and conversely theres will cover his area colonies in high sec have the option to be placed as coshare and indeed all currently established ones will be set to that  in essence they will not project a control zone until changed by their ownersto that end new structures will be needed pi defence networks introduce 4 new structure types defence commands ammo depots planetary batteries and shield batteries while you do not need to route defences they must still be linkeddefence commands these structures control and regulate planetary shields each structure increases the recharge rate of the colonies shieldsammo depots these structures create and distribute terrestrial ammunitions from basic elements found on any planet type the more of these structures you have the faster your planetary batteries ammo supplies will refill due to the nature of terrestrial munitions they have no use in space and hence most colonies dont even bother exporting them even to other planetsplanetary battery these are more or less turrets based on platforms that use terrestrial ammunitions produced by ammo depots like there space bearing counterparts there are 4 types of batteries and 4 sizes each battery starts out small and is upgraded bigger unlike pi materials you do not need to route ammo to a planetary battery as this is automatic when first created a planetary battery starts to receive ammunition until its stores are full as long as an ammo depot that the player controls exists the best way to think of it is like a ships capacitor as the planetary battery fires it uses up its stores of munitions until depleted or the target is destroyed having more ammo depots increases ammo production so it is possible to make enough ammo to sustain weapons fire indefinitely planetary shields  each structure increases the total hp of the shield barrier that covers your control range and if an allied colony that of your allies while under the protection of a shield all colony structures are none targetable colony combatwhen you want to engage in combat with a planets colonies you must warp to planetary bombardment range this is more or less the only instance eve will ever have but not really as anyone can enter it when you warp to bombardment range you load into a closer up view of the planet one in which you can fly around completely but your never more than 300k from the planets surface when this is happening people in the normal eve view will see combat effects played around the planet but there are no targetable ships they can however warp to bombardment range as well and attempt to save their coloniesonce a hostile fleet is within bombardment range they will see all the structures on the planet as well as a bubble around any shielded ones shooting it will eventually break the shields at this time the hostiles may target and destroy any structures they chose
dev posts in the forums need to be more accessible either in the eve insider tab or as news items valid news worth posts should not have to found and posted in dev blogs or player blogs because a lot get missed or get posted weeks after the fact one salution would be to flag dev posts and allow players to jump directly to them in the forums instead of searching 30 pages of textor they could be forwarded for screening as news items to the character login pageeither method would go along way to show that developers are communicating with players on a daily basis
1 for adding a jump to next dev post button in all threads most of the time it would be just convenient to have but in the big threadnaughts such a feature is a must
it would make it a lot easier to find they could post in announcements or make a new forum
dev posts in the forums need to be more accessible either in the eve insider tab or as news items
valid points but it requires digging thru the tabs to find them the first thumbs up says it best finding the best response in all the pages of text needs to be made simpler or new people to the game will take one look at the first page of the forum see no ccp response assume there never is one and come back months later like i did when they have the time to read pages and pages of text and figure out how this forum workhaving the posts grouped by author is nice but has no contexteven a flag saying ccp has posted on this issue would be better then nothing at alla blog focused only on dev posts is the only way to do the posts justice best example blues posts make up most news items on mmochampioncomeven if this is used only as a guide to use the forums this thread does its job
my post count just went down by 50 wtf you guys
none of those cons have come supported by reasoned argument the notion that learning skills add any kind of real depth to eve was seen as absurd by most posters it would be accurate to say there is a significant minority opposed to changing the learning skills but theyve yet to come up with much in defense of that position however i welcome csms or better yet ccp staff to read that assembly thread and see for themselves the arguments for and against the removal of learning skills
that looks about right yesthen you get however many sp you have in the learning skill tree to use on other skills
plus whatever extra sp you earned by having higher attributes compared to a peer that didnt train them so its not like you lose anything in the process
all of them have theyve been handwaved away with nuh unhhh like you just did but that doesnt change their support the fact is that the pro arguments not only lack support the fact that they lack support is noted claiming something that you dont know is true as a pro point and then saying oh yeah and we need some facts to prove that this even exists is odd as for simplifying skill planning by removing variables seriously in eve we can also simplify training by cutting three races out of the game or maybe just take away the longshort weapon dynamic and give each race one generic weapon after all its confusing having to choose which to put sps into and when to say nothing of how much time it takes to specialize in multiple weapon systems and as we all know complexity specialization and morechoicesthantime are all totally against the core nature of eve eh eh removing complexity and choice that leads to varying development paths is a pro in eve since when and of course the cons section does not include the very real fact that removing learning skills removes depth and choice as well as the tradeoff between short and long term profit its a solution in search of a problem and hopefully ccp ignores that specific proposal
not our fault that people didnt train these skills we learnt about them did the math and worked it it would be better to train them so we did others maybe new about them but put it off and didnt train now in relity the person who didnt train the learning skills now are better off or gunna be because they spent all sp on other skills and are gunna get betterequal attributes to the ones that did train them so they infact lost no time and gain quite abit of timenow the ones that did train em sure we gained time from training them but thats because we put the few months into training them to get sometyhing out of it now that specail reward of training the skills will be taken away from us depending how they change it and they are taking a big choice out of the game which is to train or not to train so basicly we loose that 12 months of training  specail prize we get for training them as in shorter time for skills so yes we are at a loss and i demand my sp put into other stuff if they change it
what utter rubbish maybe you need to reread that thread how is removing learning skills and replacing the lost stats or at least most of them not a huge boost to new players pursuit of their first career path in eveno one can accurately empirically prove something like the causes of new player retention or departure from eve that said theres a great abundance of anecdotal evidence that it is the case but obviously that alone doesnt prove the point still we can logically surmise that a great many players would be put off playing eve because they essentially are pushed into not playing for the first few months of their subscription dont deny thats the case theres even video footage of a ccp employee saying he played counter strike for the first few months of eve while he trained these skills and said words to the effect that it was terrible game design this ed argument has been slammed over and over again theres little choice involved in learning skills saying there is a choice is like saying we have a choice to either fly in a plane or swim from new york to london sure theres a choice of a kind but when everyone chooses the one choice its no longer a choice of any meaning learning skills are rather simple actually complexity is neither their problem nor an attribute of learning skills i dont think ill respond to the rest of your nonsense in the quote as anyone with half a brain knows it has no relevance to removing learning skills learning skills add depth this is a very real fact is it how so there maybe a choice in whether you take them to 5 but other than that what is this depth you speak of maybe you mean depth in terms of game time it adds more time sink thats the only depth i seehate to break it to you well actually i kind of enjoy telling you but ccp already agrees with those of us that think learning skills should be removed its only their sluggish pace at fixing long standing issues and fear of the rage of lamers like you that has prevented learning skills being dumped long agoto the csms presenting this to ccplet ccp know theyre going to get anger either way so just do what they think is right for the game it annoys me far more that they would cave into players like finnagain and his ilk based on fear of their negative reaction than the actual prospect of learning skills remaining the later just means i wont encourage friends and family to play eve not that any likely would in its current form the former tells me that game is pretty much doomed due to developer attitude and i should consider canceling
ahhh the argument by nuhn unnnhhconvincingother things that would boost new playersgive new players racial titan v and their own titan give them several replacement titans if they lose those too its essential for eve that some players not have an advantage over others if its the result of their investment of resources that earns them that bonusgive new players all 800 billion isk if they spend it give them more in increments of 100 billion after all there is really no choice between making isk and doing other things since everybody makes isk to some degree or another and so its not a choice at all free isk for all new playersmake them all jedis or has that been done beforeof course ill deny that thats the case as its stupid how long does it take to train warp disruptors and abs hint not longbonus points for but a dev did something so that proves that nobody can play the game without waiting for months i think you mean that tards have flailed at it again and again while actually doing nothing to debunk itis there choice involved yesdo the choices allowed balance long and short term rewards and expenses yesis there anything youve said which rebuts that nousing your same logic we also must do something about having tacklers in fleets since all fleets have them if they dont want their enemies to warp off and dps since all fleets have dps if they want to shoot folks and mining lasersdrones since all miners have them and isk since all traders use that andand train analogies to at least lvl ii unless thats too hard if so just get ccp to give you that skill swimming the atlantic is a physical impossibility but training skills without sps in lss is not at all itd be a choice between say spending 100 on a train between new york and la versus spending 1000 on a commercial jet airliner between new york and laand then some muppets demanding that everybody be given free airfare since after all there must be no choice at all involved since almost nobody takes amtrak these days ahhh the argument by excessive punctuation also a classicyes learning skills add depth to a characters profile as the degree they are taken to govern how quickly sps are gained just like implants but there is less rage over 4s and gasp you even need to train a skill to be able to use 4s as opposed to 3s why thats no choice at all right ehor maybe all new players should be given cybernetics v and over 9000 5 implants for each stat i mean thatd probably help new player retention rightif there are learning skills in the game which are totally optional and completely unnecessary to having an enjoyable and rewarding time playing eve youll still refrain from encouraging family and friends from playing eve a game that youve been playing for nearly half a decade during which time learning skills have existed for 100 of the time and which havent stopped you from playing the game year after year after year after yearkind of a do what i say not what i do kind of a tackbecause we all know that the quality of eve is determined by how fast you can amass spsbut itd totally be much cooler if every new player could start as a jedi how could that go wrong
rather than wasting my time responding to all that trash ill simply ask you a question or twoif learning skills are so great for eve and should be kept why not add learning skills for learning skills lets call these new skills childhood development they would be a series of skills ccp adds to the game that takes 6 months to fully train both prerequisites for basic learning skill and that without which all other training time is doubledit would add depth and choice to eve wouldnt itthe new child development skills wouldnt really be necessary skills to train surelynot having child development skills might mean ccp is about to give cybernetics and titan v to new players rightjedis will be introduced into the game was this your attempt at digging up dirt on me for some lame ad hominem attack to add to the rest of your nonsense arent you sneaky unfortunately you forget that a players character creation date or first post does not mean theyve been playing all that time
ahhh the argument by sure you showed that every single point i made was full of crap but nuhn unnnnhhhhighly cogent learn about eve yes there are learning skills that effect other learning skills memory and intelligence effect the tier 1 skills tier 2 have other skills and learning effects them all interesting fallacy youre falling back on now though if there is a good level of depth and choice involved why we must need to add even more of course it wouldnt necessarily be a bad thing but your example of skills that only effect learning is ed as all learning skills effect the totality of sp acquisition pretending that something new not being added is the same as a longstanding game feature being removed for absolutely no good reason is part for the course for your argumentspeaking of the rationalizations that you are using in the place of actual reasoning you seem to have accidentally forgotten each and every single one and coincidentally tried to handwave away the refutations once your rationalizations were shown to be total bull that was pretty lucky yet another bit of fail eh please learn the definition of ad hominem it doesnt in fact mean pointing out that youre full of crap and engaging in blatant hypocrisy and that you dont even believe your own nonsense about how people shouldnt play the game due to learning skills which lets face it is a total tard claim even if you werent trolling anyways of course your evasion is even lamer then the claim that showing you were trolling is an ad hominem whether or not you played continually is hardly relevant to the fact that after nearly half a decade you are still playing eve despite your bluster about how horrible eve is due to having the option to increase your rate of acquiring skillpoints and how people shouldnt play eve
having skills just for the sake of skills is stupid and poses an unnecessary barrier for new playersi hated doing them on my main and did so for all of my alts yes they are a choice but not a very voluntary one if you want to be able to compete so i will vote for whatever measure is taken to remove them or diminish their influence
theyre not skills for the sake of skills theyre skills for the sake of time time is the only real resource thats inelastic in eve with time you make isk complete missions kill sov structures whatever but the amount of time in a day cannot be modified learning skills are essentially no different than implants should those be removed from the game toonor does the objection about extra time for noobs hold water no matter how fast skills train with a boosted attributes fix it will still take a significant amount of time for new players to say fly fully t2 fit battleships and those who can afford implants will have an advantage over those who cannot and those who can afford better implantstheres no barrier to playing if youre new to the game and want to get into a profession immediately then train for that if you want to keep your spshour as high as possible then train for learning its 100 volitional and not a necessity at all you can have exactly as many skills as a player with maxed learning skills it just takes a bit longer in point of fact it takes years until a full investment in learning skills sees the time invested rewarded by time savings there is no actual barrier just a perceptual one i started the game and barely trained any skills found a lowsec corp got into 00 pvp participated in an alliance that built and lost an outpost all without putting more than a few 10s of thousands of points into the learning group
it appear that you have forgotten something in your proposali can suppose you mean one or more of the 00 suggestions probably the one abut jump in point that will make defending 00 sovereign space almost impossiblebut you stated specifically that it is for 00 only and beside that a newbie with a frigate will be one vollied by a sensor boosted bs with guns especially a minmatar one as they use to say been there got that in the time your newbye frigate get in warp the pirate bs at the gate so 150 km from him would have him locked and destroyed so you are already rick and simply want to deny new player the possibility to make isk you really want to push the new players in a situation where they will need to do level 1 missions or to go to low sec to get a combat worthy ship and the skillbooks but at the same time you want to keep aUFFFDUFFFD you already have so you can keep a huge advantagepftt
guess you didnt read it then although i might have confused a skim reader by putting it in the null sec section bolded and underlined for your benefitin regard to the sniper example you gave a frigate should be able to warp out before a bs even sensor boosted one can lock and shoot it however if im wrong and thats an issue make it 1500km the point is to get fights off gates particularly where you jump into a system as it stands most pvp in eve occurs at or near gates which frankly is pretty tyas to it making it harder to defend null sec sov space good null sec needs a shake up and denying nap crazy zergers the use of zone camping with their big blobs can only be a good thing i specifically want to attract pirates and other current low sec pvpers to go into null sec and cause a ruckus rather than have them all bottled up in a handful of low sec entry points making empire space dweller falsely believe all of low sec is like stepping into a john carpenter moviemy goal is definitely not to deny a new player isk it is in part to deny older players the means to separate their isk generation from pvp i would be very happy to see a fresh server but theres no way thats happening most of what we propose on these forums is unlikely to happen as it is im also certainly not trying to horde wealth of my own i only have about 80 mil isk in my wallet atm which is a pitiful amount
so1 you dont have read my comment 2 apparently you routinely put suggestions under the wrong heading as you consider an obvious fact that something under 00 is meant for low sec so dear xorv what of the other suggestions under 00 are meant for low sec evidently you have forgotten how slow a new player with a low skill in evasive maneuvering can be independently from you goal that would be the result of your proposal old players will keep the ships and isk made before the change and use them to make more new players will not have a way to gather enough isk to get on equal footing without selling plex ie resorting to out of game resources to be capable of playing even if you have a goal you should consider what will be the consequences of the method you propose to get there apparently you dont have considered them
venkul im sorry the way of presented my ideas caused you so much confusion i wanted to separate the ideas for high low and null security space but yes there was some cross overs however every one was stated as such basically it was just the gate idea and the faction standing changes to docking and being shot at by npcs that applied outside of the category i placed them in i have considered the consequences and came to different conclusions than you did older players and corps that have been able to milk eve through t2 bpos and stuff like that will always have an advantage over new players regardless of whether changes like i suggested are implemented or notyou seem to be under the impression that isk generation would come an abrupt halt with my suggestions mission running for instance is doable as it is in low sec and my proposals would make it easier its just that presently in terms of riskeffort vs reward high sec mission running is much more appealing albeit also far more boring
sigh so where is the suggestion to make scanning ships in mission impossible a noob player trying to do mission in low sec will lose so many ships that he will quityour thought processing is that of an old players that know how to mitigate the risk not that doing missions in low sec will ever be interesting with the current scanning system but a old player can mitigate the risk you are asking a new player that hardly know how the overview work and that will have a hard time to survive a level 2 mission in a cruiser to use a directional scanner to detect the probes keep an eye on local for possible pirates and at the same time manage the npc and to top that with little isk to replace the ships he will constantly loosestop trying to balance the game only for old players and think what your proposal will do to new playersand no i wasnt particularly confused by your proposal i was pointing out how badly you had done itif something is meant for low sec or lower it should be placed under low sec and possibly it should be marked as low sec and lower the strength of a proposal depend on the presentation not only on the basic ideaand i stay my opinion to work your proposal require to restart eve as it is it will widen the gap between new and old players by a too wide margin
the guy above me has a good idea id like to add a few of my own for lowsec and beyondadd agents to concord with missions related to player requested security operations let players run missions for concordadd more drugs drug related sites etc ffs there should be drugs to boost just about anything rather than the limited amount we have right now increase the number of drug slots per playeradd bribery as a possibility to the factions in any possible lowsec area say youd like a station built in a lowsec system that currently dead and empty offer the faction that controls the lowsec system 5 bil to build one thereor turn off the gate guns for 5 mins or anything along those lines that would improve the happening factor of lowsec right now it aint happening
this is awesome
yes it is
thats just a terribly asinine statement the csm delegates arent devs they arent employed by ccp they most likely dont even have access to the codes that are affecting the lag and if they did they wouldnt know what to do with it did you mean how about you just tell ccp to fix the lag or are you just ing at them over anything you can get your hands on because its the in thing to do
i cant say it was a smooth ride in csm 2 with pattern and the pos exploit but i really must commend csm 5 on their dedication and efficacy in this term kudos guys and keep up the good workas to whether eve is dead i dont think eve will ever die  some peoples lives are tied up in it however this might be worse than the t2o event and only time will reveal the truth about thatlike the current csm i love this game and dont want to see it die if you guys need anything i can be of help with just let me know
i have an idea instead of making one single insurance company make many that charge different amounts and insure different types of attacks say a pirate insurance would insure you if you suicide gank someone but is more expensive because theyre on the run from concord and need more to fight them off or a mining company that only protects mining barges and exhumers that sounds like a good comprimise
if ccp took the time to achieve excellence and fix flaws in their shiny new content i would be more than happy to wait longer for shiny new features while im content to play with with the more polished less flawed features previously implemented
i have 17 months to spare  can i help 
as a lead software engineer i have to echo these observations
great suggestions would certainly make searching for courier contracts far more userfriendly
this is hardly a worthy idea of diverting development resources to it when there are a vast amount of other thing that are more worthy of attentionnot supported
do you come to these forums just to troll honestly every post of yours i have read seems to be there specifically to annoy or anger people typed completely in boldtrue there are more important issues to deal with but thats no reason to not support a relevant and rather good idea this isnt a forum specifically for issues of only the highest priority
personally i like the learning skills your suggestion is simply remove them and make skills train fasteri find that the learning skills are a bit of a tactical choice and i agree with whoever said that learning skills are a part of character specialization sorry i do not support this idea
learning skills should go away but i propose a slightly different implementation its intended to be fair to players while changing as little of the existing system as possible the resulting attributes are identical to what you can get in the present system with fullytrained learning skills and you wont need to grant a free remap either implant effects remain unchangedessentially the idea is to remove all the learning skills boost the base attributes and keep the 11x multiplier effect but not as a skill here it is in detail1 record the number of skill points each character has trained in the learning category also record the cost of those skill books2 remove the learning 2 per level skill21 instead the 11x multiplier effect is retained for all characters as though they have the skill at level 53 characters that have never remapped simply have 10 added to each base attribute4 characters that have remapped attributes have their base attributes set to old base  respective skills not including the 11x multiplier and then41 characters who still do not have the full complement of 89 base attribute points have the balance added to their highest attributes in accordance with the new remap limits while you have points to add  add 1 to the highest base attribute below 25  5 remove the remaining learning skills6 refund skill points and isk to characters based on 1advantages no change to ultimate attribute levels no change to implant effects no change to net training speed  characters investment in learning skills is rewarded proportionally no free remap neededdisadvantages remapping feature must be modified to accommodate the new range of base attributes new code may be needed to make the 11x attribute multiplier universal some changes needed to character creation and npe
love this idea
as long as there is an option to enable or disable them i fully support this wonderful idea
more comments pls
now i can finally test ships without the endless grinding just to fly an intercepter by the time i get a sisi update and train for it i get mirrored5 mil sounds reasonable but i probably will be one of those peeps with a chimera for lolz 
100 support this would be a great way to test content that players otherwise dont have the skills for
hate training cap ships over and over again whenever ccp decides to update the mirrors signed
programming time spent on something thats for sisi only no thanks that time would be better spent on something that would actually be useful to tq
programming are you madthey already have the system in place do you recall the free 100000sp you got because of the long downtime well all they need to do is add 5 million onto your sisi account when it mirrors i highly doubt it would require anything apart from something like reward all  5000000sp 5mil sp isnt even that much especially if youre afraid of all those cap ships that might spring up because 5 mil will get you all the support skills to actually be usefulsupported to the end its the least ccp can do to encourage people onto sisi

yar
afaik as long as its virtual currency there is no legal issue except in the most ed countries that probably wouldnt allow the game anyway
sure why not it is a virtual currency in a game after all no legal troublemight aswell add liers dice monopoly joker 5finger filia ouch chess checkers and a civilization 3 like game while your at it
if youre reading thisget out of my canthe potential for hilarious creative use far beyond my feeble abilities is simply astoundinghowever i feel it is unnecessary dunno im sort of on the fence about this oneyeah decided why not
bookmarks are widely used for this already but i think they induce quite a bit of lag supportedalso if the notes were electronically signed you could setup some kind of tradeable contract enabling stuff like iousalso the rp community could greatly benefit from this enabling them to write reports and books
sure seems usefull
yep
right now doing a mining operation is simply unprofitable with the way hostile can hump in system and warp to your belt and instakill you on the spotindustrial mining ships and haulers need to have better agility when dealing with hostiles to fix this i propose that for each nonblue in your system the mining barge and haulers get a 5 to agility to help it get out before the hostiles warp in on you this would have stacking penalties and only work in low sec and 00
no 010
what does no010 mean
it means they consider you a troll and a bad one gave your troll a rating 0 of 10i have to agree with their assessmentdont troll assembly hall
oh so because someone doesnt like my proposal it gives them the right to call me a troll  you he is the troll coming in my thread and trying to derail it
no because your two proposals are so freaking ed unbalanced and embodiment of the stereotype of the whiny carebear that we think youre trolling usso either youre ed or youre trying to get a rise out of us consider it a compliment that we choose to consider you the laterbetter to be thought a troll instead of an idiot then to open your mouth and remove all doubt and prove youre an idiot
bad idea bad thread bad poster
supported would make ships cheaper and more affordable for lose in pvp market would even out it makes little gain for miners in the long run dont care for barge kills cant risk putting too many of them in kb anyway those are a liabilityright next to rookie ship kills if you ever want to apply to top corpsalliances with the toon record stays with you forever for the pirate alts with no future plans oh well their problem i just want cheaper stuff
you are either a really bad troll or really too new to this game to be even trying to make balancing suggestions
what kind of balance is there between pvp fit and barge exactly who cares its not like there are any barges to kill in lowsec anyway if you like killing them go to highsec and gank some ice miner
dude its freaking simple setup a mining plan thats designed to keep mining efficiency and mining safety balanced dont expect ccp to help you out on this one as a 00 miner i have yet to lose a single exhumer or industrial to anyone as i was a careful carebear besides its your freaking fault if you get jumped in 00 and you didnt have a plan in place
in some of those backwater sovnull systems tucked deep inside the blue alliance ss you dont see a single red for weeks on end its safer than highsec where random ppl gank you
cromo your epic failure continues to amaze mealso when it comes to mining exhummer  ishtar when it comes to combat ishtar  exhummer welcome to a game were every ship is differnet and built for different things if you cant deal with the fact that some ships just cant certian things please go you wont be missed can i haz ur stuffs and fyi i have seen battlehulks one took down several pvp ships attemping to kill it look it up on youtube if you dont beleive me
right now this game revolves around super carriers they are everywhere and unless you have some epic fleet on standby they can just hot drop left and right without any consequenceswhat i propose is remove their ability to fit electronic warfare modules specifically warp disruption and webification modules that way they need a support fleet to tackle stuff like the way it is meant to bethere is far too much hot dropping lone freighters and other small capitals happening because those super carrier pilots are just looking for risk free pvpgive this proposal support and help balance this ed game mechanic
i dont think supercarriers are your biggest problem
stop posting in all boldbut requiring a tackler will only make it so you need two characters i agree motherships no not supercarriers need to be rebalanced but this isnt it
or you could just be smart about how you travel in a freighterwb emo tj
well this obviously youre a massive idiot  is more applicable but its censored if youre travelling in a solo freighter in low or null sec you deserve to be mom hotdropped tbh
risk free pvp lol are you serioushow is dropping 20b isk on random people you know little about risk free for all they know you could have a cyno and 20 moms on standby just waiting for themdont fly freighters alone in lownull sec and you will be fine dont fly and capital alone in lownull sec either its just stupid
awwwwittle nooblet is crying over losing his freatarpoor widdle noobletpleasegrow up
i never said they were totally alone even with an escort they are still easy targets for super carriers what good is an escort if they are taking 12500 dps from just one supper carrierstop try to say i am mad because i lost a freighter or i am emo tj you are just players with no skill that think by attempting to make me look bad it will somehow make you look goodstick to the balancing issue and stop trying derail my thread
i lold also stop typing in bold youre making me cry
well start treating you with seriousness when you stop acting like a 6 year old crying over a kicked over sand castle who screams in bold typed lettersyou should feel honored to feel the wrath of a super carrierthey arent cheapand the pilots who use them are trapped in them againgrow upget a backbone this is eve onlinenot kiddie online
im fairly certain an illiterate child could offer better balancing advice than you
why couldnt the super drop on me i wanted to see one up close
ive never seen cromo post a nontroll or a not in bold post so just ignore his posts he has very poor resoning skills form what ive seenone question why would someone bring a lone freighter to low sec its equally as suicidal as warping to high sec in an orca with 10 sec status stop whining that they are powerful thats what you get when you have a 20 billion isk ship full of very expensive frightersbombers they are supposed to be powerful besides the titan the the biggest and most expensive ships in the game if you dont like people with more moneyskill points then you being better than you hello kitty online is  that way when you emoragequit from being less richnot flying as big ships as a 5 year old char and it stays that way becuase thats how the game has been since luanch date can i haz ur stuffs
hell yes it would not be very difficult to include a name change history much like you have in the way of a corp history and really if someone wanted to beware of a scammer pirate etc etc all they would have to do is get off their lazy bums and make a few clicksas it is many new people come into this game not knowing what to expect and just choose a name as they are unsure what to go with whilst also wanting to experience the game from there as time progresses they wish to stick to their character given they do not want to do all the isk gatheringskill training again
i agree sucks when youve named a character then decide you hate his name or something but its far too late to do anything about it i also agree it should be very limited if players are allowed to do it more than once at all
absolutely fully supported no reason someone who doesnt pay to play the game should be paid ingame
agreed
no
highsec should be left as it but i see it as being useful for lowsec have to point out though that the button when it pops up cant force you to act on it like some of the other ones do try starting a petition while doing something else otherwise it will hamper your efforts to defend yourself
eve looks great when you can see it im sure it has been brought up before but why isnt there a command chat window that filters your other channels into iteg you have windows intel corp fleet open in the usual tabs you can minimize all those windows and have command chat open and by setting your active channels to different colors all 3 or however many you want filter into your command window intel spike in localcorp reds next door jump in fleetand to talk by using corp intel commands would love to be able to see more than 14 of my screen and so sick of the delay with changing tabs in lag
could be nice and also very confusing then again the point of eve is to have all the graphics covered up by ui
i agree multiplexing chat into one window by different colour text would often be better than the tab nightmare we currently have unfortunately eve already reserves coloured text for chat from special characters gms ccp etc
i think the idea is good as for the color issue why not make it post it like abovelike that it mentions the first 58 letters of the channel in brackets and than shows the textdefinatly supporting the idea
that would not matter via the command box you get your color pallet choices of 20 colors or whatever they are so gms might be yellow right now but you can change intel to yellow and gms to dark red people can leave everything as is or change each option to something different up to them
yep color would be optional but basically you would seeintel spike in localcorp reds next door jump in fleetexcept to make things super easy you might have intel set to red or something so that it stands out against corpalliance chat in white or green or whatever if i knew how to post in color would be handy 
i tentatively support the training of at most 2 characters per account at a time for an additional fee of 7090 of current accounts monthly costs to be paid as other methods are your example imo of 33 to 66 is too cheap and would likely be very lucrative and appealing to many character farmers if you are on a renewing sub you must choose 2 char training account and pay monthly every 3 months 6 months or 12 months in advance as you do now if you choose plexes you must use the needed percentage of a plex if it is chosen to be 70 then ccp allows you to use 70 of a plex leaving the 30 to be combined with other 30 plexes to make a complete plex or says you must use it all and lose the 30 due to your payment method due to the nature of this i think partial plexes should not be allowed to go on the market and perhaps not even contracted some are horrid at math andor wont understand what a partial plex is all assuming ccp can have a partial plex show up as the correct percentage ingame so people arent easily fooled into thinking that they are full plexesid like to be able to skill up some alts and not have my main sucking mothballs during that time but running another account to do so then paying to transfer that char back when it has had enough isnt really what id prefer to do
i support this only if increased subscription cost is involved as the op saysedit lolsupportbutton
ccp regrets their decision to allow creation of more than one character per account as it isto add to this i think the main reason people make multiple accounts is to use them at the same time for example while one mines and jetcans the other could haul ore from the can to the stationthe whole point of only being able to train one character is to force you to specialize sorry but i agree with the system currently in place
considering how much money theyre making off character transfers i doubt it
fixt for youlol theres absolutely no way at this point
make that 15 per month and you might have a deal
as many of you are aware empire is very full the problem is that whiel the new sov mechainics allow for smaller alliances to hold and upgrade sov space the larger established ones hold all the real power weve seen it develop over the years huge alliances stopming everything in their path while with their pets they hold sway over massive amounts of space i have a solution to change that which would use variations on existing mechainics may the server forgive me for the extra load im about to add lolthe need is simple enough you need small and medium sized pockets constellation sized perhaps 5 to 10 systems each that can be sovtagged and upgraded they need to be linked right to empire to get people out of the highsec areas they need to be isolated from each other otherwise youre just adding a new region which will be consumeed by the locusts that make up the huge blocks we already have you also want to be able to have a bit of security if all its going to do is create new camping spots for pirates again not much pointthe proposal itself is this that 8 or 10 new 00 constellations be added to each highsec or lowsec region but not 00 regions they would link to empire through what i like to think of as hidden gates the gates are there but they have to be scanned down the gate wont move once its scanned so you can bookmark it and you may have a group that finds it also and decides to visit on occasion but for the most part to the people passing by youre not even there its a stargate in every normal way except it doesnt show up on your overview the rats can be the same as that region using normal tables for anomalyplex generation as the given npc areas with those rats the ore will be a random mix but again can be upgraded with sov is a home that a 400 or 500 man alliance can defend easily with a single or perhaps double access point close to empire so it doesnt require the massive expendature of logistic resources the larger alliances can afford and it increases combat opportunities aswelljust because the gate has to be scanned down doesnt make it invisible or impossible for everyone else to find you could still have people coming in to your space and you could have a hidden back door if you slack off and dont scan every inch of your space there could be more than one gateany thoughts on this obviosly btw no gate in jita that would just beuh yeah no jita one lol
we dont need more space we just need to spread everything out instead of loads of gd stuff in just certain systems whille rest r empty
what you are referring to is the random distribution of resources which exists through all regions taken as a whole if you look at a single region or even 2 or 3 yes you will see some distortion in the spreads but in a larger picture they even out if youre looking for arkonor in highsec take up scanning because that wont be coming around this proposal is to create a number of smaller areas that with the new sov mechanic can allow smaller groups to have acces to the kinds of resources needed to build up without having them become pets or being bound to the larger alliances as weve seen in the past it also increases pvp areas without using lowsec which nobody really uses that much anyway
sounds like you basically want a private 00 area for a handful of corpsalliances you are just taking whs neutering themno sleepers no random entries and expanding them so they get all the benefits of 00 and the secrecy of wh spaceid like more whs maybe expanding them would be a good idea but what you are proposing sounds too easy for the occupants why would people go into what amounts to private 00 when there are only a couple of entry points from highseclowsec they do it at wh because they wont know where they go if it is occupied or to find sleepers i think if you offered the average highsec player the opportunity to trespass into a 00 owned territory through the front door theyd turn you down once these constellations are made and occupied they will be mapped and i think only an occasional visitor or visitors will enteri can see some promise but thered need to be changes to just making a private fort no one can enter except through the front door where you can upgrade the space etc maybe larger wh pockets but no upgrades or limited new upgrades like guns placed at static entry points
what exactly prevents the existing alliances from taking over this new space
im not sure how you see it as neutered wormhole space any more than existing 00 regions are neutered wormhole space what im proposing is that a couple new 00 regions be broken down into constellations and the gates seeded around empire in a way that requires actual effort to locate them wormhole space is good in several ways but it has a number of limitations which prevent the kind of building up that conventional alliances require to move up the food chain for instance the lack of ability to move capital ships out once built no supercaps at all limitations on logistics enforced by the whs mass and timer really the concept that you have of a private fort is ridiculous as such areas already exist in the form of deadend constellations throughout npc 00 and lowsec space even the access points are for existing 00 are choke systems designed to minimise access and increase security this is meant to produce miniregions that smaller groups can use and secure without having to have the backing of a larger power the relation to wormhole space is miniscule at best if you want more wormholes start a new postas for what prevents existing alliances from moving in all i can say isnothing the game allows for no certainties what i can do is point out the difficulties in them doing so let us assume that morsus mihi had someone locate a gate in mmmm otanoumi now yes they could certainly move in there however would it really gain them anything besides what they arleady have no not really would it involve extra effort on their part yes it would it would also divide their forces in the event of major combat which weve seen in the past even iinstalling a pet in there would have issues they have to be able to defend that pet after all it would be so much simpler for them to get that associate alliance onto the tribute blue list while it would not be impossible for them to do i really cant see them bothering with it
why generate more space for current naptrainsi agree expanding wormholes would be great but this is just stupid
who said anything about a naptrain the whole point is to reduce that to give smaller groups the opportunity to use the resources of 00 without having to join a nap train as examples take a look of some of the areas in 00 right now huge areas controlled by a few powers dictating the naptrains to their guests the best way to remove that is to make smaller areas which would be harder to control overall because they arent connected to each other as a regular region is and again if you want more wormhole content make a new post for it this is not wormholes
i see one major flaw in your theory its titanbridging the big alliances will just do what they did with lowsec they will come in snatch all the valueable moons and dont care for the rest leaving nothing but some gunner and cynoalts in systemthan when getting attacked as usual jump their big capital fleet on random group xy and move on again or let the tower fall kill the tower that comes up after and replace it once more i really dont see a reason why to give the big alliances the ability to pay their sovereign costs even more easier so i cant support this ideaalso from your post i assume that the gates once located stay in position forever as you didnt mention downtime at all this would just end up in bookmark selling like in the early days of eve with 15km gate jumpdistance and make it as any other 00 in a very short time
essentially this and assuming you have considered this and somehow want to interject wait no jump bridges into mah new spaze then all youre really asking for is free jamming in some new region sounds thrilling really it does but its still a hairbrained terrible idea you cant just make a new region with special rules and expect it to spawn some new politik based on its unique design its going to get rolled over d and left to bleed out like everything else unless you adress the mechanics that are causing you to say i want nullsec but i dont want nullsec
i empathise but this is not the way to do itinstead nerf travel so that existing alliance blocs cant just curbstomp anything from anywhere on the map within a day im looking at you jump clones  jump freighters  jump bridge networks  warp to zeroben
neutered wh space no sleepers to deal with no random entriesexits that may come and go meaning you cant always know the way out or even where it leads you the random inout also means people can and will wander in why because people explore wh and want to kill sleepers or setup a pos move in attack you etc making new 00 not connected to old 00 and with a static connection to highseclowsec and not connected to other new 00 with a couple of entries is basically a fort for the inhabitants the ways in are possibly wh if you allow that but they cant connect to 00 right jumpbridges and the static gates you have to probe out to find all this and you want to be able to claim sov and upgrade it cause it is 00 but not quite righti get your goal of 00 where other people can exist but i dont see it happening not with you rewriting the rules to tailor space for you and it still could be taken from you rather i think there need to be real changes to 00 first so that the alliances cant simply own empty space so easily dominion was supposed to fix that but that didnt happen
and this would keep existing powerblocks outhow sounds goodat first but as soon as you look at it in detail it simple doesnt work it would be instasovd by the powerblocks pets and if they dont instasov it they will jsut do what they did in low sec claim every mon actually worth mining and leave the crummy stuff to the rest of us
ah sorry i just skimmed your proposal the first time around stillthere is the principle of the matter to factor in industrial ships are just that industrials they have the capacity to have limited defenses and weapons but otherwise cant compare to a pure combat ship even if its a frigate what youre proposing is to give them combat abilities however limited they are to a ship that is otherwise not designed for itand just an fyi t2 sentries can do a lot of damage enough to easily pop a frigate if their transversal or lack of thereof is just just right think the damage of a heavy drone only it doesnt need to catch up with its targetgoose99 escorts do work you just have to be smart about it in low or null sec you can have a bunch of very menacing ships with fast tackle to keep most attackers at bay if an attack still happens then a logistic ship andor remote repairs from the escorting ships helps tremendouslyin highsec the escort needs to change tactics as its impossible to clear the way in the traditional sense unless both parties are at war with one another instead the use of scouts to see where the gate camps are becomes invaluable
explain to me why do you jump the industrial through before the escort clears the gatecamp
its nice to see some one who actualy responds with logic to a postbut i digress indys are the only ship in the game that is more or less a flying shoot me sign i mean if you compare standard vehicles today are indys are all most bullet proof while are cars and truck bust up pretty well as far as i know very few indys survive an attack even in high sec  however if they had wpods they might be able to push of the attacker and get away
real life cars and trucks are not designed for combat like nonindustrialbased ships are industrials are haulers and are designed for just that hauling they are not meant to fight back and they are not supposed to be heavilydefended there are tech 2 industrials designed to not go boom thats what theyre there for on top of this if ccp were to add a way for industrials to defend themselves why would they add a brand new unneeded mechanic when they could just add a drone bay or high slots and hardpoints this makes very little sense to me and it seems like it would be a waste of resources to implement
iloled hardsomeone is doing it wrong
muahahahaaha killer haulers ftw go in launch 100 wpods muahahahahahaha
not supported using out of game cash is a huge problem that would hurt a very real deterent ccp has to 1 below add your suggestion in and that will become an even bigger problem 1 isk farmers etc will abuse this see above 2 metagamers  laundering characters  another way this will make eves frontier justice system even worse
i love this idea a quick and easy way to transfer a character using an ingame item youll likely already own
they are a waste of time and doesnt add any enjoyment for anyone yes i have over 105 million sp in learning skills spread across my chars and i cant wait to see them removed
i guess the implants that give you more attributes are a waste of time eh lets remove them as wellhell for sake of it why not remove cap skills as well they help alot but i cba to actually train em on second thought remove all skills cause i cba to train em
wow look how dumb your character isimplants i consider ok  theres quite a few people who would disagree but they have an associated cost and active risk of losing them provided you undock so i dont see much of a problem there other skills have associated benefits as well  improvements left and right ability to fit certain modules etc and therefor arent just there for the sake of skills
dont spread this secret around or anything but in eve skills are trained over periods of time the learning grind is spending time training skills in order to save you time training skills its a bizarre circle of tedium which pushes new players into stupid unfun nonsense hey newbie be sure to spend the first two weeks in your ibis not getting better at killing things or flying your ship but on training skills that will grant you a training payback in 6 months if you dont get bored and quit by then at the very time when they should be at their most wideeyed and enthusiastic about this exciting new world theyve entered
 which is why being able to train the exact same skills as anybody else but being able to do it quicker saves time there is no real difference between implants and skills other than the fact that you need implants for each jump clone and theyre a good bit easier to lose since losing skills is generally pretty rare as long as youre not a total tard no it doesnt this is just simple if you do not want to train learning skills at first and want to get into a fast tackling rifter then do that if new players cant figure that out for themselves or if they listen to bad advice well thats part of eve too should we remove exhumers because some new players will be convinced that they have to train right to a hulk the very first thing they do and forget everything else yetagain there is absolutely no reason that a new pilot cannot pretend that learning skills dont exist which is what everybody arguing against them wants anyways and train for whatever they want if learning skills are eliminated players will do the exact same thing they can choose to do now except there will be no choice and it will be mandatory and this because some folks claims that the degree of choice offered right now is really an interdict because there are potential advantages to some choices meh
saves me a lot of logging in and out p
a simple yes
i support this idea but since there is no real alternative offering on the current mmo market ccp can do whatever they think will get them the most  at the end of the day
support doing something to fix rails and blasters
remove the learning skillsthey are a wast of time for new playersi have 3 accounts all 55 at least 3 years old eachget rid of them its a ridiculous waste of time for a new player and adds nothing to the game
not supportedeve is about our choices in the emergent sand box of new eden choosing whether or not to train learning skills is a part of the essence of eve the need to choose between long term gain and short term gratification is what separates eve players from the rest taking away learning skills is to a degree like taking away all the gunnery or spaceship command skills those skills also stand in the way of new players delaying gratification at a critical point in their introduction to the game why not just remove those and make isk the only barrier to piloting every ship in the game perfectlybecause then it wouldnt be eve and we wouldnt be playing it
10
not supportedrelatively new player who thinks this idea sucks why take the choice awayi hope this doesnt make it to the list of demands like that crap pi omnibus
they are effectively 10 implants you never lose if you choose to buy the skill books and train them meaning you can get that  to attributes with significantly less cost isk wise than you could buying 5s and never have to worry about replacing them if you get podded i support this idea as id rather not spend time training them to get the effect when we can simply give that effect to everyone leveling the playing field allowing new players to benefit from them without having to rack up the millions for the advanced soct or deal with issues of should i train themi cant play for a month bs for those that put the timeisk into learning skills letting them reap the benefit of accelerated sp training is also great it would be nice if that mental exercise balancing training learning with doing what is fun didnt have to go as it is very eve imo but i like the ops solution if learning skills are to go

i like what marcus gideon said so hows about we get a quick option through the command center which is otherwise a completely useless objectreset extractors 5 minute cycle 15 minute cycle 30 minute cycle 1 hour cyclethis is a great idea since i have 5 planets with about 20 extractors per resetting around 100 extractors takes up too much timeand my poor wrist hurts those who caution about the altswell there are alts out there that are strictly for mining ive seen them one person with a few extra cheap comps or lappys and they have a whole mining fleet of alts its already been done so why whine about it

to answer your concern about the legality of the destruction of plexes i will use your comparison to gift cards that you have been usingretailers have no legal obligation to make their gift cards indestructible and whether or not they have an obligation to assist customers in recovering their gift card codes or not is questionable so a proud owner of a gift card that burns up in flames might find himself in the same position of that of a customer whose plex just got destroyedsol

think there should be a landing area around lowsec gates so you cannot get killed landing on a gate at zero in low sec if your moving loot or something small in and around lowsec its hard enough to do without pirates using what i think is a exploit bubbles off gates in 00 i understand but you dont even have a chance to jump out with smartbombs on gates
warp to a planet with a steaper angle towards the outgate and you shoud be able to avoid the smarty

the ability to call concord in lowsec would completely negate lowsec space and turn eve into a highsecnullsec game with no middle ground it does not matter if it is a 30 second delay or a 5 minute delayminers could pre load belts with concord ships that are not affected by the delay missioners and plex runners can do the same as welllowsec would also become a safehaven for super caps as you would need a very very hard core fleet to drop a supercap that can call in concord after a few minutes the loss to the agressors would be billions this would basically negate cap ship usage in lowsecthis would completely negate lowsec gate camping especially for placeslike rancor and helg the first hauler that gets attacked hits the distress button and the gate camp for the day is basically done and over with same can be applied for station campinggames as wellhorrible idea top to bottomyou are doing it wrong  just gotta know where to look and what to do
in high sec by time you think about pressing the button its already to late in some circumstances i would however like to be given the option like a button that would tell concord to back off so i can take care of the issue myself pressing it would immediately stop the concord response and leave all aggro rules in place
no to both suggestions requiring distress call is silly and concord doesnt belong in lowsec if you want to keep people from afking the game than give them something to do instead of wait for their mining lasers to cycle or the rats to die
bastard stole me idea pwhile i can see this easily being done with factories silos and launchpads where each upgrade level has the same cost as individual units with no reduction in power cpu usage multiple in multiple out plus upgraded links for the extra loadhowever i dont think you can do it quite as easily with extractorsyou wouldnt want multiple extractors all on top of each other extracting the same resourceextractors would need to use the grouping proposal either assigning them to groups or selecting multiple extractors for a scan
like that
interesting idea however not as detail as it shouldatm chats have a full player list alliance corp local etcif you put all of the tabs in a single colum and have different namescolours before the message as said above how would you be able to see who is in alliance corp and local
why would you need to if you need to see whos actuall in each channel go look at the channel the idea here is to present relevant information in one place a list of all the users in a particular channel isnt necessary
the combined channel would simply have no member list but clickable names
i think the op said this but this would just be a new window not replacing all your old chat windows youd still have those too
ccp needs to clarify if agro extension is a working as intented game mechanic or if it is an exploit recent posts in cp the eve blogsphere petitions and disccussions have shown that this a big grey area that needs to be resolvedagro extension has long been a tool by highsec mission greifers to extend agression beyond the 15 minute timer there are various ways that this can be done but the most common is shooting a wreck the act of the person shooting the wreck resets the timer of the other person as well as his own even though the other pilot has not taken any aggressive actions against the person for the 15 minutes of the timersenior gms have reimbursed the pilot that knowingly undocked with an active agression timer but figured that it was more then 15 minutes so he was safe then got blown up there needs to be a clear explination of the rules of engagement from ccp regarding this it is either a valid game mechanic and no ships should be reimbursed or it is a n exploit and all ships should be reimbursed if petitioned and the person using the exploit be warnedbanned as a result of his actionsthis is a staple of highsec game play and it needs to be clarified one way or the other
even the gm who reimbursed the missioner said that aggro mechanics are working as intended and the missioner admitted to seeing the aggro timer resethowever had his session not changed in the process he would not see the timer reset fixing invisible aggression timers isnt very hard and ccp needs to do that for wreck shooting lowsec station guns etc
i lost a perfectly good abandon to an ninja salvager after waiting 30 minutesthats without a timer displayed mind youno warning window nothing and i had one before i finished waiting the time out to make surewas toldimplied that there was a glitch and there was nothing to be done or saidso yes its time they got off their ass and fixed it but that wont happen for 18 monthsi curse the invisible aggression timer i dont mind losing the ship as i knew what i was getting into but now i have no freaking way of knowing if im still flagged or not so if you cant trust the server then what do you do about it
well i have been offered a hel for a sensible price and although i can fly one i am discouraged by the obvious price difference in fitting one upan armour tanked sc can be fitted with centumcorpumcorelum a type energised plating which are pretty reasonably priced and drop well same with the idividual x type resists yet there seems to be absolutely no deadspace invulnerability field so although we have gistpith x type shield hardeners  which dont seem to drop anywhere near as the aforementioned armour hardeners check contracts for verification we have no invulnerability field so it is either a dread guristas one or go for an officer and the price difference is astounding 20 billion for an estamels invuln anyoneso my suggestion is simple let us have deadspace invulns pithgist a types maybe  that drop at the same regularity as the armour variations as well as slightly increasing drop rates on the pithgist x type harderners to bring them into parity with armour mod drops

saucei have 2 sometimes 3 accounts and i only use 2 at the same time occasionally and of course never all 3 the reason people make multiple accounts is to train different characters for different thingsand yet people already circumvent that forcing by making multiple accounts
my apologiesi have no sauce if you dont want to take my word for it disregard that part of my post i read it once but i have no recollection of where perhaps i should have worded that more clearly sorry i meant to say that it was to force each character to specialize though looking back i honestly believe i came off as a complete idiot considering the fact that whether its multiple accounts or multiple characters per account each character will still be specialized should i pull out of this thread now and save myself the embarrassment
it is a real shame ank was removed she was the only one that stood up to ccp and was representing the player base i guess they didnt like that and kicked her now we are left with a farce of a csm nothing but yes men who are only there for personal gain

how about having a single skill learning with this each level of learning will grant you 5 points you can allocate to your attributes meaning that in total you can have 25 point for remap each yeari am sure the numbers can be figured out but to me it seems to be the most easily executable and woudl update the system more to be in line of the remap functions
bitter old vets like you and i understand this finn but noobs do not and they also typically do not understand the tradeoffs involved  all they see is wtf ive got to train these skills in order to not waste time training the rest of the skillsccp has stated during a previous csm that they would like to dump learning skills but were unsure of how to do so they want to do it because it hinders noob retention keep in mind that the typical noob quits playing eve we are all nontypical noobsthe recent addition of the skillpoints bonus code gives them a clear way to implement something it wasnt something they just whipped together during the summit to address the long downtime theyd already programmed itthis makes it pretty obvious to me that they will do something about learning skills at some point therefore i felt it was important to get a proposal on the table that ensured that current players who were patient and longterm focused and trained the skills didnt get screwed thats why i raised the issue with csm
raw logs available from the wiki or via the csm databasesummary versions of the minutes are in progress and will be caught up as soon as possible
thanks a lot 
i grok that honestly and truly and if ccp is going to scrap lss there might as well be a csm proposal for how to do that butthe reason that most noob subscribers leave the game isnt some fault of the game its because eve is inherently a niche product eve is a pvp mmo where most other such titles are fps games eve has a tremendously harsh death penalty and a playerdriven economy to support and take advantage of the use and loss of ships it revolves around a harsh and unforgiving universe where players fight for everything from market share to viable trade routes to control of hundreds of star systems in 00 space its got a famous learning curve the reason most noobs dont stick around is because eve is not their kind of a game that wont ever change unless and until ccp changes eve enough that its no longer what weve all known as eve that is if ccp decides that rather than being a quality niche product they want real market share and kill the game in order to get it that does not seem like a good path for the playerbase although im sure ccps accountants would love it i understand that it looks like ccp may implement something like that at some point and if theyre going to they might as well be given some hints so they dont totally  it sideways but far better would be simply not fixing it since its not actually broken
i appreciate your perspective and with my purist hat on i might even agree with it but when i put my gamedesigner hat on i dont like learning skills so much and when i put my business hat on i like then even lesseve will of course always be a game with a learning cliff but from a business perspective raising the noob retention rate even 1 is a huge win in the long termin any case the balls in their court now it will be interesting to see what happens
if they do away with learning skills they should reimburse players for the sp this will actually benefit newer players more than older players while an older player may be able to throw that 45 days of training into 2 or 3 skills they have at level 4 and immediately get them to level 5  5 gain in each skill for a total of  1015 a newer player will be able to throw that 45 days of training into 2 or 3 skills bringing them from level 0 to level 4  plus 20 per skill for a total of  40 60 improvement
maybe next time venkul ill make a power point presentation and discuss the idea in a committee before i post it in a suggestion thread how new a player are we talking about i consider someone running level 3 or 4 missions not to be all that new you may have a point with level 2 missions seems like most of your criticisms with my suggestions are fixed with minor tweaks if thats all youve got against it maybe you should expand on my ideas instead of complaining about their presentationbtw i run missions in npc nullsec without any corp support everyone else there is a potential hostile and i dont have any major problems i dont see a need to make missions unscanablethe gap between old and new is huge already i support making it easier for new players to get into the game which is one reason why i support removing pointless barriers like learning skills i would love a fresh server assuming everything wrong with the game was fixed first but thats so unlikely its not worth discussing i really dont think my suggestions are going to make it significantly worse for new vs old new players have lost the catch up battle in terms of spsisk before they begin it will make a bigger gap between smart vs dumb active vs macroafk risk taker vs risk averse but all those things are strongly positive outcomes for eve btw what are your suggestions for low sec looking at your posts in this thread i dont see any only criticism for someone that has posted so many times here on this topic i would expect you would have some ideas of your own beyond a poorly veiled bias against pirate player types
do that you would make something better so a guy that has played 1 month for you is a veteran with a drake or a raven you can run level 4 mission in that timeframe if you choose them carefully and you will die horribly to any pvper been there done that often easiest than low sec maybe not now if after tyrannis the missions send regularly you out of the system i disagree as both are opinions i doubt we will ever get to an agreement mostly i would leave low sec as it is todayi think that one of the ways to increase population in low sec would be making scanning people more difficult even if most pirates are for the instant gratification and dont think on the long term on the long run it would be beneficial for them too getting a gradual increase in potential targets would after a time get them more kills as most pirates would cry like child at the idea that scanning ships should be made more difficult it will not be implemented even if in the long ran would help themlow sec problem is simple too many predators for too little prey sadly the predators will not starve even if the prey disappear as they will get isk doing missions or selling gtc so essentially low sec is incurable without changing a lot of basic assumptions of the game and making it something different trying to force people there will not cure low sec when you try to force people in a game you only get to  them off eve is heavily addictive so they will endure for a period but most of them will not move to low sec they will simply change what they do and if the game become boring enough they will leave if you look the last quen the increase of wh population is partially at the expenses of low sec that mean that the current low sec population includes practically all people interested in that playstile and that they found wh space agreeable to it too after all 8 of all eve population in low sec mean that 8 of the players use about 8 of the systems including whs what you want high sec population density in low sec
im happy with the csm but one improvement i would suggest is that you all make more use of assembly hall discussions in the logs from the last 2 meetings i saw a few arguments that seem to come out of left field regarding these proposals that is they were never mentioned in the relevant ah thread if i had read them in assembly hall i definitely would have posted some reasons to reconsider those particular positions but now its a bit late since you already voted of course you do not always need to post your rationales there especially if your argument is already made in the tthread by someone else but if you are sitting back thinking an idea is good or bad for reasons that have not even been brought up in assembly hall that would be a good time to post your ideas there first if its a doozy its better that you post it there and find out then have it forever saved in the csm wikiim not suggesting you should post in every thread in ah but if a thread is going to be voted on you may want to read it and if your views are not already represented you may want to throw them out so more of the players can weigh init can only be a bonus to eve if we have more people adding some constructive comments in ah
patch time incoming let see what will happens in term of quality cheersyeay
did you see this dev blog   new dev blog when patching fails repairi like the irony in my bad frenchenglish i understand the followingccp ask us to repair the client if they fail their patch then its an invitation for us to do the job cause ccp fail i like this kind of customer serviceamazing how translation between languages can lead to misunderstanding yeaynot trolling just busy waiting a ccp answer
after reading their blog it seems as though they just shelved fixing anything for quite some time yes i understand the need to bring in a larger crowd market by creating the complete science fiction experience but at some point they are going to start losing that crowd of dedicated players the reason eve has grown steadily is the fact that it has not been losing much of the original player base i hope that eventually the message gets through because all the summary of the csm meetings has shown us is that they have a massive backlog of issues that they have no intention of looking at with 18 months and even when they do get around to fixing the large backlog of issues they will only touch a few of them and then get back to something new and shiny i know my words fall on deaf ears but 90 pages should say something about the growing demand for an increased quality control1 for committing to a standard of excellence and follow through with it this time

ehh theres already a huge number of high sec belts that are wiped out hours after they re spawn lowering their yields would only make this worse youd be surprised at what macros are capable of nowadays no i dont use them but i have looked at them within a few months from ingame mechanic changes theyve written a way around them its analogous to counterfeiting currency plus as stated before the macroers would manually find 45 belts you describe and then execute their macro just come back in an hour or three and its done i still favor the belt mechanic changes ccp mentioned a fanfest or three ago it doesnt really do much to thwart macroers but it would be a nice change each rock would have a variable and somewhat random amount of minerals as opposed to asteroid type a having a fixed ratio of minerals you would have to use your scanner to investigate the rocks if you are cherrypicking for a certain mineral it also proposed that mining skills and equipment would effect the ratio and types yielded from mining it wouldnt just be massconsume all veld for n amount of trit chribba would be safe though as there likely would still be rocks named veldspar
my proposal is to give people free sp on tranq if they show up at a x amount of mass tests rewards are fun but sp are the way to go ccp the system to award sp are allready in placeim thinking of 300000 sp bonus if a char shows up at 3 tests the sps will be availeble for the character that has the most skillpoints on the account

obvious troll is obviousat any rate i forgot to give my own proposal a thumbs up so here goes at any rate adding various gambling games to eve will only add to the fun one can have walking around in stations if no valued content is added besides the ability to walk around whos going to do it the only thing so far ive found interesting is the corp war planning table one thing i would like to add is that games like craps could even allow the player to somewhat control how the dice are thrown rather than just throwing out random numbersbut speaking of random i guess slot machines wouldnt be a bad thing either although i probably wouldnt play them
yes pleeeese
i like where this is going but lets find something else to use instead of clicking
if you fit your mining fleet for max yieldefficiency youre situational awareness and ability to defend yourself will suffer if the profits are low then go do the thing where profits are high also typing entire posts in bold is douchebaggery of the highest degree and that is mostly the reason why youve been tagged as a troll which you are and ive just fed
actually this idea has merit it would help clean up the politics involved in which charity it goes too and it promotes playing the game at the same time

arr but only isd characters can mine isd asteriods fields the population of these asteriod fields are regulated by ccp in the same way as opec controls and regulates the oil yes there are legal issues and afew things to be sorted out but this will happen maybe not in my gaming career but this is in the future as like any new online game you will want to get in at the begining to get yourself in a strong positionim not phased it was turned down and you could be totally right that ccp has other issue in game to fix but i believe that eve online is very economically strong and is in a position to bring this idea to fruitation to get this strong they dont have dummies at the wheel
o woohoo
supporting thisand as avoiding concord is an exploit the person attacked can wait as long as they want before pressing the button since it would be an exploit to selfdestruct to avoid concord youd be imprisoned in that system for ever and ever and ever
i kind of like the concept as it pertains to highsec as for low no way it takes away the distinction of lowsec granted lowsec needs some kind of attention or boost as it were but this is not the kind it needs
i am new to the game so this may seem a bit naivei have been developing my mining skills and working within a corp but we are small  but growing often there is no one to haul ore or provide cover so i resort to jetcan mining i realize the risks i run doing this even in highsec but it seems the canflippers run no risk at all they swoop in with a cheap frigate flip the can watch to see if i aggro them then disappear for the 15 minute freefire time by the time i get to the station to get something that will shoot bullets they have disappeared andor the freefire time has expired i would also like to suggest extending that freefire time period to  oh 48 hours or so pleasewhat i would like to propose is the option  with skill books i figured that much out about the game already  to provide the miner with the ability to hide a surprise in the jetcan the simplest form could take the form of an explosive  skill level 1 would kill a frigate level 2 a destroyer level 3 a cruiser level 4 a bc and industrial and level 5 a bs and a hulk obviously the miner would lose the can and the contents but it might add a bit of spice to the canflippers day they could still flip cans but they would have some skin in the gamea second option would be to allow the miner to secrete a portable webstatis unit that would hold the flipper  when activated for the life of the freefire period skill level 1 would allow the use of one mobile webstasis unit level 2 2 mod units and so on units would be lost if the can popsa third option  one that could also leak over into pvp and real battles  and is probably much more complicated would be the use of deployable missile pods each unit would selfcontain a targeting unit and a small tractor unit to attach itself to the mother ship deployed units would be lost with the usual two hours delay if the mother ship warped without retrieving missile skills would apply something new for most miners and the missle pod skill level would determine the number of pods you could manage they would need to be retrieved to be reloadedi have read in the eve guides that jetcan mining is the recommended method of mining if that is true then it does deserve some supportthank you for your consideration
first off welcome to evesecondly the guides full of crapjet can mining is very foolish people who do it are most likely going to get targetedas you no doubt realizedif your going to can mine then you should do so in 7 systems or lower and giant secure canspros you anchor the can and password it and no one can flip your can unless your password suckscons cans much smallerfills up fastbest method  like it or not mining by yourself is inefficient and just not the kind of thing people do as far as professional miners and if they do its with backupsecurity near by so your better off getting yourself into a retriever and eventually a hulk most miners have more than one char if not more than one account to help haulbottom line  most would call your proposal stupid and full of carebear tears of which they so lovingly enjoy so complaining about the most dangerous form of mining is begging to get trolledbut you dont strike me as anything but just a simple newb as opposed to noobso take my advise get a friend preferably in an large hauler or orcadont jet can mine unless you want to get can flippedfrequently that or go find some dead end system on the fringes of high sec spacefeel free to eve mail me in game if you want some more tipsibtroll posts
jetcan mining for a starting newbie is one way to start mining however unless you know what youre doing youre asking to get canflippedways to avoid getting canflipped1 dont jetcan mine get a buddy or 2nd account who hauls your minerals off any serious miner does this its generally called a mining op where you have a small fleet of hulksretrievers bunch up around an orca dumping all their minerals directly into the orca  no cans  the orca boosting the miners with faster cycles more range and more yield and a hauler who accesses the orca and takes out the minerals then flies to station with them and dumps them in a corporate hangar  or if hes trusted just into his hangar bay and its sorted out at the end of the op 2 if you really cant do the above find a quiet system somewhere in a dead end or other place remote so theres little chance of a canflipper coming by to flip your can3 a little dangerous but also an option flip back your canwhen theyve done the flip with their frigate fly back grab your hauler with enough room to take the entire can with you  or at least most of it  he will probably have flown off waiting out his timer go to the can open it but dont loot align to station and just before warp grab everything inside the can then wait out your 15 minute timer for flipping his can
lol this couldnt be further from the truth jetcan mining is not a recommended method of mining because of can flippers whomever recommended this to you is either incredibly stupid or trying to get some laughs out of it at your expensedont jetcan plain and simple or if you absolutely must use cans go anchor a couple of secure cargo containers in 07 and below
as much as i like the idea of a garbage can bomb i dont like it from a gameplay standpointim 25 days to exhumers and i still work in jet cans i dual box a hauler which you cant train on trial accounts nor can you dual box with a trial account and work through a few secure containers however i still find myself filling a jet can to 45k m3 every so often based on practicality its just a matter of searching for a quiet enough system to do your mining in even the quietest will get flippers here and there but it beats most hi sec systems where you are pretty much assured of getting flipped every hour or so train up drones and your tanking to be able to mine 05 and your options open up considerably but getting help hauling is not just important to avoid flippers itll also keep your mining lasers going nonstop and if you do use containers be sure to anchor them
mining is best with orca or hauling support but jetcan mining can be done in relative safety if youre in the right spot and use some common sense i have a hulk and still frequently jet can mine from time to time i do get flipped and sometimes i switch to a pvp ship and get a kill sometimes not all in all though i make out quite well its all about location location location keeping your eyes on local and knowing who the flippers are in the area your mining in i dont jet can mine near trade hubs and even take the time of day day of the week into account when i dolike everything in eve its about risk and reward
no sorry this works as it should and your personal risk with mining is just about zero the belt rats hardly count if you crap fit a mining barge or have crap skills you could lose the ship to them and you did it not the ratsfor a smaller corp you can have the worst yielding miner crappiest ship use the best cargo hauling fit on their industrial they can and you jetcan they take all but 1 unit of ore as you mine and fill their hold someone comes along you can stop pause take a break or take the chance they nab the ore before your buddy doesa better idea would be to find a good system 07 or lower with around 10 belts or more anchor and set a decent password on giant secure containers in a string through the belt 5k from each other so that you can fly along the string mine the best roids in your mining range fill the cans while moving to the next one never stopping your lasers the more people the more stringscans you setup and maybe have several sites at belts in the system or a neighboring system until someone moves up to an orcaif you want to lay traps for can flippers have your best combat pilot pop a can you jet mine into it and he goes away either somewhere in space sitting in his uber pwnmobile  or whatever he is willing to risk to take out a can flipper for them to steal your ore from his can he then can fire on them you signal him to come in and get the guy hilarity ensues your friend can also go out of system in the event the flipper checks to see who owns the can and looks at local
drakes advice is pretty spot on if youre solo mining get into a hulk asap and fit it for max cargo space if youre mining in a group have someone be a dedicated hauler that way you only have to put the ore into sapce long enough for them to tractor it over and unload the can best solution is get a friend in an orca not only do you get more cargo space than you can shake a stick at you get the mining boosts which let you mine faster
lets be honest  most of the topics posted in assembly hall are halfbaked ideas that want to get more attention by posting in here than in the rarely touched fi at the end of the day they have essentially the exact same content except one gets some viewing by the general eve forumites the other gets basically nonefis usefulness has been marginalized by ah so something needs changing either bite the bullet and simply merge them or find some real way of differentiating between the topics that should be posted in the two forums and have the mods start moving stuffalso this is half baked idea 
oh please ccp doesnt care about either of them those are just places to troll for our own entertainment
or stop posting halfbaked ideas in assembly hall leave those in features  ideas where they can get the attention they deserve nicely selfreferential post here though
no there is overlap but that is the playersposters fault for not thinking stuff through ah is for more structured complete ideassuggestions ideally they are essentially done by the view of the poster if submitted properly they address the majority of issues people would bring up so that players can vote straight up or down and of course explain why or why notfi is more for the discussion exploration of ideas they are not necessarily ready to be turned in to ccp and seek more feedbackinformation the poster might not havecrossover happens not everyone reads the descriptions or stickies to see what should go where and in some cases the posts can get off topic skewing a more formal proposal especially if it is poorly thoughtoutexplained towards a discussion on the idea same can happen with fi where an idea might just be so simple that most people agree with it or want it naowtldr i want icecream

when picking up illegal items from containers or wrecks in space there is not a warning however there is a warning when you try and exit a station or jump to a place where it is illegal it would be a very easy fix and would be toggleable like the other options to prevent you from being caught with contraband
there is a warning asking you if you want to confirm the steal you must have checked the box dont show this warning againhappy flipping
no not stealing its from loot from rat wrecks which i have the right to take from im talking about boosters and slaves
ah sorry read your post to quickly dunno not a big deal to me i usually leave the garbage isk items behind like drugs anyway
this seems to me pretty obviously a bug why on earth would they intend for anyone with a wreck to have an aggression timer that extends at the option of the aggressor without any act by the aggressed until the wreck despawns doesnt that defeat the entire purpose of having aggression timers of fixed duration tied to specific acts of aggressionjust because it was well known in some communities doesnt make it less of a bugtwo question then first for now is whether exploiting it will result in bans and the like it seems like empirically the answer is no  has anyone gotten banned for this doesnt look likesecond is whether it will be fixed at any point im putting the overunder at 18 months 
hellowhat about the dev blog in the resume plucking the harp one more timei wanted to bring up the csm again before signing off on this blog masstesting is not just about data or testing fixes it is about involving the eve community in assessing the overall quality of eve we feel very strongly that eves players must be involved at some level in the discussion about the quality of the game you folks are after all the ones who play it day in and day out you spend your free hours in the universe which weve built so you should always have a say in how good or bad you think that universe is working obviously it isnt feasible for us to have oneonone discussions with everyone so we have to find some more workable middle ground we believe weve found a very appropriate one in the csm these are the people whom you all elect to represent you to ccp these are the people who will carry your issues your gripes and your kudos to uswe have struck up a new commitment with the csm to build a sustainable and open dialog between ccp and the players about the quality and performance of eve this means that the csm will be able to bring concerns to us more readily and that we can in return work together to ensure that we effectively communicate about those issues with all of you this isnt limited to just the current causes of lag but any issue that may crop up later that makes eve run poorly or limits the ability for people to have amazing 1000 fleet fight once again we feel this is a very positive change and look forward to working more closely with the csm towards more effective communication and better masstestswaiting backlog point with impatienceif its somewhere please link me the pagecheersyeay
i didnt say nor imply they were a veteran i said they werent new if your reaching a stage of the game where your making good isk there should also be risk i dislike the dynamic of pve in safety to gain pvp strength ala eq wow coh etc in every other mmo that claimed to be sandbox and pvp orientated pve occurred within the pvp environment in eve this isnt entirely the case only empire wardecers ninja salvagerslooters and suicide gankers make it not entirely the caseright because like everyone else they can run missions etc in high sec with an alt in near complete safety same with some null sec players that do the same i applaud your consideration for new players but a lot of the players taking advantage of the risk imbalance in eve are older players even low sec pirates and null sec sov holders even those that are currently strictly mission runners or miners that have no interest in pvp ship fights might choose to venture into low sec if the reward warranted the risk but for most it doesnt even if theyre smart enough to manage the risk and additional associated effort the difference is still too small from what can be achieved in high yes major changes are needed and ought to be implemented i dont think those changes would make eve something radically different in terms of core concept it would still be eve granted it would shatter some player assumptions and established behavior but ultimately for the betterment of the game as a whole some may leave others may come you cant satisfy everyone and i dont think those that treat eve like a pve themepark are the ones ccp should be trying to satisfy however empire space is already filled with players that already live in null or low sec with another character or theyre predators that have adapted and migrated to empire space i see no reason for those players to packup and leave eve should such changes be madeits not really a question of wanting more density although seeing more than half of characters are living in empire space is an indication of a problem with the dynamics of the game its a question of balance of risk effort and reward its also seeing that in a game lauded as a pvp game and one where everything influences everything else that all major isk faucets come with pvp attached
i try to keep up on all the major ah threads and certainly the ones that will be discussed in meetings its currently taking 23 hours a day to perform my csm dutieskeep in mind that csms dont just consider whats in the threads but also use their own experience and judgment and those of their ingame associates sometimes being human one or more of us get things wrong about an issue thats one reason there are 9 of us votingif a particular issue is important to you then do the timehonored thing lobby your representatives send them mail about particular issues stating your position and arguments squeaky pods get the lube as vuk would say
it is on my radar for a future csm meeting i try to raise one issue a meeting picking the most interesting current proposal last week i raised two but one got deferred
did i not support this before my bad

supported diedra expresses exactly what i thinkbut honestly the only way how you can make ccp change their behaviour is to quit eve in masses for let us say 3 months and to say ill be back in 3 months if you havent fixed it till then ill leave for another 3 months and so on find 10000 accounts whose owner would support you and quit their subscription for at least a month and you may have success with that

bumppsthe best reason to train gal right now is for angel faction ships
my bs still goes over 1200 msobvious it isnt a mega a mega in 2006 did 12501400ms depending on the mwd before they added mass to the mwdsa 90 web was 4 times stronger than a 60 is now if you want more range there is still caldari amarr or mini dps is quite comparable in general game play i for myself dont see any reason to increase range there are a lot ships that can do this already

xorv i have taken class that teach you how to take notes in class and classes that teach you how to teach yourself and classes that teach you how to take test so i would have to say that there are learning skills in real life and classes for thoughs skills
i think she is pointing out that before you post next time i recommend you take a basic reasoning class  would probly be a learning class
mybe not but there are learning classes in real life that can teach you to read faster learn faster and test faster and get better grades
then she completely missed the point basic reasoning classes teach you how to present logical structured arguments and be aware of fallacies etc it gives you something tangible much as a skill in eve like diplomacy improves your relations with hostile factions or nanite engineering which allows you to use research agents in that field if i spend time training one of these skills i am learning this is true but then what are learning skills and why do we need them in evethere are basic reason classes courses in college and uni theyre usually part of the philosophy department and are first year courses ive seen workshops that are effectively there to help you learn learning skills i suppose but theyre not needed nor taken by most students and only occupy a few hours for those that do the more appropriate representation of this would be the tutorials for starter characters not lengthy skills that actually need to be trained for potentially months when you get down to it theres only one reason for the learning skills in eve and thats to add a time sink and in that respect i understand why some of eves community want to keep them because theres always been some mmorpg gamers that love time sinks and grinding that divides those that have jumped through the hoops of tedium and those who have not or will not perhaps to those same people this equates also to depth and choice to the rest of us however it is pointless tedious time sink and nothing more

as it is right now most pos modules are unusable by alliance members because of the restriction on corp hangar access to corp members only i suggest that this be remedied by adding a roles table to be applied on accessing the corp hangar of any pos module that is set for use by alliance by a character that is in the alliance but not in the corpthis would finally allow renting or otherwise sharing pos assembly slots and lab slots to alliance members opening up possibilities that have be unavailable since the restrictions on corp hangar access were first added furthermore it would do so in a predictable and controllable way
ive never understood how you can share a ship maint arraybut not a corp hanger arrayunderstandably this compounds the theft thing but thats a big part of eveim in favor of it as it would make life easier in whs
for the love of god yesi can share smas with my alliance mates why cant i set one corp hanger to alliance yes and another alliance no just like the smafix eetedithi drake
wholeheartedly supportedit makes doing alliance wide operations a pain in the butt especially in mining ops and suchif you have an orca that is not in your corp you cant have the haulers take stuff from it because its not their corps hangar  you can configure it to accept stuff but you cant see what you dumped also alliance posses cant be accessed at all because youre not in the same corp having some way to configure certain hangars for alliance wide use would be aweseome it would mean you could have a bunch of ships and whatnot ready for use in hangars and when the pos is attacked all alliance members could go and grab one to defend the pos in case the ship they came in got blown upmaybe also some way to allow alliance members  not in the same corp  to anchor structures onto a pos that is configured to do so as well like installing guns or onlining them or putting up some extra hangars or whatnota mechanic to allow use of well anything in the pos would also be very usefull
insert approving comment herewould also be handy if alliance members with the right roles could use the pos guns
very much supported

recently ive become disappointed to learn that strategic cruisers grant only a dismal 5 locked targets this strikes me as particularly odd given that every tech3 ship recommends core competency  standard and in turn targeting v and multitasking itech 3 ships fill a myriad of roles sometimes taking on positions as ewar logistics and damage all in one fight expecting them to do this adequately with only 5 targets is not reasonablesimply put the targeting subsystems of these tech3 ships leave something to be desired when even the lowly thrasher boasts 6 target locks shouldnt the tengu or loki be able to exceed that without burdening itself with autotargeterstldr increase strategic cruiser maximum locked targets value from 5 to 7
i too find this really annoying and i would prefer to see this changed since i fly them regularly however if it is a means to have some semblance of balancing vs nont3 then i think i can live with that
if this purposal was more along the lines of make one of the subsystems offer more maximum targets i would be for thathowever a t3 cruiser is still a cruiser yes its a pimpmobile yes its meant to more powerful and more adaptible than the t1t2 cruisers but asking for it to be given the same max targets of a bs is a little absurd
a thorax a tech 1 cruiser has 6 target slots buff all subsystems max target locks to at least 6 and maybe more on the dissolution sequencer

why oh why cannot ccp address the need for a countdown to the expiry date on the character selection page    surely it would be better for the players not needing to log into eve central to see how much time is left until the account expires    come on ccp  look after your paying people a lot better
there already is one it becomes visible when you have 10 days or less on your subscription works just fine but feel free to continue to rage and capitalize odd words in your sentences
it doesnt seem to work with all payment options  some accounts i have get it others dont i really should pay attention to which billing methods generate it
right it only shows up if you prepaid and not if you canceled a recurring payment i dont think it works with paypal either

first let me say i support this idea cause i can see it making 00 acctualy more dangerous again as it should be in my eyesi however have some concerns  questions what would you do about persons that leave their charackters in stations after being kicked from the corp they would not have standings and could not be force dropped out of the station by anyone yet have full access to local i am against the idea of making it a module it would surely favor a forward scout on roams but it would be a cutback on making it more dangerous as local is like half the intel you can geti see option 2 as reasonable and good and would like to see an attention message in local when such an object is anchored like danger communications servers are taken over by an outside force firewalls at xx and falling or somaybe even go so far to give the aggressor who anchored the building the control of the local channel alternatively you could give it a timer for different layers to be breached until full control is granted but nothing with invulnerability stuff like on buggy sbuone of the main issues with hacking would however be to determine as in how far the invading factions standings are considered for example you anchor building x and get access to local would your allied alliance y have access aswell due to their standing towards youwould there be a limit for buildings of that kind to be anchored like giving the possibility for a 3way battle
currently there is no confirmation when cancelling market orders leading to annoyance when accidentally cancelling instead of modifying an order as the items are next to each other on the menui therefore propose addition of a confirmation dialogue to alleviate this annoyance
yes pleasemost of my order cancellation errors have been due to lag where i hover my mouse over the modifier button but in reality its over the ing cancel buttonlosing millionsbillions in fees and taxes is not ing funny

i would like to thank all who replied so gently to my suggestions  or perhaps i could classify them as illconsidered fantasiesi appreciate the willingness of those who have gone before to help those of us who are noobs or newbies not only in the forums but in the whole of the eve experience it is a true indication of the quality of character attracted to the game while i still wish for the capability to defend myself from a flipper i may convert from mining barge to battleship mining for one of my characters to all for this in certain situationsagain thank you all for your time and consideration of my wistful thinking
as stated the hulk is the epitome of mining ubersaucewhen it comes to jet can mining and having your stuff stolen i feel for youwhich is why i also went with the max cargo fit but then i took it a step further a hulk with 2x cargo i rigs and 2x cargo ii mods can carry 17199 m3 a giant secure container takes up 3000 m3 and holds 3900 m3 30 bonus a huge secure container takes up 1500 m3 and holds 1950 m3 30 bonus a large secure container takes up 650 m3 and holds 780 m3 20 bonusso a hulk can hold 5x gsc 1x hsc and 1x lsc with a grand total of 22230 m3 in containers plus an extra 49 m3 in the hold itselfthe only trick is to kick 2 empty gsc out to make room for the ore to fall in the hold initially then you keep it inside the ship and only fill those 2 gsc when everything else is topped off that way theres nothing to flip but 2 empty cans
undocking game players wont like thiswhat they should do instead is making gaint secure containers not so tiny
no you shouldnt be mining alone anywayscan mining is only effective with orca support who can tractor the can and hold the ore for youthe easist way to defend your jet can is have someone else pick it up there is no other way around itthe best solution is to not mine but do mission or trade

everytime someone mentions the 18 months bullsht i have a shot right now im on my third liver its shocking how far a little misinformation can go ccp isnt sitting on theyre butts for the next 18 months to troll the forums theyre implimenting some shiney sht but this unfortunately means that the spit and polish of existing content is taking a backseat this doesnt mean theyre not working on lag fixes and the like entirely check out the devblogs released in the last few days
dev blogs are filled with nothing but hot air and potential the proof is in the released productexhibit a ccps push for excellence about a year ago har har

a push for excellence doesnt mean well be 100 excellent within a year transperancy may be an issue which the current dev blogs are doing a relatively nice job of clearing up if youd actually bother to read them but asking for a 100 completedneverhavetofix game is utterly ing ed

world of warcraft does something similar and i think that would be a good system to adopt here each chat tab can be userconfigured to show chat from multiple channels and a slashcommand is used to specify which channel outgoing chat is being sent to15 the text typed here would go to whatever channel you specified as channel 15 on your interface
a problem with learning skills they put noobs off the game the problem was the idiots in the noob help channel spamming train learning skills first at all the new players when better advice was to encourage them to train up what skills they needed to make a start in game and get on playing and enjoying themselves then to train learning as they went alongthis situation has unfortunately been compounded by the present character creation system which lets face it is more geared to the creation of alts than for completely new players this i believe is where you should be focusing your attentionwhy are people supporting the idea of removing learning skills simple selfinterest everyone has their eye on the bundle of skill points that they hope and expect to receive to reallocate they want to escape the consequences of choice they made in game always he worst impulse in evethis whole endeavour is misdirected in my opinion what needs addressing is the present character creation system and we would be better served by discouraging ccp from implementing the trend towards skillpoint reallocation
yep the best thing we can do now is take note of the 4 csms that spoke out and voted against this proposal and make sure they get our votes next time and the others dont this issue more than any other probably decided where my csm vote will go next round
as someone who has tried to get friends into this game im a big fan of removing learning skills the 3 main problems ive had 1 tutorial very boring 2 they make it through the tutorial but do the math and start doing learning skills and interest is gone when they are done 3 no customizeable avatar that they can identify with female friends for this one id love to see something done about 2 as its hard to maintain interest in eve in those initial stages and realizing that the best thing they can do long term is to not play the game for a few daysweeks at the start certainly doesnt help things sure they could not train learning skills however the typical gamer who might be interested in eve is typically going to be the type that tends to minmax to some degree and telling them not to train learning skills conflicts with what seems to be the best long term plan i also disagree with any notion that learning skills add something to the game what do they add there is no long term customization since you need them all except maybe charisma its not like you can train 1 learning skill to 6 and the others only to 5 or something when i make choices training in eve i need to choose between different ships or specializing more in 1 ship or learning a new one there is no similar choice w learning skills because i need percwill for all the shipweapon skills and i need intmem for all the support skills all they seem to add is a patience test for how long can you wait to train real skills in order to benefit long term i personally think weve got enough patience tests in eve and removing the learning skill one will be a nice improvement to the game
hiim one of those unfortunate noobs who recently created an account focused on my learning skills and im now working toward others actually i created the account several months ago on a trial real life came up and i just got back to the game last week but still new playerafter reading the minutes of the meeting i would like to offer some feedback as a new player 1 there was some concern in the minutes that refunding sp to everyone would hurt new players more than help them because of the amount of sp the veteran players would recieve i offer this as a possible solutionthough i understand it could be quite the headache from the coding side perhaps refunded points from learning skills could only be reallocated to skills with the same training time multiplier for example points that have been refunded to me from analytical mind x1 multiplier could be invested in mining or other low multiplier skills but not deep core mining x6 multiplier it would minimize the negative effects on newer characters that invested their initial time in learning skills while giving veteran players who may have chosen to ignore certain skill groups a chance to invest them and at the same time not widen the gap as it were 2 offer characters a different avenue for increased skill progression that does not slow down initial game progression and explorationmy problem with skill progression as a new player is that by investing the time to max out learning skills i create a lull in my game play where i have zero motivation to play my character until other skills catchup the inflated game economy has made it so i have already purchased a bigger better ship for miningone whose hold size makes it the equivalent of 23 mining trips on my current frigate it seems kind of silly to mine anything in my frigate for the next 4 days while i want for my ship flying skills to catch up so ive done my starter missions i have my newer better ship waiting for me and my skill progression is on a static time table what can i do no much so i dont log into the gameso i suggest two very different ways to replace the learning skills that would make character development a bit faster and a bit more player orientated a implement primarysecondary stat increases from capping out skills with lower multipliers in their respective disciplines example taking 3 ranks of industry before learning 1 rank in mass production vs taking 5 ranks of industry before learning 1 rank in mass production taking the time to gain 5 ranks of industry first would shorten the time it takes to learn 1 rank mass production obviously it would still take longer overall learning 5 ranks  1 rank vs 3 ranks  1 rank 1 but that that 1 rank in mass productionand subsequent ones would be faster the character increases their statslearning speed of higher skills by completing the ranks of their lower onesorb grant bonus skill points from completing missions related to the discipline you are training in if im waiting 10 days for strip mining to finish itd be nice if i could speed up the process by doing mining missions in the game maybe work towards removing a day or two off the clock its not much but it gives me an excuse to play the gamei know most of you vets dont need that you have other skills that allow you to do other things while your current skills are training however as a new player in a frigate youre a bit limited in your choices and itd be nice to have missions increase the rate you learn your desired skills thank you for your time
low sec is non competitive for several reasons and isk generation is only one of those low sec is much more stressfulpeople returning from work and wanting to relax dont want to stay at maximum alert while mining or ratting for a lot of them high sec is the perfect ambient to do that not all people are adrenaline junkies that want the excitement of fake danger and not all people feel the adrenaline rushing when they have a pvp encounter for me the standard reaction is on the lines of another nuisance uff most low sec pvp is so devoid of reason to be beside another killmail that i find it totally uninteresting not that high sec wardec are much better i find much more interesting the market and the industrial activity something that is seriously hampered by low sec eve is a sandbox and as a sandbox it cater to all kinds of playstiles you want it to cater only to your stile of gaming what make you better than the other players
are you sure this proposal is really resolvedi dont remember seeing this feature in any of the recent patch notes
so many great ideas so little dev love
such a great idea
not supported because it perpetuates the idea that plexes should exist in the first place if you are not a roleplayer plexes are boring work for effectively no reward at all if you are a roleplayerthey are boring and entirely arbitrary work for the reward of having served your country in some utterly unquantifiable and illogical waywhy were these tactical sites built in deep space rather than in proximity to important things like moons planets stargates or stationswhy do the beacons need a capsuleer to secure themwhat does securing them actually do and why does a capsuleer orbiting one for an entirely arbitrary length of time make it somehow impossible for a capsuleer on the same side to do exactly the same thingwhy in a plex being contested by an enemy dont all the reinforcement waves just warp in at once and kill him why dont reinforcement waves warp in to back up a friendly capsuleer under attackwhy does a defensive plex being revealed by a friendly capsuleer cause it to show up in localwhy are you not given rewards for running plexes in uncontested systems when securing these plexes ensures that they will not be attacked by the enemywhy are capsuleers from an allied militia fired on but someone clearly capturing the plex is not as long as they have positive standings with the faction the plex belongs towhy are plexes not brought online where theyre needed ie deeply contested systems rather than in a completely random distribution why are capsuleers given loyalty points for killing each other  destroying entirely replacable assets with other entirely replacable assets  but not for capturing plexeswhy would any of the factions entrust immediate and vital matters of national security to capsuleers who almost never do anything thats not either profitable fun or bothplexes dont need to be revamped they need to be replaced utterly and all evidence that they ever existed needs to be cleansed with holy fire
actually a very good point you bring up why have plexeswhat could replace them though some sort of activity metric like you have for 00 indicestonnage player ships destroyedtonnagevalue npc ships destroyedships in space over timewhat should differentiate offensivedefensive values if anything personally never understood why capsuleers needs to defend with not hostiles in sightps i would hate to lose the size restricted nature of plexes as it is a godsend for funchallenging fights but if a superior system could be devised it is a small sacrifice to make
this well said agas the famous quote goes the time for talk is through now is the time for action or something to that effect i left eve about 6 or 8 months ago and decided i would only come back on occasion just to see if things have been fixed or even touched ive been back for about two weeks now thanks in part to a please come back we miss you heres a free week email and as soon as my month is over yeah a week isnt long enough i subbed for a month ill probably be gone again a couple of recent dev blogs may sway me to stay if they keep talking like they have been but only for long enough to give them a chance to show they finally get iti love this game and love the players but the attitude is beyond my tolerance level i completely understand quantity over quality in most areas but eve is not that type of game eve players are intelligent people we dont play eve for something pretty to look at for a few hours we play eve for a chance to live another life if that life stays as screwed up as real life well find another distraction eventuallymy biggest fear is that ccp realizes this and they realize the most money can be made by attracting people who are impressed by shinnies and in their bid to gain more shinnylovers they will completely ruin what could very well be the best game ever createdoh and wheres the fix rockets thread
thx for the support though i would like to make something clear i am not playing eve for the chance to live another life and i dont think that it is as screwed up as rl since at least my rl isnt srewed up at all if i would need a chance to live another life i would just change my rli am not blaming ccp for screwing up my scifi fantasy world gaming is just a hobby but i like games which are complicated and force you to think a lot to analyze to think strategically and i hate it when companys start to put quantity before quality unfortunately the most game developers do that there are only few exceptions like blizzard this is when stupid mistakes start to happen like the thing with pi where every 2nd semester economics student could have told them that this is going to happen the qm of ccp seems to be broken since the fix rockets thread is already 1 year old and nothing has happened yet they even failed to scale the capitals appropriately ccp seem not to realize that their clientel aint a bunch of teenagers eve clientel is demanding and wants qualitythere is a nice example daimlerbenz tried to increase profits by decreasing quality in the 1990s and it worked for a short period of time till the customers realized that they were buying expensive crap after this short period of time couple of years the revenue of mercedes dropped dramatically and the costs for guarantee items increased at the same time maybe ccp needs to make their own experiences
perhaps there needs to be a second proposal that 18 months is too long this one supported nonetheless

seriously ccp we all know these are hard economic times here i present an idea which will make you rich and keep your userbase well fedi suggest you open up a worldwide chain of pizza delivery joints where you can pay with plex you can even recycle the ship fitting window code for toppings design

this so many times this but it better be one tasty pizza
definitely yes would be perfect for all the ctas that demand players stay near their computers at all times
we expect to get some information soon but it may be a little while before we can say anything keep in mind that ccp traditionally has been very reticent to talk about a particular item until they are sure that they can deliver the goodswhile we understand their caution we hope that increased communication between ccp and csm and between ccp and the players will foster an environment where ccp can be more forthcoming at an earlier stage and where the players are more accepting of the fact that sometimes stuff has to go on the backburner when the fecal matter hits the rotary impeller
i didnt really expect a detailed roadmap to the next release at this pointsomething like meetings over all big questions were addressed we will sort out the details wrap it up nicely and get back to you in 2 weeks would have been awesomeespecially since that is something you can plan with soon is really next to worthless when you hear it from ccp as it can mean anything from 2 hours to 8 monthsthey tend to sit in their offices silently thinking about the perfect solution and then it takes several kicks to make them realize a couple weeks have passed without them saying a word about whats going onso it was kinda naive to hope there would be a timely update on the progress about this urgent player inputat work i cannot always explain every little detail and sometimes i dont even have all the information myselfbut i can always give a summary about what happened and whether i think were making progress or were falling behind scheduleit appears the second category is completely unknown to ccp

i pay with plex and i see it every time it starts at 10 days left and if you dont check your account once every 11 days then no message is going to save you because you dont log on anywayswell with recurring subscriptions i dont see why it should tell you especially because technically your account is not running out of time i pay for lots of online services and it works exactly like eveonline if i set it to not bug me and automatically bill me then that is what it does you really need to take some responsibility for yourself here buy a calendar program your phone or computer to remind you just remember it or set it up on an account that is not always broke it is really not that difficult
sometimes its bugged for some characters iv seen it twice in 56 months and i have 2 accounts to pay for so about 1012 months p
although i never wanted to do something like this it is time to show ccp that their user base may start to falter if they do not take the need to bugfix seriously if we take away the one thing that they have always been able to brag about which is their constantly growing userbase then maybe they will finally understand that keeping their userbase is just as important as adding shiny new things i would never want to quit a game i have come to love this much but their complete ignorance to bugfixing not just speeding up the game but fixing the broken parts of the game and showing that all major fixes will not be attended to for 18 months is just plain sada few issues that have been ignored just to remind you  rockets  user interface  factional warfare  etci propose a 2 month mass break from eve to start around the month of october

proposal reinstate the ability to target missilestorpedoes this is space if i can click on it i should be able to target it watch it and arguably warp to thembookmark them but i dont require that as ccp may have nerfed that for whatever reason they do that the absolute minimum goal is regaining the ability to target enemy missiles in space my ship should be able to target them and if i so choose do so and maybe even try shooting them down without equipping and firing crappy defender missiles also i enjoy clicking on them and watching them fly to and fro their targets every now and then it should be possible to allow targeting of enemy missiles at least and that doesnt mess with being able to bookmarkwarp to them

there are warnings for less dangerous actions why not this

i place all my extractors arund the same spot like this and i have no problems with depleation runing 23h
if they add this feature i will hug someone
this is a restating of my proposal after having at length considered the formatting of most other proposals and reading the stickied thread at the top of the forum i wish to see a save regional market to file button in the market window there is already the option to save an individual items listing to a file and these files are used to update various sites that track the marketmany people however myself included dont wish to update these market trackers because if they show where theyre making a profit and what theyre making it with their market will be flooded i understand this corporate piracy capitalism and all out piracy in general seems to be the point of this game i like thatin real life i would write a program to parse all of the daily information about the stock market for each region of the world for tracking so that i could see where i would earn the most for my sales and i would not share it with every other marketing company on the planet that would be counterproductive it would be sacrificing the edge i have over my competitionthere is an in game market tracking graph but it makes no sense to me numbers do knowing what i can buy in one specific system and where i can make the greatest profit is the name of the game its how you get ahead in evei would like a button that would save the entire regional market to a file no matter how big that file is so that i can parse the entire file to a spreadsheet or databasefollowing the acquisition of such a regional file i can write a program which i will make available to the public that will allow large scale market tracking for entire regions to be performed in a quick and simple way i will not share the data each user will have to save the file themselves to be imported into the programi feel that this would be useful as it would allow each player to keep a searchable list of buy and sell orders and general market values for their own use rather than relying on other people to be charitable in sharing their information which the best marketing tycoons know never to do
you noticed the little button on the bottom of the market windowthat allows you to export the market log for the item in that regionyou can then go and do what ever you want with that logso no screenshots no manual writing down neededand those online market tracker like evecentral or evemetrics rely on users uploading logsso when you upload your logs to them they will be more accurate aswellhthps i am quite sure that the market discussion subforum or eve technology lab subforum already have tools to make nice graphsstatistics from those market logs
i appreciate your input but youre missing my pointi dont wish to help the player base as a whole track the markets im in if i can make a 60m isk profit picking an item up in jita and dragging it somewhere else thats great if i tell everybody about it then my market gets flooded and i cant make a profit any more and thats not so greatim a capitalist im not sharingyes there is a button that allows me to save an individual items regional listings to a file which i can then write a piece of software to parse for myself i then have to do that for 90 million other items one by one i would also have to create a database item ids and another database for every system in each region i wished to collect data on just so that i could view it in an organized fashion unless ccp decided to give me those id databases or i could get them from eve central this could very well take me the better part of my natural lifethen i have to write a program to associate each of those ids with a name and drop them into a spreadsheet for private trackingi would like ccp to help me simplify this process i am fully willing to make the program itself open source when im finished but im definitely not sharing my data as i said im a capitalist
i still remeaber this lol welcome to eveif you must solo can mine the best thing you can do is try to find a low pop system out of the way some were that few people pass thoughand then you will still get can fliped just less often
noone reads the comments sections of the blogs anymore 
what did space end subscription do to you
sure but it will be 18 months with any dominion feature change then no bug solvingthey will incarna dust but not solve eve space 18 months of bug resolution freezedominion bugs still waiting a solution since 8 months 
this concern is simply unfounded any time you give players a lump sum of skill points it will benefit newer players more than older players the gap between older and newer players is always decreased when this happens you are not the only one who trained allot of learning skills when you started so you will not be the only new player who will have the opportunity to dump those sp into different areas that sp dump wont mean that much to a player who has years of training behind him
i personally agree with you cearain but in light of the controversial nature of the proposal and the close vote i felt it was important to amend the proposal to reflect the concerns of the csms who were opposed as you will see from the minutes i proposed doing this after the vote
will be interesting to see if this gets done and what is in it fixing lag is only 1 element of a very big picture the amount of promised changes for small elements rockets afs for example should be a solid focus point as much as giving me a ty incarna mini game that i will never use a minimum of 18 months that is before they will even look into the issues let alone develop fixes or roll out changes it is a shame that such a large portion of the game will not see any love for 2 yearsso these issues will be looked at in 18 months along with everything not related to walking in stationsoverall very much a let down pi brought a new set of industry which is no fun and anything but exciting how they will make people fight over such pitiful planet side income is certainly a mystery
that is probably a mistake i have a query in to ccp to find out what the real status is
thanks for the response

yes please this would improve immersion
very good ideain my opinion it could be useful to have 2 settings for the velocity vectors absolute mode and relative mode the first one shows the absolute speed of the ships respect to space the usual velocity and the other other setting shows the vector difference between their velocity and yours in relative mode the lenght of the arrow should be equal to the distance that the ship covers in 1 second and thus it should be zoom dependent some reasons to have this second setting toothis would really help to visualize transversal velocity and tracking issuesthis would make more immediate to understand variations of the relative distance between you and your target imagine you are orbiting someone tackling him and he turns on his overloaded mwd to get in rangein general there should be the option to chose between having the screen lenght of the arrows zoom dependent or not in the first case it may help in assessing travel times transversal speeds tracking issues while the second will help understanding where a ship is aligning to
nice idea the two vectors may be shown together the transversal isnt anything but the projection of the speed to the plane that is perpendicular to the distance vector and on which the other ship lies so the two vectors would form the two sides of a triangle which would make it easier to assess the speeds in 3dof course it would also double the clutter so its to be considered maybe options for the two and the user decides is best i would always keep them both on in small gangs id switch to the non small gang tab otherwise
guess i need to keep bumping it untill it get fixed
andreus thank you for your questions i would start by drawing a distinction between game play issues and role play issues to my mind the game play issues are generally more important but i do agree having a good role play backdrop makes the game much better alliance tournament is an example of good game play but poor role play it involves fun battles but its entirely contrived with made up rules rvb would be another example of good game play but poor role play the fights can often be evenly matched but why are they fighting eachother i think the proposal would make for the best game play in eve but let me also address your role play questions because i think that is very important tooi numbered your questions requesting what i consider role play explanations i will give you your answers by numberq1 why were these tactical sites built in deep space rather than in proximity to important things like moons planets stargates or stationsq2 why do the beacons need a capsuleer to secure themq3 what does securing them actually do and why does a capsuleer orbiting one for an entirely arbitrary length of time make it somehow impossible for a capsuleer on the same side to do exactly the same thinga13 this isnt explained but as anyone who has studied history knows there are reasons why some troops need to be in certain places at certain times its often better to have 100 men in a key place and time than 1000 men to late or misplaced would this be the same for space battles i would imagine so how would it work well i think we can only guess but these plexes are apparently the places where some military presence must be at a certain time i often imagine that what i am doing when i do a plex is giving a show of force i fly for amarr so i imagine that when a system goes contested that means that in that solar system there is unrest and support for the competing faction if i show up in an offensive plex my presence somehow makes it easier for the rebels to do some act which will further promote the amarr empire in that system whether that is scare off some sort of minmatar leader who was planning on crushing the rebellion or somehow supplying support for a ground based attack that the amarr want to work is a plex some sort of important power generator that helps direct power to the entire solar system i dont know i guess the thing is it is clear that in almost all real wars so far there have been lynchpins  these lynchpins are places that would often seem otherwise unimportant but in the war for whatever reason they are important hence the concept of making sure we have troops in certain areas for certain amounts of time is definitely well founded by real world warfare i agree ccp could do a bit more back story to spell it out more but in the mean time a bit of imagination can fill that in why are they size limited i think this can be explained many ways 1 way would be direct orders that your militia said you are not to commit too many resources to this plex so you can only commit frigates to that plex etc i admit this doesnt explain why nonmilitia cant enter the plex with bigger ships but maybe its because when pirates come in they are pretending to be in one or the other militias in order to get through the gate hence they need to be in the right ship its not really explained but it could be explained in a decent way the ship restrictions on plexes are just too damn nice for game play reasons to give up due to a lack of imagination on the role play front continued next post
q4 why in a plex being contested by an enemy dont all the reinforcement waves just warp in at once and kill him why dont reinforcement waves warp in to back up a friendly capsuleer under attacka4 i dont know but my proposal does away with npcs and therefore this issue so to the extent this is troubling to you should support my proposal q5why does a defensive plex being revealed by a friendly capsuleer cause it to show up in locala5 i agree i think the plexes are well known to be hot spots or lynch pins by both sides and should at the very least be displayed on the overview of everyone in faction war the idea that you have to probe out what is a hot spot or lynchpin is silly especially when there are npcs already there but even with out them there both sides should have the intel and be able to inform their army where they need to go fight the generals in the empire shouldnt just be like ok troops go on out there wherever and try to find someplace important to fight for every pilot would have these important points programmed into their overview of their ship and updated automatically by the command structure q6 why are you not given rewards for running plexes in uncontested systems when securing these plexes ensures that they will not be attacked by the enemya6 im not sure i agree that if you secure anything you should get some reward but that is truly beside the point of my post i am trying to make plexing into something that would require pvp skill and be fun how much or when to reward it is a separate issueq7 why are capsuleers from an allied militia fired on but someone clearly capturing the plex is not as long as they have positive standings with the faction the plex belongs toa7 i agree thats silly my proposal ends this there would be no npcs so the players would be the ones taking and defending the plexes i dont think the players will refuse to fight war targets because they have a high standing with the militiaq8 why are plexes not brought online where theyre needed ie deeply contested systems rather than in a completely random distribution why are capsuleers given loyalty points for killing each other  destroying entirely replacable assets with other entirely replacable assets  but not for capturing plexesa8 well again i look at plexes similar to hot spots and lynch pins of wars not everyimportant battle occurs at a seemingly important place why did major battles occur in the places they did well there are reasons of course but those reasons are often well beyond the cursory backstory we have in eve what are the major trade routes for the populations in all these solar systems which planets are most important in each solar system from an agricultural industrial or political view i mean we know almost none of the very basic information on these solar systems let alone the very nuanced information as to why a certain place might need troops more than another im not sure what you mean by entirely replaceable assets i suppose anything that can be rebuilt is entirely replaceable what do you mean q9 would any of the factions entrust immediate and vital matters of national security to capsuleers who almost why never do anything thats not either profitable fun or botha9 i see capsuleers different than you i think we are the best of the best one capsuleer is worth 1000 npcs the armies are thrilled to have us on board

this is an old thread posted before apoc 15 and the rig changes now destroyers can fit 3 cheap small rigs they get more of a boost from this  increase than t1 frigates because they started out with better stats they get more of a boost from this than tech 2 frigs because tech 2 frigs only has 2 rig slots the high alpha of destroyers make them extremely dangerous for all frigates going from memory i think a thrasher can do about like 240 dps that may include overheat not sure and have about 7k ehp with its tracking bonus its hard to say how this doesnt destroy properly destroy frigates those small guns are doing close to full damage the hull is essentially the same cost as a t1 frigate so why would anyone ever fly a t1 frig if the signature of destroyers is reduced boosting destroyers even further just makes t1 frigates one of the funnest ships in the game obsoletein low sec i see plenty of destroyers i dont see any need for a general boost that said i do think a coercer should have 2 mids

seconded  eve is all about consequences there seems to be a whole industry of scammers trying to avoid them why make it easier for them also if you cant live with your own invention then put your misnamed toon in the character bazarr and get another one most people will decide their toons name is awful long before they have too many skills to scrap and make another one anyway
having lived in both preapocrypha prov and postdominion drone space old prov was by far the better moneymakerall bounty regions in eve have been boosted with more rats and access to highend minsdrone space a crap region to begin with had min yields nerfed and the highend min market was flooded as a result of grav upgrades on top of that plus no faction spawns or drops grav or radar spawns it isnt that much to ask that a nullsec region be capable of generating more profit than missioning in empire

i would like to propose a change be made to the existing fleet chat interfacecan fleet chat channels be modified to include the same settings capabilities as regular channels so the fcwc andor boss can create a message that shows up when a new member joinsthis would greatly reduce a lot of unnecessary use of both voice and typed messages repeatedly asking questions such as what shiptypes and general maintenance questions that are asked each and every time someone joins a chat channeljust a suggestion i think it may prove beneficialrothgr bronnroyal order of security specialists
would be so nice to join fleet and read ship type bc down looking for ewar location system x at gatestation y
they added this ingenious system into that fleetfinder doohicky a couple of patches back that allows you to put in a decription most smart people add that stuff there and then when new people ask them they just say stfu read the fleet description you worthless carebear
i would like to propose that if you info on any ship you see in the overview  or info any ship in your fleet or your own ship you would be able to see the signature id that would be given to someone combat scanning youwhyit would be nicer to be able to ignore your corps  fleets signatures right off the bat and search for ships that are not yoursanother chagne i would like to propose is signature time from the moment you start scanning a signature alive time would start on every signature if you recall your probes and reissue them the timer continues that way you can track the older ships in the system versus the young ones the new ones jumping in vs the ones hiding in the system whyat time of war  it is very hard to scan down a ship with combat scanners when there are constantly new ships jumping into the system and out of one but if you have patients then you will star to see the older signatures in the system
i was about to sayive never tried bombing a gate but i have tried bombing a wh entrance and you get an error message of the bomb aoe reaches the wh itself so when your reach is 5km you have to park yourself precisely 5km away from the wh before you can start firing and then youre only covering a portion of the wh with plenty of real estate for traffic to come and go unabated
nowadays you cant activate smartbomb if the gate or station is in range sometime back you could also in lowsec you could meet smartbombing motherships that couldnt be tackledheavy interdictors didnt existso its much better now stop whining
a bit long winded but my two centsthe long eve releasesthe shortproposed suggestion ccp should have three release per year if possible one revenue generator one user request and one technical each of these has a different focus and will require different voices to have authority over the release it all about balancerevenue release usually stem from folks looking to make more profit for a company ceos cios vps accountants bean counters you guys are important and nesscary but i am a little jadeduser releases are those request of new features functionality and fixes requested by the people who directlyindirectly effect the flow of cash coming into a company or section of a companytechnical release come from the grunts architects  developers who gave their blood and sweat to form this mystical thing users wantnote task for the release need to be specific below are examplesfix pi is not detailed enough improve the user interface of planetary interaction system to increase usability by presenting routed  unrouted goods in a onscreen visual method without requiring an individual to click on every extractor individual is a lot more detail and something that can actually be workedfix lag again is way to vague improve the response time in client to server transaction to enable a more fluid game play is a little more detailed this can be accomplished through network performancef5s hardware backbone setup to support large bandwidth of incoming and outgoing data decreasing the amount of data required to be sent in transactions or minimize the overhead needed for network handshaking
you want expansions to be created by accountants bean counters and architectshow can an expansion be a revenue generator when they do not charge money for itthey only fix playerrequested bugs once per yearall you show is a profound ignorance of how any business works let alone ccp heres a hint focusing all of your workers towards one specific task at a time is a recipe for disaster changing ccps entire release structure is no simple thing you come across as shockingly arrogant and unintelligent

i think you might be misreading that item n3 probably means that being docked causes you to be seen but that you might not necessarily see others
why the heck would you view that as a useful abilityseriously did you even take the time to think about itby the time you lock on to a missiletorpedo your too lateand you got many more headed your wayim sorry but this idea is just failnot supportingid rather waste my ammo on killing the source anywayps buff defenders or come up with a point defense system but not that
that is one aspect of it and not the only reason if that is all you see it as you should reread my postit isnt about being effective in combat it is about something that was allegedly removed for creativity which i think wasnt a valid reason to do it but if people are whiney about it i dont see warpingbookmarking your missiles as a necessity so dont let them do it but why kill something when it isnt required to do what you want you want to kill that fly in your house do you burn down your house do you smash it with a hammer putting a hole in your walltvetc no you use the appropriate response to deal with ithere they killed something when all they needed to do was modify it
what does being in space have to do with being able to target anything and everything this is earth if i can put it in my mouth i should be able to swallow it both of these statements use the same logici honestly dont see any valid point to this idea and i think it would be a waste of time unfortunately not supported
one aspect i alluded to severalbut ok manwhatever floats your boathow the hell is it considered creative to be able to target something designed to fly at a high rate of speed and impact before anyone gets the chance to react the only missile youd have half a chance of taking out is a cruise missile and people hardly use them in pvp for obvious reasons making this idea clearly foolish to be sureagain what the heck usefulness is it to bookmark a missile think about this your typical missile is going to be within 100km of your ship is it really going to be that helpful this is truly reaching at best are you even thinking of the same kind of equipment or something elseno im going to nuke the other house thats shooting said flies at me with near impunity and total destruction how or why you would say what you say is completely off the wall and certainly making everyone question your sanityprobially because its a complete waste of time and no ones going to use itagainif you had read my post before you decided to troll me youd got a nice little hint of a even better ideaits called point defense system makes defenders look like specks of sand in comparison

not supported i would only support the highsec part if autopilot warped to zero high security space is called that for a reason its relatively secure i dont have a problem with afk people if someone walks away for 10 minutes to make themselves some tasty dinner during a 40jump journey and sets their ship on autopilot why should they be a free kill if theyre jumping in 0510 security systemsthe part about lowsec enter at your own risk i dont think concord should be able to protect anyone there regardless of how long it takes them to arrive

hellojust to knoware csm making alone the meeting minutes or ccp want to see the content and adapt it to be marketingly in line prior publication cheersyeay
the regular biweekly minutes are created and edited by csm without ccp inputthe most recent summit minutes were originally created by ccp edited and expanded by csm and then reviewed and released with minor edits by ccp however the final draft was not as broadly distributed within ccp for comment as some in retrospect would have liked
low sec is fine stop trying to improve it and lets be honest the only way to get carebears into low sec is by turning it into high sec nothing else will do
so in essence you would have a vector which is always of the same length so it goes smaller as you zoom out or a vector that grows relative to zoom level so it stays the same size as you zoom out of these two the vector that doesnt change its relative size would be more useful even if it might vanish when you zoom out far enoughactual math for the vector isnt even needed to be done on the server side as the client can easily draw it from the information that the server has already sent to your ovso this change would require very littlenothing to be changed from the server side and some tweaking from the clients side
my idea features a vector that is always the same length disregarding the zoom level this has two advantages you can see the vectors also when zoomed out so you can follow the general situation and drive your ship where you want if you change the zoom a little the vector wont change so your assessment of the real speed based on the vector you see should be betterabout lag yep all calculations should be client based no lag idea ftw

because of you i googled the word futanariand do not wantfor those of you interested
how the hell do you play a game like eve and not know what futa is do you even read the chronicles at all or do you just play the game with no idea what the backstory is
i im not sure what to saythe perverse side of me wants to say yes not just because of my anticensoring ethos but because it would probably do alot to keep the instation population in check hypothetical situationcorp ceo were being camped in by war targets guys what do we want to docorpmate 1 we could walk around the station and wait them outcorpmate 2 wait dont the strippers have scricket noisescorp ceo right everyone get into a ship were undocking in 2 minuteshypothetical situationon the other hand i realize that there are many prudes in the world and many of them are involved in governmentpolitics ccp would get a lot of crap from the censors about this sort of contentsupport pending
i apreciate your thaught out post keep in mind not all the female strippers would have both between their legsjust the ones specifically labeled as futanari this is canon with gallente culture gallente are very liberal and tolerant of eroticism and various lifestyles and fetishes amarr are the opposite so if you were in an amarr stations you defiantly would never see a stripper of any kind because if incarna is holds true to the storyline amarians see nudity in public as a sign of serious deviancy and a grave sin i am not saying the gallente are kinky i am just saying that out of all the races they are the single most tolerent of different cultures and lifestyles it even says that when you go to make a new pilot the one fetish that is most mainstream in gallente is the concept of futanari or transgenderism cross dressing and other form of defying typical gender roles and stereotypes are prevalent in gallente culture the main reason i made this thread was because i could realistically see futa in station being completely ordinary and the norm in gallente stations
there are 3 other t1 ships in that class and a cormorant needs either an implant or a rig to fit t2 150mm rails if you are using the low slot for a magstab im not really sure what awesome dps you are talking about the cormorant with t2 rails does with maxed skills 136 dps with 1 weapon rig at 25km with cn antimatter even then you need to 2 ancillary current routers to make it happen in long range sniper mode its optimal is 90km 11 falloff and does an amazing 79 dps you might as well be tickling the enemy to deathblaster cormorants are pretty much fail since even with null a frig can still be in point range and recieve no damage from a cormorant no matter what you use in the low and mid slots not to mention that with the hybrid rig you dont have the pg for a speed mod so a frig can either kite you or disengage at will
i agree the corm isnt great but since many frigs in low sec have an ab a corm with a mwd and rails can be quite effective at killing them cormorant new setup 1magnetic field stabilizer iicatalyzed coldgas i arcjet thrustersmedium shield extender iifaint warp disruptor ix5 prototype i engine enervator125mm prototype i gauss gun caldari navy antimatter charge s125mm prototype i gauss gun caldari navy antimatter charge s125mm prototype i gauss gun caldari navy antimatter charge s125mm prototype i gauss gun caldari navy antimatter charge sempty high slot125mm prototype i gauss gun caldari navy antimatter charge s125mm prototype i gauss gun caldari navy antimatter charge s125mm prototype i gauss gun caldari navy antimatter charge ssmall ancillary current router ismall ancillary current router ismall ancillary current router ithis ship will go 1500ms overheat over 2098 140 dps with 15k optimal and 6k falloff 165 dps overheated and has 5k ehp yes if you can drop a scram on it then its dead but thats true of any kiter and this is one of the weakest destroyers but the catalyst and thrasher are good and the coercer would be very good also if given a midslot if the proposal was to do that i would support it but again when combined with a decent tackler the coercer can really spit out dps but whatever 50 of the ships in the class are quite good thrasher is bordering on op imo there are 16 t1 frigs only about 30 are good there are 8 t2 frigates 3 are good there are 8 interceptors 4 are good there are 4 faction frigates and 2 are good there are 4 pirate frigates and only one is good  but here is the most important thing of all these ships you will see just as many thrashers out in low sec as any other frigate class ships except drams and rifters destroyers are very common and very useful they certainly do not need a boost you would see more catalysts if it werent for all the thrashers the thrashers are borderline oped so why bother with a catalyst instead of a boost destroyers at most we really just need a thread to give coercers a second mid and possibly some more fitting room for the corm but even there i dont see any urgency that every ship in eve be perfectly equal t1 destroyers really do a good job destroying t1 frigates i dont think anyone denies that after the rig changes distancing them even further from the already hurting t1 and t2 frigates just doesnt make sense

my destroyer i use it only to salvage 
signedall destroyers should have at least 2 med slots 1 mwd 1 scramthere is no point to call a ship frigate killer when it cant point it and no they are not supposed to 1shot frigates nor all should fly arty thrashers
i do 90 of my exploration in low sec mag sites suck in low sec compared to any other site you may want to actually read my post before making yourself look ignorant i get more salvage from 110 training site in high sec than i do in a low sec mag site now go read my opening post again and see what the complaint is its that they do not balance with the other types of sites all other types of sites scale appropriately with whats expected if you still dont understand that then your comments are useless to the discussion
i can vouch for worm hole mag sites being worthwhile and high sec really badits possible to solo class 1  3 worm holes without needing a team
if this is a disguised attempt to shift value available in nullsec to highsec then not supportedrisk v reward chaps if you want good magnetometric sites go somewhere risky
risk vs reward isnt the only formula theres also time invested and currently time invested into scanning down mag sites in high sec is absolutely worthless youre better off doing any number of other high sec activities this isnt a high vs null sec issue this is simply a high sec balancing issue and its a no brainer of course null sec sites should be more valuable but that doesnt mean the high sec ones should be worthless
noticed this was not on the listwhat happened to representing lowsec improvements mynxeei feel my vote was wasted
i agree i feel that lowsec has basically been abandoned even with a csm member who supposedly supports lowsec my vote was clearly misplacedeven though this has been ver widely supported and is the most comprehensive post for lowsec improvement it didnt even make it to a meeting it seemsi wont bother to update this thread if anyone else wants to bother with what seems to be a hopeless cause feel freerico

not supportedim quite happy for stupid people to contribute to ccps wealth makes things cheaper for the rest of us
even sending half of that money would be a positive pr exercise i mean itd certainly do ccp more good than hiring a pr company did them i think you got scammed there imho ccp
while i support the sentiment the red cross would not be my organization of choice upon further research it looks like red cross has turned into one of those bloated institutions with ridiculous overhead costs they have wide mindshare which is good for pr and is what keeps them so large not saying that they dont do good but i think there are probably better organizations out there for your charity dollar
i support this idea
not supportedif you want to do something for charity then manor woman up and donate your own time or money stop nagging other people or businesses to do it for you because youre too busy playing video games or just too lazy or stingy to help out yourself
i am not sure if this is been proposed to the csm yet or even in this matter corporate roles that relate to pos functions and access should be streamlined a bit further the problem we face now is that granting the necessary roles to research or use production lines at a pos are the same roles that one would need to highjack corporate structures and steal from corporate hangars my proposal is to streamline a few of the corporate roles possibly add a few that would make it simpler for granting roles to use pos services at the same time preventing theft an example of the problema corporate has a new member who has not yet vested enough time to be trusted with control over assets but this member has some bpos they want to research  a set of roles should be added that would allow that member access to the research slots at one of the labs without having the ability to offline and unanchore structures and not having access to withdraw funds from corporate wallets if the corporate in question does not apply rent fees to the slots then there really should be no need for wallet permissions to begin with imho same example would apply to any pos related services from bp research to assembly line production since researching and production may require components of some type be it data sheets to materials i think there should be a way for the new corp mate to be able to add the necessary items to the arrays without taking something they didnt add or create from use of the array the idea would be to make it so that almost every member of a corporate could use services but allowing corp ceodirectors to be able to control the finer details of corporate asset rights so that new members can use certain services without stealing and so that vested members can have more elaborate access and yet preventing theft of higher level access as well hangar access on its own is a fine example ceo and directors can directly control how each member can access hangars but when it comes to using corporate structures the access control is not so versatile
supported corporate permission system is severely lacking at the momentanother idea to add make onlineoffline access configurable per structure like view and take access is this allows to delegate people to maintain moon miningreactions which needs onliningofflining silos without them being able to offline the entire tower

tldr change t2 bpo from unlimited runs to 1000 so they eventually phase out of the gamecurrently owners of t2 bpos control the t2 market inventors have no change of competing with them due to a poor design by ccp on introducing t2 what was done is donemy main is heavy into invention and i own some t2 bpos after a lot of research on invention vs the t2 bpos it all comes down to the equivalent of the t2 bpos being nothing but an isk printing press invention has many gambles and risk compared to the t2 bpo having absolutely zero at all sure as an owner i would be greatly upset by losing my printing press but it is for the bestmy proposal is that all t2 bpos be changed from unlimited runs to 1000 runs this puts an expiration date on them but still gives them great value for nowyes i know that the module bpos would run out first but they are not as valuable as the ship bpos which rightfully so should be the way of thingsus t2 bpo owners have been able to have our cake and eat it too for long enough it is time to fix this broken mechanicalso for those of you saying that inventing can easily compete with t2 bpo owners are lying your ass off hard core and you know it so stop the bull
issue oh god not this  again
yes this again mr i know everything there is about this game so please just echo whatever i write so i feel like some leet god amongst the rest of you pathetic playerswell its what you sound like to be honest anyways it is for the best of the game not for the best for a t2 bpo ownerjust try to thing about what is best for the game and not is what is best for just you for a change
no i dont know it invention is pretty profitable in most items and for the other items dont invent them thenalso changing them to 1000 run bpcs will suck for drones and still last forever for battleships your proposal sucksyes i do inventionedit and i can easily make 50 profit on the items i invent i see nothing wrong herestop poasting
50 ehh bpo owners make 100 profit because they invest zero isk into having something to make the t2 itemthere are a ton of items that no one bothers to invent because it is not worth it why invest into an item when you will always and i mean always be easily undercut by a t2 bpo ownerccp introduced invention because the t2 bpo lottery was fail it is time they finished the job as an experienced inventor and holder of several t2 bpos ranging from ammo to modules to ships i know for a fact it is time to get rid of them
please visit your user settings to reenable images
yea 50 and if some are unprofitable then dont invent them there are plenty of other things to invent its really that simpleid also say a good number of bpo owners also bought their bpos which means they dont actually see a profit for more than a couple years yea the original holders are making 100 profit but i really dont care

i dont own any t2 bpos when i first started it seemed crappy that some players getgot to have them free but guess what many players got nothing and even more players sold their t2 bpos to other players for billionsmillions it isnt fair i dont have multiple billions or trillions of isk please convert all billions to millions and trillions to billions to make it fair while we are at it i dont have a hundred million sp lets take away half of all characters with 50million sp or more to make it fair i cant compete with their sp totals also for you saying that all t2 bpos uber pwn invention is you lying your ass off hard core and you know it so stop the bull troll

proposing removal of parts of the gameplay that you personally dont like is selfish
the suggestion is not to make a change in the process of how development life cycle is handled nor who does the actual workwith any business there is someone who makes the decisions on what work is considered important having the focus of each release shift from area to area allows the company to focus in on different aspects without neglecting one or always throwing it under the rug generally the front line grunt developers dont have large say on how the work is prioritized usually the business backgrounded leadership is and wont put much emphasizes on fixing bugs and issue unless it effects the roithe major point of the proposal was to have three releases each with a different focus having focus for a release doesnt mean you neglected everything else and are so tunnel visioned you cant see the car going to hit you from the left each release should have a general focus of what the majority of the development organization should be working on as with sustaining any production system you have keep up on in each of the 4 areas i mentioned in the other forum postin a release you would pick 13 major statement of work items that are inline with the focus and then pick items from the other groups day to day production operations have to be done to keep a system goinglet me explain the three groups in more detailrevenue generators  these are things that bring in more money into the company a prime example of this in ccp is dust this is a new branch of the companys product line and brings in more revenuenote this would not be considered a release its just an example of a revenue generator incarna is another example it has new features and functionality added to the game to expand the product in hopes of bringing in more users more user mean  more subscriptions which means more money hence the release generates new revenue more so that sustaining what already existsuser release  these are release where ccp works on items that directly and indirectly relate to the commentsrequest of individuals that use their products this does not mean ccp will meet every request or implement it the way every user wants it donetechnical release  hardware software performance tuning release this focuses on giving the developers time to fix bugs time to reorganize processes to remove manually labor intensive efforts a breather to upgrade servers change out network hardware it can take a lot of time and coordination to complete these efforts forcing this to always be done in the background or while managing other release is not always possiblechange doesnt happen immediately and the large the company is the longer it usually takes
i dont think you are in position to ask for this you are not major ccp shareholder to decide how expansions are going to be developeddistributedplay the game or leave simple
sound idea
fu eve hater 
just about the most lucrative thing you can do in eve is to be trusted to run a large corp then steal everything kartoon got away with an estimated 18 trillion isk in assets and cashadding real world value and presumably real world litigation to eve would dramatically change the game i doubt anyone really wants class actions and lawyers to dominate gameplayif you dont agree ill sue you for mental cruelty and aggravated damages

hi thereas ive seen on your agenda you have this topic on the wishlist for quite a while and it might actuany be a tacttical suggestion to use this option to get fleet battles to jump to a reinforced nodethe suggestion i have is pritty simple one already can dock ships in capital hanger arrays so that does not need to change but what one can not do is jump along with the capital as a pod pilot to go there where the fun is happening yet this can change if you give pods and yes only pods the option to link to a capital when they are within 25 km range just like you do with a titan to jump along the same way as a carrier or mothership sorry dont like the new name to the destination system doing this also creates a more pointed option to where fleet battles will take place you even have the option to stall the capital warpin move it to a reinforced node when you catch to many ships move onto one system this way the cynos and ships will be in one 2 or 3 fleets and if you give fcs the option to connect their fleets in a way to show you they work on the same battlefielf you can kinda predict what is happening before your node goes down underthe rest i leave up to you
i was thinking about settings different keep at range and orbit distance and execute them with a shortcut even if there is already a menu that propose different ranges i never find my optimal through iti also noticed than orbit trajectory is quite random and i was thinkg about the possibility to define them it would be just after clicking of the orbit button youll see a curve to direct or something like this i think it could add a kind of gameplay while in several target engagements
 and there was much rejoicing
thats not what being a sandbox means its not about catering to all play styles where did you get that idea its about giving players the tools to freely interact with one another and to shape the game world they play in as opposed to be guided down a predetermined path and essentially be taken on a ride like in a themepark
so why people should be guided down the pat you likeat the end it is the same thing you want the toll used to follow others path to be nerfed and your kind of tools boosted

i currently believe that learning skills are almost a waste of time while they do make it much better to learn i do not like having to spend time learning skills so that i can learn faster then there is the issue of the tier 2 learning skills these are not worth it to train unless you have a more than 1 year skill plan my idea we get rid of skill points and just give everyone 10 to all stats then turn around and give people back the skill points they spent on their learning skills for most people this will be about 2 million skill points in which they can reallocate into whatever they want for those who took the time to get all to level 5 this will be 6 million skill points to reallocate for those with the skills already trained this will not be a game breaking change that will suddenly make bad people good unless of course you have an 8 mil sp character with 6 mil in skill points it also will improve the playerbase as a whole for newer players this will allow people to allocate their 100 bonus better and will allow them to get into ships faster increasing player retention thoughts
the csm has addressed this issue see this wiki article for the details

the process we used was to take the player prioritization split it up into small medium and large issues and then filter those sublists in order to make the final list at least one csm of those present at the meeting had to give it a thumbsup and items that got multiple thumbsup floated up a bitthat particular proposal did not get any thumbsups you should not infer from this that csm thinks it is a bad idea we did some serious pruningwe specifically published all the intermediate results so that ccp could see what the raw player sentiment was also we are working hard to make it very clear to everyone in ccp that if they are thinking of doing something they should check the csm backlog to see if there is anything related to it and drop us a line if that is the case

helloi am not sure if this is been proposed to the csm yet but it would not be unlikely is well known for the most of you that the system used for mining in eve is one of the easiest things to do in the game also boring but profitable you just need to use a ship with the proper fit jump to a belt of asteroids or ice turn your lasers on and wait for it to fill your cargo then carry to the station or transfer to a can or to another ship with more capacityalthough there are several ways to do this depending on the ships and methods the mechanism remains very similar is so easy that there are programs created specifically to mine just by turn on the computer which violates the eula as far as i remembermuch has been spoken about the problem of macrominers and macroratting but there has been no effective action against this matter and im not to discuss who is to blame in this respect my interest is directed towards a possible solutionmy proposal is based on1the change of name of the asteroid belts and ice belts to fields as the belts are not circling anything at least in the strict sense of the word2 the change of name is consistent with the way that would have the new fields not in a linear fashion if not in a spherical form it makes the miners have to move between the asteroids or do more bookmarks in order to mine them what would make the profession of mining more active with the environment rather than just jump to a single bookmark3 move all the belts of ore and ice in highsec lowsec and 00 to locations reachable only via exploration system probes which i think would make impossible for a macro to reach these locations this forces the miners and rat killers to be present in the mining and ratting processshould not take more than lv4 on the skills of exploration to find an asteroid field4 that asteroids do not lower their respawn a few days to always keep the same base respawn after dt5 a warning system to indicate the low amount of mineral in an asteroid that is minedless than 1000 unitspros the profession is a bit more attractive less boring but just as profitable to be less boring perhaps more people want to mine without using macros move asteroids to sites of exploration will remove the macros miners  ratting two for the price of onewe have really a real market for minerals which would lead to a real economyconsexploration skills add to the list of the mining profession although it would not be muchmany macros owners really angrythis is nothing new this is already done in wspace wormholes the mechanics just need to be moved to the rest of eve do not know if it would be difficult or easyin my opinion is a good option to convert mining in something more attractive and less boring besides solving a problem that takes a long time without solutionim not a programmer and not know if the macros can be adapted to this change but i dont think is possible or macros in wormholes would exist rightsorry if i made any grammar mistake english is not my native language
i like the idea to basically move all static belts to grav sites scanning like you said maybe leave a few static belts with only veld or something for the newbs5 though i dont agree with you can already do this if you have a survey scanner if you want to maximize your yield by not mining a rock with only 1 piece of ore left on a 3 minute cycle check the survey scannerin the end though the only way to stop bots would be to add a captcha when mining
i like the idea im a miner with little experience but the changes look good to methumb up
i think ccp announced planetary ring mining and other exciting stuff in some video i certainly wont find now but thats at least 17 months away so 
yea they were talking about actual belts around planets 100s of kms long a few years ago
hello tirani had this idea when i was in the csm and developed it a bit too in order to make this feasible barges and exhumers would need to be able to scan these fields down using the onboard scanner so as to prevent using one of their already limited highslotsthis otherwise seems like a good idea but the ice mining aspect could be enhanced further the idea i developed is visible under my overhaul of poses but could easily be implemented separate from that to enhance the concept of ice mining as it isif youre interested in reading about my concept feel free to click the link above however i do support this idea
yes please ccp will do thisin 18 months edit support
while i support the suggestion in my ideal world permission should be configurable on a person by person and module by module basis having access to a lab shouldnt grant access to all labs same for sma and corp hangars
there needs to be a new upgrade for sovernty to fully disallow any cyno of any kind currently even with a cyno jammer covert cynos still can be opened up in the system what is the point of a cyno jammer if people can still open a cynothe idea of a cyno jammer is to add protection from invaders and yet they still can easily bypass this with an all cyno jammer or covert cyno jammer module there would be a counter to this cowardly so called pvp it is just people who fail at normal pvp who are looking for easy ganks
thats the whole point you bloody noob for an idiotthere is no other way to break a cyno jammer blockade other than a covert cynousually people who can afford to install a cyno jammer better have a damn good defense fleetsounds like in your case you epically fail at that considering you love to lose freighters and mining equipment to stupid situations not surprisedplease for the love of all things good stfu

currently players can board ships in space and benefit from the fit rigs if they dont have the skill for it i propose that be changed if you dont have the skill for it then the rig should not work
working as intended as according to ccp anyway its a nonissue as the skills take a day anywayonce again youre a  stop poasting
ccp has never said that you are a terrible liar also it takes more than just one day to train for the t2 rigs again lying your ass off
ccp has said it i just cant be bothered to find the quote also to train skills from being able to fit tech 1 cccs to tech 2 cccs which is what i was basing my statement on is just jury rigging 4 ok i lied a day and a half for me 2 days max tech 2 purgers need shield rigging 4 which is 2 or 3 days anyway its inconsequential
how convenient for you
why wouldnt you want it to always take effect i type like this cause it makes me not look cool
how in the blithering hell is this so damn bad that it requires your epic failness to  about
i see i struck a nerve there yes people like you that abuse exploits like that will be upset you will simple have to adapt
it seems that you havent got a clue what you are talking about you have always been able to fly ships fitted with rigs without the skills but training the skills reduces the penalties that come with each rigso learn to read the penalties accrued with each rig type that is why you train the skill
the op is right we are sploiters of a mechanic that while it seems balanced because you get more penalties if you dont have the skill trained but its not balanced at all no no it is not for shame for shame we shall overcome we will simple must have adaptalso bold is the new cruise control for cool amirite
answer the question what makes it so bad that you feel its an exploitcleared out trolling remarks  adida
he wont because he cantalso hes a drooling idiot who vomits way too much trolling crap on this forum
isnt it about time that there was certain sectors of eve space that has special spacial features a bit like the 3rd part of the recon mission with the green gasseous space that damages shipswhat i would like to see is special spacial areas for miners and industrialists to be able to enter with purpose built shield modules that allows them to survive in specific areas and to make it interesting only allow the miners and industrialists to fit the special shield modules that stop damage from the spacial anomoliesjust to keep the pvpers happy this doesnt mean they cant go into the area just means they take constant damage when they do
sounds like a nerf to pvp with no actual reason or benefit
i dont see it as a nerf to pvp at all as i pvp in warships too i see it as a way of giving miners and industrialists a chance in pvp by making it slightly more dangerous for the warships and indeed miners and industrialists who dont mount the proper module for the area of space they are inright now in pvp in normal space miners and industrialists have practically no chance of surviving an encounter which makes miners and industrialists less likely to want to come out and play due to that fact
i would like to point out also pvp vs a miner and a industrialist ship isnt actually pvp as 9999 of the time they cant shoot back and dont really have proper effective tanks that last any length of timeso to me killing something that cant kill back isnt pvp its piracy
this calls for the battlebadger
actually such locations exist ive mined places like this in wspacethough having them around outside of wspace would be nice too
i want more dangerous situations in space like areas where your scanner wont work targeting is delayed due to natural phenomena targeting range is adversely effected due to the same emthermal damage from magnetic clouds or the like kinetic damage from actual asteroid fields some day in the future explosive damage from volatile gas pockets when weapons fire happens in them
id love to see the w space system anomolies come out to k space seems odd that no pulsars red giants black holes etc exist in the main eve cluster
i wouldnt mind taking a break from the grind already trained for hulk so got no 2 month skills sadly im a ceo if a good corp and cant take long breaks

also i propose that anyone that isnt a pvper is immune to all guns and damage of any type at all times guns are overpowered and should be nerfed also pvp should be banned it may be necessary to also remove weapon systems from npc rats as people may otherwise lose ships while pveing and to be frank that just isnt fair

tbh i quite like the csm a lot less when they start prefering business hats to purist hats onyes the learning skills are a pain to train so is gallente battleship lvl 5 no you dont need to train them the first 2 months of your eve career i honestly dont understand why anyone would do such a thing that being said i wouldnt mind if they were removed if it does not slow down my training speeds and i can reinvest the skill points i have in them instantly in whatever i like for an indefinate ammount of time like the free points we got recently due to the long down time
i personally think that learning skills are one of the biggest turn offs for new players and indeed those of us who indulge in training an alt you could argue that ccp have made the game too noob friendly with accelerated learning and two free remaps right off the bat back in my day you started with 40k sp and had to wt15 through 5 feet of snow etc etc if learning skills were removed and the sp added to a pool to redistribute then everyone winsolder players who have trained learning skills get a pool to spend on what they like and they have benefited over the years from the increased training times compared to some of their peersthose who havent trained learning skills to a reasonable level are now on a par with vets but with nothing to show for it otherwisenew players arent put off by the tedium of training learning skills for several weeks in total in order to get aheadyes this is a harsh universe where your choices may or may not have an otherwise unforseen knock on effect further down the line as a hardcore caldari mission runner i knew found to his dismay when he made his way into gallente space and not everyone is cut out for this game but through the sp reimbursement system ccp have an opportunity to get rid of perhaps the biggest bone of contention amongst new and old players alike
its not the same thing and you saying it is makes me inclined to believe you still dont understand what makes a sandbox mmorpgs different from a themepark mmorpgswhen i see players asking for missions or mining to be completely free from any possible negative impact from other players i interpret that as them asking for themepark type game play pvp free instanced completely controllable predictable outcomes that are almost always positive this isnt a legitimate play style to be supported in a mmorpg that claims to be both sandbox and pvp orientated worse yet the gains made by players doing this arent themselves instanced the isk minerals mods and other gains made have an impact on the game world as a wholeso in the simplest form what you want is to have your cake and eat it too you want to make gains that impact the the whole game world other players but object to the whole game world other players being able to impact the means of these gainsas long as this sort of game play exists low sec can never truly be fixed its a serious imbalance in the games dynamics which is why in my original suggestion i said all but newbie combat missions exploration and serious mining all need to be moved out of high sec
my peace was said in this threadi feel that my vote was wasted
xorv your distinction between sandbox and themepark mmos is well taken and i dont doubt there are some pilots looking for a themepark yet as i read the conversation between you and venkul i dont interpret him as advocating a themepark like you he too is discussing a sandbox but he is challenging your presupposition that pvp should be the dominant playstyle in the eve sandbox as venkul points out that is not everyones preferred cup of tea and some compelling justification must be offered for saying that it should be this reminds me of the debate over pvp fundamentalism i dont know if you are an acolyte of that or not and it would be interesting to hear your thoughts on the matter or perhaps a different clarification is in order i too would like to see a low sec buff as a matter of policy however it should not be at the expense of others who dont want to play there rather we need to find creative ways to draw not force more nonpirate folks into low sec while encouraging small fleet and small holder interactions delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
the only ones that could reply would be a ccp manager who has input into development and that wouldnt be smart of themif they say they listen thats not good enough for those that post here if they list priority changes and that list isnt complete theyll catch flack for it if they put a full list out  great they just bypassed the csms whove been asking after such a list for how long  which demonstrates just how little the csm are worth etceterain other words nothing a csm says here will suffice and if ccp posts  theyre in a pretty close to nowin situation itll either be not good enough denied as lies or ignoringbypassing the csmsif you want a real initiative  post in the suggestions forum requesting a list of csm changes to be collected and published by ccp  we provide you with feedback now tell us how much value weve added to the process get it on the books as an official players request vs csm postscript comment attached to meeting notes fulfillment of such a request would take absolutely no development effort to accomplish so timely delivery would show ccps involvement and interest in the csm program lack of delivery or a long delay would have its own meaningthe meeting notes from review of that request  and deliverylack of delivery of the list by ccp  would say a hell of a lot more than anything else about the value of the csm program

it would be nice to have generic access control lists that work like group permissions on unixin your sma you have the options to view put take each of these options can be associated with two groups of tags each tag is a group of people or a corporation or the alliance one group of tags is the allow list the other is the deny listyou could for example put my UFFFDber alliance into the view and put groups so for a jump bridge your alliance pilots can all check how much fuel is in there and put fuel in if its needed the three corporations dedicated to defending this particular system could have take access but then those two players who keep losing ships but never posting killmails they go on the deny list for view put takeeach tag is thus a representation of a group of people and multiple tags can go into each type of access control list slotserver side each character node would keep track of the tags that a character belongs to and the character node would interrogate the acl of whatever container is being accessed the most specific allowdeny would have precedence  thus if im in a list of 10 people who have take access but im also in a list of 3 people who are denied take access i am denied take access

bunyip since your time in csm weve had the orca introduced and exploration has been massively overhauledthere is nothing stopping a miner spending a few days training astrometrics buying a t1 astrometrics frigate probing down an asteroid pocket getting the orca pilot to warp to the field then switching to the hulk storing the frigate in the ship maintenance bay the orca pilot could even be doing the exploration while the hulk pilots are miningrequin this will not prevent macros the macrouser would just set their mining bookmark to the appropriate location start the macro and walk awaywhat would work against macros is to limit the volume of ore in any pocket a pocket limited to about an hours effort for two hulks  orca fleet should reduce the value of a mining macroto make this work i would keep a certain number of pockets in a system respawning at a random location after some delay in higher sec systems the pockets would contain less ore there would be fewer of them and they would take longer to respawn after being depleted and have a higher variance in respawn time thus the folks who can log in immediately after downtime arent getting an unfair advantage in the mining game and the need for reseeding during downtime is removedas an example someone wanders into a 07 system and probes down eight pockets each pocket in this system is picked from the set of twenty available for that security label system these 07 pockets are on a respawn timer of 120 min UFFFD30 minthese timers and pocket sizes could be adjusted to provide the same maximum volume of ore per day for any given system so rather than have a belt respawning at dt with 500k units of veldspar that system could have one pocket with 100k units of veldspar with a 4h 45m UFFFD30m respawn delay a maximum of five respawns per 23h day assuming 30m to clear out 100k unitsthe variance in the respawn time would work to prevent people setting up schedules for returning to a particular pocket and thus allow opportunistic miningthese asteroid pockets would be specific to that system as opposed to other exploration sites which migrate around a constellationregion there could be similar pockets that migrate to other systems of the same security typeone security type could cover 07 systems with a higher proportion of scordite than plagioclase another security type could cover 07 systems with a higher proportion of kernite than scordite thus heavy mining of scordite in emolgranlan could lead to higher volumes of scordite spawning in atgur both emolgranlan would have their normal system asteroid pockets but the regionwide securityclass pockets would always spawn elsewhereleaving the actual mechanic of mining as it is but adding the need for exploration and surveying should be enough to spice up the profession a little while simultaneously making life a little more difficult for macroers and opportunistic gankers
tbh if you want to make it harder for macros to mine and somewhat more interesting to do give the player a little minigame read game not inane click sink or whatnot so its not just hit f1 wait for cargohold to fill i think making every site a scandown site is a little extreme and doesnt really solve the mining is boring as  problemtheres so much dead time in this game mining and ratting should not simply be activate lasersweapons wait for roidsrats to die why arent we using the sleeper ai for all npc rats again
thank you all for the contributions to the forum this is not a new idea and may have been discussed before but has not yet been implemented so that it remains validbunyip i m interested in reading your consept and i wait for it when you can post iton the contribution of mara thanks very enlightening if somewhat complex but well this is eve in my opinion base the amount of mineral in small amounts can help but do not know if this may discourage the mining and this would involve major changes my proposal goes on the side of the mechanism used in the wormholes and that is already implemented and would only have to be exported to new edenand do not think macros are dedicated to exploring do a bookmark in the new fields would require more than one and then activate it at least i do not think that most would dothey do it macro because its easy is automatic and is afk and the fact that every day of every week of every month will be mandatory search fields with probes not going to like muchi might be wrong but i think they are lazy and not going to do itplease check the box if you want to give me your support when you do the post the more people do this more attention to this matter to be discussed in the csm and ccpthx again
this on board scanner or add a special dedicate high slot for a probe launcher similar to the one on the zephyrthe training time is reasonably small but the second part of your comment show that you think in terms of alts and not players try that with a new player no orca no skill to pilot even an exumer no isk to buy one or the other balancing the game around old players and their alts is really a horrible way to go support to the general idea
venkul you are right in part but in the early days you are not mining too much perhaps some fields can be located in some areas for rookies but to prevent the macros mostly an agent in this system could give a bookmark to go there and you can only access these agents if you finish the industry tutorial this give you time to train the proper skills for exploration training this skills and be able to do it well for a rookie dont take more than a week two if it takes all the skills to lv4 with appropriate learning skills and think they are avaliable in a tutorial im not sure so no investmentthe mining agent mechanics that wich give you the bm can be a nice tool too

hii am really disappointed with the current state of what i like to refer to as real exploration where you explore different systems looking for signatures i see that ccp has tried to encourage this with exploration tutorials improved scanning system and wspace ofcourse but i feel kspace exploration sites are really lacking but the low iskhr of the profession really hurts it compared to the vastly superior anomaly or mission running in high sec and upgraded systems problem 1ded complexes are just so weak now they used to give many more opes and are not worth the effort required usually they have a chance for a really good complex item if ofcourse they are of a particular faction if they wanted to curb the isk gain from infrastructure spwaned deds why not just create seperate instances of those complexes  instead they got lazy and nerfed all ded complexes even those rare few you find through normal exploration suggested solution 1increase the rate of opes to what it was before the rate of opes is so low now when before you could get an ope in every room and now you only guaranteed one in the last room and if possible create seperate complex instances for the ones spawned from infrastructure upgrades problem 2the loot from radars and mags for some factions is far too inconsistent and for most factions really needs to be looked at suggested solution 2personally even just removing the dreaded empty cans and guaranteeing all cans yield something will go a long way but id like to see much more consistent rate of t2 salvage and much more consistent rate of decryptors from radarsproblem 3 low spawn rate of unrated complexes they can be as rare as deds sometimes and only have a chance for faction spawn and escalation these are really the gem of real exploration and should be the main reason to do it i do believe they are the main reason in high sec because a good escalation can be very profitable once again if for the right faction suggested solution 3increase the rate at which unrated complexes spawn so that real exploring actually has a good chance at faction spawns and escalations more regularly if you could find twice as many unrated complexes as there is now it would actually be worth it to explore as opposed to the other far more profitable iskhr professions the way it stands exploration is a very low iskhr profession surpassed by almost everything else i dont want it to be the best but atleast lets make 00 and low sec exploration comparable to other professions that have much less risk come on ccp exploration is a great feature of eve its the only interesting form of pve where you can actually feel like your in a living universethanks
well to startexploration has its bugs yesit is also all chance basedi run on average of 310 sites a day all sig typesfor 10min work in a hs radar site i can make a least 10millfor 30min work in a serp 310 i can make 500mill if im really luckyfor 30min in a serp 410 again upwards of 500mill in drops again if really lucky30 min in 1 lowsec radar site netted me 300mill in decriptors components and bpcsthe issue u are experiencing is that ur scanning and finding the  others dont want to run thats not to say its not goodi had a period of time where every unrated site i ran would escalate in the end i came away with 5 vig bpcs2 daredevil bpcsover 30 shadow mods 22 ctype med reps5 ctype eanms2 atype eanms2 full sets snakes only 1 omega though UF04C various drone components t2 salvage out the rectanus i do agree that mag sites are below average in all regionsif ur not getting the hits u want then move ur scanning raught
ive had results like yours elenor ive been exploring in all regions of space for a long time now the problem is your not accounting for the time it takes to find sites and not just do them i can name my great days when i make 500mil or 1bil but i can also remember many many days where i would waste a lot of time scanning ultimately you have to start timing your isk from the moment you undock and start scanning to be able to compare it fairly youll find even on good days its still well below other professions especially if you add that up over a month how many good days and bad days have you had take the the iskhr of each day and average it out over a months worth of explorationmy exploration char flys a tengu with perfect scanning skills every single of my other profession chars can average a higher iskhr
explore in groups with your corporationa team of 5 explorers and 1015 fighters can make a lot of money and with 5 explorer you find very often interesting sitesexploration like all proffessions is not for alone playersif youre missioning solo or mining solo you dont get much benefit than exploring in soloso just find corpmates to make this proffession and youll get a lot of isk and fun 
to quote ccp well really we dont like items having special status in the gamereference
only if all the empires get to claim sov and stick cyno jammers in every system 
this is interesting supported
they see me trollin they hatinthose items are restricted for gameplay reasons plex were not
step 1 item restrictions liftedstep 2 some hole decides to doomsday jita much chaos ensuesstep 3 total and complete market crash due to increasingly violent attacks prices go through the roof and no one can get anything for decent moneystep 4 step 5 will it sure as hell aint a profituse your heads people stop being so damned dense for once
only if security hits are non recoverable accrue on all the characters on your account if one character get a standing it and to all the characters that do direct trade or or set persona contracts for characters with negative standing and characters with negative standing cant be biomassed or sold that way firing a bomb at the docking point of jita 44 has real consequences with the current mechanics it is too easy to recover negative standing and it has very few consequences
mara rinn cyno jammers in every system sure  why not let faction war corps anchor cyno jammers and other pos structures on behalf of the faction let faction war actually be uh war in stead of some cripple fight in lowsecstick cult this is
uh dds are singletarget these daysnot that i like the idea or anything just sayin
i think there is an option let ally the opportunity to declare war on empiresthis way the members in war with an empire could use cyno and all stuff in this empire without restriction but the entire empire will be at war with themyou want challenge you get it 
i agree with these assessments actually either have actual cyno jammers in place which could be destroyed like any other or specifically let the fw folks deploy and maintain them concord presence is the only difference between system sec if you want to move a cap into jita go ahead so long as it doesnt break any laws while there id love to see a titan accidentally dd the wrong ship and watch as a fleet of concord caps spawn to take it down sec status how about just a flag on negative toons for can not be biomassed then people cant cause havoc and trash the toon afterwards ccp already delights in players having tons of accounts so heres another motivation to pay extra to keep playing when all your slots are filled with criminals
it does break belivability when these things occuri support the activate any module anywhere you want initiativeits not really belivably that naughty pirates wouldnt find away around the failsafes that stop modules activating in high secof course thats not to say that there use should be condoneddropping a bubble in low sec  high sec should give a sec hit  gcc  concordokken  high sec gate guns should pop bubbles with priority as navigational hazardsbut bubbles in lowsec asteroid belts would be effectivecynos in high sec okcarriers and dreads in high sec without permission of the faction  never given  means flying a carrierdread again  sec hit  gcc  concordokkenbut its still a better solution than the ah you cant use this module here bs
this would be epic if empire and the 00 allince went to war the entire game would change concord wouldbe able to help as much from trying to defend themselves while titans try to invade jita and amarr it would be epic
andare great additions to my proposal thanks guys

with so many people saying t2 bpos being left in the game is fine and has no effect on invention then lets bring back the old lottery system that way current bpos owners dont have to worry about their isk printing presses being taken away and newer players actually have a chance at the t2 production market
you are such a ing you dont even deserve a proper answer why dont you troll a different forum section one that isnt meant to be useful
yeah and a damn hypocrite to bootfirst he es about tech 2 bpos and now he wants them

no one said that hitup wwwdictionarycom and try looking up the words you dont understand as you reread the posts in your other postalternatively if english isnt your first language you might need
cromos crazy rants not withstanding i do like this ideaeves player base has grown substantially since release and yet the number of t2 bpos has not i think it would be interesting to see what would happen if another 510 of each bpo was put up for the lottery i know i would not win because i dont have a research agent but i would still like to see it happen

ohh dear god how wrong you are its not even funny anymore1 i dont own any t2 bpos hell i havent even seen one however i do make my money off inventionwe control the market not the bpo owners bpo owner makes 1 insert moduleshipwhatever and can only ever make 1 at a time 1 bpo 1 run at a time me i invent a ton of of bpcs and poof i can make 11 in the same time that mr bpo makes 1 i will give you that they have a larget profit margine per unit due to not having to invent but the money trickles in considerably slower than memy proposal is let em keep there bpos they will eventualy die due to getting exploded in idiotic situations and people just unsubbing with them in there posetion why should once again people be penolised for playing this game for longer than you
old players have enough of an advantage without this unfair mechanic or offer procedure to create t2 bpos with unlimited runs to everybody else
no i like my t2 stuffs cheapid support boosting invention to get improved base mepe though so inventors could effectively compete with bpo holders in stuff like t2 frigatesmaybe do it through decryptor effects all decryptors should give only positive effects and better bonusesthis is boosting exploration too
invested 0 isk i must have imagined the billions i spent on my t2 bposjust leave it already
i just reported you for tolling drake as for the rest of you mother ers that think its cool to troll and derail all my threads i will be reporting you tootry reading the forum rules before opening your mouth next timenow back to the topiclike i said players should not be allowed to get the benefit of a rig without training for it
you get the full penalty of the drawbacks someone with the appropriate skill trained to 1 gets 10 less penaltyim not sure what the complaint actually is you nerf your ship with the drawback that is usually out of proportion to the benefit gained
sniff sniffyou smell that ccp its a troll thread
the only troll here is the one who types in bold all the timelooks like thats just you
if agree with the ops proposal and support his suggestion that if you board a rigged ship and you dont have the skills to fly it ccp will come to your home and kill your dog
get out
this thread makes me laugh
lolits not an exploit its intended ccp had the idea that we might manage to make a profession out of rig fitting didnt really work out but thats no reason to remove it anyway if you dont have the skills youll get a larger penalty from the rig or didnt you read the descriptions properly
great idea
supported more security is always ok if you want to sell your character 1 week is what youll be aiming for the auction at the minimum anyway so im also open to other ideas but the general intent is good and thus supported
hahid love to see someone try to gank a skiffand the miner says could you move a bit closer to that merc rockand then it erupts
well colonized and linked systems are but a small  of the actual solar systems in the eve galaxy the cluster is actually quite small in diameterid just say that explorers found hazardous and dangerous systems and just said scratch that and never linked em on the other hand in wspace you go wherever wormholes go so dangerous zones are quite commonps for comparison the milky way which isnt one of the biggest galaxies is about 100k light years across and about 1k light years thick i doubt the eve cluster is even 200 ly across for what we know we may even be quite close to earth though unlikely since triangulation on known cepheids would have been made back when the eve wormhole was open
it started out strong  new features are cool rightbut then it fell to pieces when it became obvious that the suggested idea is merely a thin disguise for an entirely different agenda  make mining safer
geeked out a little and checked on dotlan after a rough visual estimate of the two systems furthest away since the map is flattened its not really that accurate but whatever i came up with an approximate of 114 ly between cobalt edge and period basis though this is the travel distance with carrier jumps actual distance seems to be a little shorter due to the curve of the route for reference clicky  so lets say that the eve cluster is roughly 120 ly across even smaller than what i said previouslynow back to the topic pi personally wouldnt mind some more hazardous places around but there must be a reason for them simply placing dangerous systems around means that people will probably avoid them otoh placing valuable resources in them for no apparent reason isnt much betterstill supported varied ambients are cool
i propose a new rig for ships who have lot of cargo capacity cargo organisation  bonus  allow the organisation of cargo at the expense of cargo capacitydrawback  x to cargo capacity ammount as to be definedthe organisation will be like a corporation hangar faciliting the life of all big haulersthe only problem is that freighter ships dont have a rig slotmaybe they could have one but only dedicated to astraunotics rigs  i dont know maybe there is another way to do it
use containersalso most provide extra space inside using scifi physics
im thinking of a real simple way to organize cargo we can imagine a system which can allow every defined space of the cargo haing the totality of the cargo space availablefor example you could have 1 place for ammo and 1 for moduleswhen there is cargo space available you can add ammomodule until the whole spaces not emptyimagine moveable wall in the cargo bay wich can adapt to the goods in the cargo it could be very usefull for traders or to move assets without having to open 50 boxes when you arrive at destination
or you can use list or detail view mode instead of icon and click on the group column just a thought
well yesbut the other interest of this rig allright i didnt mentioned it before is against gankwith a scan cargo youll just see the different compartiment names but not the list of itmesalso it can be used as a moveable corp hangar
and now the truth comes outyou want a rig that turns your private cargo bay into a corp hangar so the baddies cant see your phat lewtzwhen it comes to organization just use containers instead of sacrificing cargo space as your rig drawback youll be gaining 530 more spacewhen it comes to avoiding pregank scanning use courier contracts this will package up whatever you have into a small nondescript box the contents of which remain unknown until manually openedof course when people scan your cargo and see a bunch of courier packages they may gank you just to see whats in them kinda like xmas presentsstill not supported
correction only if you contract stuff in containers people cant see the content plain courier contract wont make it invisible to cargo scanners

vaal erit trollsupportedit is frustrating for many that they dont know when ccp will charge their credit card etc some like to change payments i have actually petitioned this from ccp with no response would like to see csm support
the few times i have payed with plex ive never seen itedit also the way i pay with my accounts isnt your problem i just dont see why its a big issue to make the timer always show it seems like it would be more work to only make it show sometimes
im paying with plex and it shows me when i have less than 10 days hmm another bug
if you have ever paid with a recurring payment method you will not be shown the countdown regardless of what payment method you currently useso for people like me who have a credit card set up but prefer to pay by plex where possible the only current option is to mark the date in the diary then comes the complexity of 30 day account cycles versus calendars that want to do 28 day cycles or calendar month cycles but nothing in betweenjust show the countdown until the next payment of any kind is due with an option to hide that countdown
im already on the 2 months break since the rl kicked in do i countalso try not to post stuff like this in assemly hall
csmyou talk about csm7 but still no news from csm 6 my priority interest is  did you presented the backlog player priority list to ccp  do you wait a backlog resolution planning from ccp will ccp add developers to solve the backlog please i will be happy with yesnodont know answersthere is no answer from your side and ccp just tell us looks gives we have a good carbon engine and we know about lag againare you all waiting us to get out of the game and let the people that dont see the bug playing yeay
1 yes see this wiki article for details2 we have received some information from ccp have some clarification requests in and are preparing a report we hope to issue shortly3 we dont know
trebor daehdoowthank younow its clear that the point is 100 on ccp sidethere is a clear post on the pointcsm does its part of the job as player concilyeay
interesting perspective but consider this pve isnt everyones preferred cup of tea either but for the majority of players that want to pvp in eve a good deal of pve is a necessity at least in games like early uo shadowbane and darkfall the pve took place in an entirely open pvp environment making the experiences of both pve and pvp mesh together in eve this isnt the case for all pve because the differences in gains between the near free pvp areas and the pvp areas is not that significant completing pve in the largely pvp free areas is the clear choice for both pve and pvp focused playersso when you ask me for justification of making pve focused players deal also with pvp a simple answer would be to tell you because pvp focused players already have to deal with lots of pveim not sure what pvp fundamentalism is i did read your post in the link but im definitely not reading that whole thread on ankh im going to say im probably not a pvp fundamentalist since i dont think in a strictest sense its even about pvp vs pve at least not from my perspective ideally the lines between pve and pvp should be blurred as with pcs and npcs to artificially separate the two is to drive towards theme park type game play in their ideal form sandbox mmorpgs offer players complete freedom to act out their virtual existence constrained only by mechanics that are in place to maintain the integrity of the shared fantasy world or more specifically its lore whether that be the worlds laws of physics or its historical and political framework so i suppose that makes me something of a simulationist yet where my thought process comes from on this probably matters little to most in the end on this particular issue i side with pvpers its given considering eves historical and political lore is one of conflict and that things like disallowing pirate players to enter high sec yet npc pirates have thousands of ships there in player missions makes no sense from simulationist perspectiveheres my olive branch to the pvp phobic however small and wilted it may be  if most pve combat was moved out of high sec as well as most of the mining i would happily see high sec made safer and things like suicide ganking in high sec addressed but until that time comes i praise suicide gankers wardecers ninjas and can flipers as a true blessing to eve
xov is not a pvp fundamentalist for your definition far from it from what i gather he think that only combat pvp is pvpthe problem is that he think he has the right to a special treatment and that the game revolve only around his playstile
deliliah doesnt have a definition shes just trolling pvpers by claiming that those people who realize that eve is a pvp game and that ccp deliberately designed it that way and explicitly said so clearing up her trollingfauxconfusion must be fundamentalists if she really gets going shell write another sophomore english paper describing how derrida would agree that the narrative of playerversusplayer deconstructs the social norms inherent in a postmodern reading of intragroup conflict also if she really gets trolling shell talk about how people who realize that eve is a pvp game must be similar to biblical literalists and abortion clinic bombers because after all theres pvp and also cooperation and as we all know pvp games certainly dont have cooperation when you log into a game of team fortress ii you are activcely discouraged from ganging up with a group of people and working towards a common goal pvp means wacky anarchy stuff and tfii isnt a pvp game anyways since you can build stuff and heal people and just sit around while your teammates yell at you if you want so really its a cosmos shes a funny troll when you realize that she takes herself very very seriously and actually thinks that shes providing some sort of scholarly analysis it all gets put in much better context if you know that she was an absolutely bat crazy frenzied supporter of ank who lied constantly and claimed that anks own words quoted and verified were smears or trolling that was debunked but oddly could never explain how they were debunked or shown to be false she later went on to meltdown a bit and claimed that despite it being confirmed by numerous people that ank really never threw a spoon at anybody nopers now she writes pretentious twaddle about eve i liked her trolling better when she was just a shill for ank
if we were forced to trade through lowsec systems and forced to pass through lowsec in general it would be absolute disaster to the game our current server peak is around 50000 players if you remove carebears form the game its going to drop to around 25000 players or lessmany people play this game alone or with small groups of people and these people wouldnt stand a chance even in an envoy against griefing pirate campers who would love nothing more than for carebears to be forced to travel through their territory im strongly against all of the ops suggestions i think its a terrible idea that many peaceful players would absolutely hate it would change the game to pure pvp and there would be no use even trading anymoreforcing a play style upon someone is not the way to go in eve eve is the largest most diverse mmo out there and if you streamline it like this it becomes a linear piece of crapthis op has the most ridiculous impossible ideas ever theres just no way that forcing carebears to be slaughtered is in any way going to be a good thing for the eve universe if you want to do that you may as well take out all elements of economy in the game and redesign the game to have no isk and simply you skill up for a ship then fly it and then go straight to fighting eachother
a good addition to your
gonna raise this as well as other stuff i will be adding before the meeting
i agree that would be a nice thing but adding it now would bypass the crowdsourcing we did on the ui proposal if you raise it as a proposal in the ah it can be separately considered by csm as a standalone proposal my personal plan is to repeat the crowdsourcing for each expansion planning cycle
consider the original thread has been around since late 2006 i for one think its something that should be focused as soon as possible
yesi posted in that old thread a long time ago
i agree small ship maintainence bay would be awesome and maybe give it instead of a corp hangar a bomb bay to carry around bombs for the stealth bombers or not if that sounds outrageous
this is not allowed to drop off of the first page sonudge not a full bump just a nudge
sensible ideas to develop player driven courier hope ccp could find some programmer love for the task
right on the mark this proposal
i leik pizza
i will bring up this issue at the next csm meeting 
please god yesi understand that ccp want planetary interaction to be engaging but this mindless clickfest is not the way to do it going to every single extractor and clicking waiting for the scan then selecting your deposit is absolutely fubar it doesnt encourage any sort of thought beyond inspiring the desire to drill holes into ones own headi find setting up pi to actually be a very cathartic and rewarding experience you start to see your colony grow and sometimes it takes on shapes that you didnt even plan for squeezing every last bit of powergrid out of your ccs can be a fun little strategy game and then the fun diesthere is no reason to not batch extractors i see the logic behind working for your passive income at least a little bit but what we have here is not work it is a waste of time the dynamic nature of setting your pi up in the first place is work but when everything is set up there is no more thinking involved so why force us to click 100 times like mindless slavering dronesincidentally im not raging about this because i just want things to go faster the heart of this issue is that there is nothing more you really need to do after you set things up now if ccp were kind enough to make pi a more fluid and organic experience i would happily click away and be content with spending my time doing it until then though please let us batch extractors on a planet
i have not abandoned low sec and it is distressing to hear people say they think theyve wasted their vote  a lot of my csm effort so far has been devoted to improving process and communication with ccp to help ensure that csm is taken seriously and our ideas given due consideration without that foundation no amount of attention to low sec will matterthat list linked a couple of posts up was built from the items already in the csm backlog low sec revitalization is not going to happen by implementing a collection of unrelated changes whether of the low hanging fruit variety or not if you read the minutes section on the twohour low sec discussion you know that resources to address changes on the scale of an expansion which low sec would likely require are not going to be available for 18 to 24 months because of prior commitments to other projects by ccpit doesnt make sensegiven that time frameto jump the gun by pushing through a low sec proposal without making sure that it represents the best possible options for improving low sec if we want ccp to focus on low sec we have to captivate game designers like ccp greyscale with a great story that describes what we want low sec to be like accompanied by a bunch of holistic ideas to illustrate the themes in that story while greyscale said at the summit that a low sec revitalization would likely require an initial expansion it only makes sense that any proposal include ideas that would be good candidates for interation over time that would allow low sec to evolvehopefully according to a plan and a vision that we the players largely definedrico your outlaw proposal is full of great ideas i supported it but others have had some excellent ideas as well how do we combine them all into one proposal that makes sense from the story perspective that ccp uses in its development process to evaluate ideas and design game changes these forums suck for that they allow no cross pollination of ideas nor can gems hidden within other proposals rise to the top if those proposals dont get overall supportthats why i made the making low sec matter community at ideascale outlaw is one of the key items for background reading ideascale is ideal for sharing voting on and discussing individual ideas you can assign categories and tags to ideas easily find related topics and through voting ideas up or down allow the most popular ones to bubble to the topwe have time to think about the content and approach of a low sec proposal that will reflect popular ideas encompass a variety of playstyles and speak in ccps scrum language by telling a story of what we want low sec to be and illustrating it with the best ideas out there id like to have something to submit to ccp by mid to late october for discussion at the december summit this thread may very well form the basis of that proposal but there are also other ideas well worth including the ideascale community is helping to gather process and weigh those ideas i urge you to participate there add your ideas from this proposal and encourage others to go vote on and discuss them this is not something i can do by myself it requires community effort i hope you will get involved if you havent alreadyand i hope youll encourage everyone you know with an interest in low sec to do the same
greetingsas an lowsec inhabitant for many years as an outlaw this might be a good place to state some opinionsit is my impression that lowsec is intentionaly excluded from developing by ccp not much ppl live here those that do obviously dont matte much to devs it is general thought in both hi and 00 space that outlaws are poor pathetic creatures who cannot make make a stand in 00 or live happy in hi sec low sec is generally ment to be avoided on autopilot and only as a place for cynos on the way to 00well that is patheticlow sec is a place for supreme most finest pvp where you can use all the fancy implants and fancy mods to achieve victory in fightstrue outlaws are pvpers who loath all the 00 bublle s massive blobs whre you get to be only a cannon fodder for huge alliances and theire leaders who make real money out of harvesting rich 00 resourcesit is in human nature to be a part of a group but it also is in human nature to be recognosed as an idividual 1000 pos warfare hardly makes you special in any waylow sec does not have a lot to offer except pvp and that is why it is so emptymove all the lvl4 agents in low sec you will get a baby boom herethere is allready enough ways to make richies in hi sec other than farming lvl4 missionsremove all the capital modules capabilities from low sec and you will get finest most glorious battles to be spoken aboutthese two things do not require much of a devs work time but would change the the ppls minds and encourage them to do brave thingso7kramb
not according to the mission runners i asked about what would bring them to low sec
yes
it is already very easy to hide behind alts lets not make it even easier to avoid consequences
there are no consequences scammers dont undock scamees dont bother to check names corp thieves dont do it with their mainsthe bottom line is anybody who does these things with their main character does not care to change their name anybody who does this with an alt does not need to change their nameas long as there is a link to previous names there is no reason not to support this
as long as there is a name history located in the characters show info i really dont see the problem with this also i would charge a plex to change a name and a free name change if the character is soldtry reading the thread first before postingthere already is no consequences for these people so what exactly would change currently people either just sell their character or delete it and if character name changes are traceable and costly i dont see how it would change anything the point of this proposal is to allow people who bought a character or named their character someone real bad at the start a onetime chance to do it again if all the loopholes for scammers are cut out via a character name history then what is the problem

supercapitals online we have all heard that phrase and giggled at it  but is it merely the latest in doomsayer talking point i do not believe sotitans are still largely restricted to 00 due to being supersized dreadnaughts moms on the other hand have become so common that smallish lowsec corporations can field several and the larger nullsec alliances can outright blob with themthis proposal is meant to address the ease with which supercapitals are currently being built without increasing their costs much as well as allow for more skirmish type combat in the great beyondmy proposal ihub to have same anchoring rules as tcu infrastructure upgrades iu to be attachments on the ihub and reinforcable like station services reinforcing any iu disables any and all functionsfeatures relying on said iu ie supercapital construction iu ehp to be sufficiently high so that they cannot be used as shortcuts ex twice that of a cyno jammer high enough to not be a cakewalk but low enough to not need uberblobs requires sovereignty holders to stay alert and actively patrol their space no longer able to just plan the next blob when timers dictate alliance space size more dependent on actual people using it rather than on how many can be fielded come crunch time allows for attrition warfare by small and large entities alike using fast and ganky fleets instead of capital blobsnotesiu ehp should be resist based to make repairing them easier than just raw values  balancingallowing ihubs at poss as is customary for tcus should minimize disorganized grief incapping of upgrades
this is not going to achieve anything towards the purpose of what you are trying to do areas where supercap construction occurs very rarely sees a force big enough to incap these iusit would not really change anything as far as i can see
that is because you need full blown blob to get anything done today and with yard systems tucked away in the back chances are it is a one way trip except if absolute number superiority can be hadgiving smaller forces something to shoot no matter where they go will guarantee that said smaller forces will go everywhere  just think about the distance that regular roams cover this merely gives even more purposeoptions to that kind of fleetuse it to disorientconfuse an enemy to hamper his cash flow disrupt his construction break his bridge network etc it is not just an anticapital proposal although that is what encouraged it but rather a way for the nullsec crowd to have an option other than grabbing the batphone when the neighbour needs a stern talking to

theres really 4 limitations that a mothership needs that seleene aka abathor overlooked when creating these overpowered poss1 remove drones from the bomber bay create a separate drone bay ccp already said they were intending to do this but a year later and a few devs removed i think the idea got lost give motherships a 500 m3 drone bay and restrict them to 5 standard drones launched2 remove fighter capabilities of motherships motherships have fighter bombers thats their purpose not fighters allowing them the capabilities of both means they can attack far to many varieties of ships 3 remove rr bonuses of motherships as much as i hate the idea of any capital spider tank i hate even more the fact that a super can do it if motherships want to survive on passive tanks then fine but allowing a swarm of them to rr each other completely removes the need for a carrier hence the reason we see everyone migrating to motherships as soon as they get the cash for one4 reduce mothership hp by about 25 of their current level also change the hel bonus to a 75 per level shield cap bonus since its the most impacted by this these four things should actually balance motherships to where they still have huge tanks still have huge dps but it reigns in on their ability to be a jack of all trades for virtual invulnerability in large groups
check
i do not like your ideas no support
they just got boosted as much as i hate having the things dropping on my head constantly in low sec its a bit too soon after theyve been boosted to nerf them into oblivion which is what your post is essentially suggesting
propose a pvp arena for casual pvp in an controlled environment set number of opponents 1v1 2v2 or uneven numbers if agreed upon in an instance where others cannot interfere directly or indirectly corpie blob neut rr or fleet bonusconsidering the amount of jetcans with a single unit of ammo outside highsec stations this feature is obviously wanted by many people they have to make do with imperfect makeshift method since we dont have a real arena there may be many reasons why the practice is so prevalent could be lack of time unwillingness to roam through deserted lowsec hardly meeting a soul in hours or just finding blobing only form of pvp still existing in the wild boring if nothing else it should ease server load by making undock jetcans in already high population systems go away
runescape eve  sandbox
there might be support for a duealing option between neutrals so concord doesnt interfere but nothing really suggest there is significant ammount of support for an arena feature on the contrary there is significant amount on people resisting any kind of arena feature we know this because of the resistance this idea initiated when players found out that ccp had tried and failed to implement such a featureanyway not supported
if only a mere fraction of the undocking gamer and jetcanners want this feature there would be huge amount of support those who dont want to use it dont have to its not mandatory the only net effect in game would be moving the crowd at undocking port to their own arena and maybe introduce pvp to a few carebears who wouldnt touch it otherwise it wont have any effect on blobers
supporting my own topic no downsides to it
the real problem with this idea is that it goes against everything that eve tries to be which is a sandbox where there are no rules and safe ways of doing things eve tries to mimic real life in this regard and there is nothing comparable to what you are requesting in real life as it would require a controlled environment
undocking gamer lolwut canflippers and other people do not want this feature trickkilling noobs with mining fits in hi sec is far different from a setup engagement where both people agree to pvp also this would be a terrible introduction to pvp as an arena would have almost nothing in common with real pvpan arena is out of place in a game like eve in eve you are constantly in danger and always at risk even if that risk is very low adding in norisk mechanics and instances to eve is the exact opposite of what the developers are trying to do with eve and would destroy what makes eve unique
if you take things to extremes there wont be a highsecall the arena would do is take ppl playing undocking jetcan games and give them a place to do what theyre trying to do by choice anyway sandbox style no one is forcing you to fight in an arena let whomever wants it use it without it those same ppl will continue ejecting cans trying to create a makeshift arena failing and adding to the clutter at undock ports you cannot force them to join blobs and pvp your way theyll just ignore you and keep ejecting cans instead let them do what they want sandbox stylearenas tournaments and the subsequent gambling revolving around it developed naturally in the real world it would have in eve too if players were able to build an arena unfortunately they cant so undocking ports get cluttered with jetcans holding one unit of ammo
first bar in mind that this is independent of the aggro issues in empire and on gates ccp knows about them and its their problem to sort logistics ships were put into this game to be the forefront of repairing abilities as such id like to see them get triage capabilities that might create an even more dynamic ability for them without overpowering themwith that in mind id like for logistics to get a role bonus that allows a compact triage module fitting because of the nature of a cruiser class ship there are obvious delema to the negative side effects of a classic triage module so the new module would do the following50 per level bonus to armorshield and remote repair amount50 per level bonus to armorshield repair and remote repair duration100 per level increase to eccm strength50 reduction in speed75 increase to signature radiusinability to be repaired while in triageduration 25 minutes100 strontium per cycle with a 15 reduction per level skill what does this doprobably the most notable is that it creates the potential to repair pos under cyno jammers in enemy territory this ultimately benefits smaller scale warfare because the necessity to always remove cyno jammers to save towers is gone it also creates a variety of tactics and fittings around logistics the idea of bait guardians in small scale warfare comes into play where maybe its formatted around super tank rather than rr abilities maybe your attempting a dual setup where medium repairers are used in conjunction with plating and local repairers rather than the traditional large repairer format theres also the shield side where logistics may receive a massive bonusthis adds another sandbox concept that creates more dynamics for players to decide on a logistics ship in triage with 4 large armor repairers with the above bonuses would do the following4 x 384  1536 repair2304 x 250  384045 seconds t2  25  18384018  2123 repairs or 1280000 hp per 10 minor with 4 medium reps 640000 hp per 10 minthat compared to a carrier not in triage currently with 4 repairers1500 x 4  60005 second rof60005s  1200 repairs or 720000in traige a carrier does 12000 repair every 25 seconds or 4800 repairs which is 2880000 mil hp per 10 minie logistics do their logistical duty but carriers become the super logistic in a battlefield setting while also having the non logistical ability to project offense out of triage or a larger logistical ability if you desire to risk it on a tower repairto me sounds like a role for each rather than letting carriers spider tank and swarm with their current massive hp disclaimerwhile this is not directly linked to the following i think it should be the ultimate goal even still it should be a good concept because of the diversity of options it allows i want to state up front that this is an effort to move away from capital bonused remote repair when not in triage ie their range boost i think spider tanking capitals are horrible in this game and therefore no bonuses ie range should apply unless a carrier is in triage
so speed and sigradius are a big bit of your tank and you wanna take that awayand as it stands  logistic cruisers are already pretty powerful
i think a big hole in this is that with the 50 rof increase and the inability to receive rr logis are not going to be able to sustain the cap for that setup at all even with a full cap regen setup which would not be viable in a combat scenario anyways
because a 70 sig radius gaurdian will jump to a whopping 121  gang bonuses  95ish speed yes but its also getting the self repair bonuses which means a still small sig a 300320 speed and self repair its called trade off of course it will lose something it says inability to be repaired not an inability to receive cap transfers
its an interesting idea but personally i think that logis are pretty buffed as is i dont really see a benefit from buffing them further just look at a guardian with logi v pretty high amount of reppage with cap stability to bootedit the only way i can see this being implemented is if the triage mod was very pg heavy and would seriously gimp the logi in other ways
triage carrier cant get any logistics so to be consistent triage logistic cruisers shouldnt be able to recieve cap eitherand yes i think you will notice that increase in sigradiusanyway your arguments are not really convincing thumbs down from me especially guardians dont need a buff
im actually keen on the idea of having all sov mechanics applying to all sec levels the artificial restriction of sec level is another bugbear of minefw has bunkers to kill to gain occupation status nullsec has tcus to claim sovereigntywhat if occupation and sovereignty were a continuum what if npc empires amarr guristas alike had to claim sovereignty what if players could declare loyalty to a faction ie have that faction set them blue thus allowing all actions by that player to benefit the factionso where we currently rat in a system or run anomalies to raise military index or what not the same works for npc empiresonly allow pve folks to accept missions from agents if they are not allied to an enemy factionif you want to reduce someone elses sovereignty go rattingplexingbunkering in their system while youre red to them  sbus and tcus should be one stage of the sovereignty disruptionallow corporations to pay tribute to a faction which will boost that factions presence in terms of npc police forceshave sec status linked to concord index which would require a concord ihub module available only to empires with concord index linked to enemies of concord killed in that system ie rats with bounties low sec would then be empire sovereignty with poor concord index concord index could also be linked to distance from the empires designated capitali would like sec status to be dynamic and i would like serpentis etc to have the ability to harden their space in much the same way the empires can
for all of 3 days then we will have thousand of poor alliance members crying in these forum that faction forces and concord are too strong and asking them to be nerfed high sec people protesting that the server is not working as the invading fleets would totally screw node balancing traders that is is impossible to trade and so ontime a few months depending of length of prepaid subscription and most of the people would have left eve thenyou would have your lag free game with 5000 people on line at peak hours
while i would support bombs in low sec i would not do so in high sec not to mention bubbles and caps the last thing this game needs is to become even more capital ships online
when did the assembly hall shorten its name to the ass hall
dierdra vaal allow me to get off topic for a bit  capital ships online tm is an artifact of the existing cost or relative cheapness vs value of the current ships eg take a golem 615m isk avg vs a chimera 655m isk avg  dare i say that is 
i dont personally like this idea i think that certain things need to stay in low  nullsec for these reasons1 creates an allure for new players to venture into these areas2 having these ships in highsec will pose a threat to the npc factions and would have them attack you think of it like russia bringing a bunch of tanks to the us because they can this will create political tension and will lead to problems3 the game needs to have stable static factors empire concord etc removing these restriction will create a snowball effect of removing restrictions and this will end poorly4 this will make the game even harder for new players who are already struggling trying to understand this game i am mainly referring to bombs in summary i dont think this will be beneficial for the game
galaddamodred im not suggesting removing concord or empire ect im simply suggesting removing the artificial restriction on some items
the problem with this if you look at point 2 after this restriction gets lifted people will suddenly want to be able to attack and capture empire stations etc i think that this opens a whole can of wormsadditionally aside from carriers any capital ship that is not allowed in empire is strictly a large scale combat ship super carriers dreads and titans and as i said i dont know how the empire factions would not perceive this as a threat and react negatively and on the subject of carriers i dont see any legitimate use for these ships in empire the logistics bonus is negligible as you can afk ap to most places and just move things and this will just make the whole station camping and neut rr situation that much worsewithout other caps there is literally going to be no way to kill a carrier in 30 seconds before he docks
bombs hell no can you imagine the concord blob youd get from setting one off outside jita 44 if the node doesnt crash entirely it lags without combat going on as it is despite a dedicated nodeid support bringing capitals into highsec though with the stipulation that all fittings must be offline and that onlining a capital mod or launching any combatewar drones would trigger a concord response nonoffensive subcap modules should be acceptable it would stand to reason that the empire factions would also tightly control capital traffic so standings of 5 and higher with the sovereign faction would make senseand reading the note on docking games with caps in highsec shudder performing any action that aggress you as in allows other players to attack you should also generate concord response undocking a capship during war would be funny  you can show it off but can do just about nothing with it rring would spring to mind but repping an ally gets you an aggression timer against whoever is shooting who youre repping triggering concord for using a capital for aggressive actionsanyway as the op stands not supported
hey i know lets make black ops even more worthless
7 trolling is prohibitedtrolling is the word used to describe a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting the players posts of this nature are disruptive and do not contribute to the sense of community we want for our forums
so first you lost a solo lowsec freighter so you whine about that second you lose a mining ship i assume in a mining fleet because some hostiles came in and you didnt have any defense so you whine about that then you try invention but discover that the one thing you wanted to make was ruined by bpos so you whine about that then the rig thing not sure where that came from now you lose a ratting ship to some bombers that came through a covert cyno so of course you whine about thatstop postingfake edit if a fleet of black ops stealth bombers recons and god forbid blockade runners poses a major threat to your nullsec space you should reevaluate your security
stop this  alreadyjust like all your other proposals this is nothing but rant and whinethe sad part is i dont believe a troll would bother to behave this dumb for so long
your assuming he knows how to readyou give him too much credit
instead of arguing with a flagrant troll the wiser course of action would be to simply ignore his threads
you do realize that each level of rig skill lowers the drawback of the rig dont you thus although unskilled people can get the benefit of the rig they also get a larger penalty for using them
sounds good
email confirmation  1 week timer after email confirmation just to be safe

hi alli was thinking on how to improve the pve aspect of eve if you have played any other mmo you will know that it is nearly impossible to complete the hardest pve tasks alone you also know this is not the case in eve excluding nullsec 1010 plexeshere is my idea on improving this if you have run nonded rated complexes you know that these have a chance to escalade i would like to implement this to missions as wellthe way this would work is that when you complete the mission objective you will have a chance to get a popup screen with a message about a continuation to the mission that will be located 16 jumps away depending on mission level as in plexes the second phase will be more difficult and will require multiple players these will have a new set of rewards from the mission agent and will have to be completed within a standard mission time frame and will incur the same penalties for declining them too oftena feature that will also need to be implemented is that mission completion for escalations will be automatic with the rewards being distributed between all fleet memberswhat i believe this will do is create more cooperation between players who are not affiliated with each other by using the fleet finder tool to create fleet to tackle these escalations this will create a much more challenging pve aspect to evei kind of brainstormed this pretty quick so if you have any idea to improve this please post below and i can edit the op
probably totally pointless to add this because they probably change their mind every few days but ccp said something about group pve in the next expansionbut yea it would be nice level 4s and 5s with the right ship can be soloed and in groups its just loltastic some challenging group missions would be nice even just scaling the mission so that 1 person  missions like they are now 2 people  50 more rats etc
eve pve is easy except for the parts that are not also class 56 wormholeseve pve sucks not because its too easy but because its too predictable there are walkthroughs out there for every mission every complex and every spawn because they are always the same down to the last frigate except for wormholes the npcs are acting completely braindead meaning that pretty much anything can be easily fought with two or three ships pve needs some pretty radical changes to bring it up to par with other games simply spawning bigger and more npcs wont cut it
this is not really true if you look at any other large mmo that has good pve such as wow or even runescape lol there are literally guides for every pve encounter but despite that you are going to need anywhere from 2 to 10 people to be able to kill the boss and still have a good chance to die if you mess upyou have to realize that no matter how dynamic or variant a pve experience is there is always going to be a guide for it because its going to have to operate on some stable factors and patterns
random  difficulty i would settle for just more randomness in my mission spawns
the problem with random is that it still has to have parameters how many variable scenarios can there be 3 5 20 any of these amounts are still going to be figured out and done perhaps even solothe only way i see the pve experience improving is by creating more dangerous  lucrative situations which can easily result in you dying if not done with the proper fleet composition and supportim going to keep referencing wow as it is generally agreed that they have pve figured out pretty nicely in wow there are raids which literally cant be done without a group of people each doing a specific role anything else means deathi think eve should be more similar to that
i think it was mentioned during the last alliance tournament that ccp are working on or at least want to work on some sort of dynamic fleet pve feature that might be what op is looking for we can cross our fingers and hope they get around to doing itthe feature you describe sounds like just turning missions into complexes how would that change the overall pve experience harder complexes are already done with several players or with one player in a bigger ship or one player with multiple accounts
class 56 whs currently top among pve content is hardly hard get a couple of carriers and grind the escalations it has more to do with inaccessibility and logistics people who are willing to put up with the pain in the ass gets to grind it skills play little part
issue the bounty system as it is now is mostly useless a player with a bounty on their head can jump clone into a clone with no implants and get a friend to kill him to claim the bountyidea replace the bounty system with a new type of contract a bounty contract to issue a bounty contract you select the target  can be an individual character a corporation or an alliance you also select the bounty amount time limit and a maximum number of rewarded kills a bounty contract can be issued to the public  in this case it will work much like the system in place now or to an individual to a corporation or to an alliance after issuing the contract the amount of bounty for the given maximum number of kills is withdrawn from the issuer and put into escrowevery time the target or a member of the target corporation or alliance is killed the bounty amount is withdrawn from escrow and deposited into the killers personal corporation or executor corporation wallet this goes on until either the maximum number of kills is reached or the time limit expires if the time limit expires before the number of kills is reached any remaining isk in escrow is returned to the issuernote that a bounty contract by itself does not give the rights to the contractor to attack the target in high security space without punishment from concord the contractor will need to utilize one of the existing game mechanics war declaration aggression suicide ganking to get kills in highsecadditionally there could be an option to pay bounties for pod kills only as it is now for ship kills or for boththe contractor can still make a deal with the target to intentionally kill them in cheap shipspods this is intended but a target can no longer use their own alt character or call their friends to collect the bounty this change would also allow for formalized mercenary contracts making startup mercenary corporations more viablei came up with this idea after reading another of the hundred bounty threads and i do not see any immediate flaws with it but i have also given it only maybe half an hours thought so i would appreciate any comments
questionswhats to stop the targets alt from accepting the contract and killing himself as he does nowwhy not an option to pay a percentage of destruction isk value to prevent people from farming bounty of noobships and instead encourage the economic damage intendedsomething definitely needs to be done about the pathetic bounty system atm but this needs more refinement or it wont do anything to fix the problem
if its a public contract nothing if the contract is issued to a corporation  alliance the target would have to have an alt in that corpalliancefirst its very hard to define isk value of something second the money needs to be in escrow when the contract is issued  how else will you handle the case when the issuer doesnt have enough isk to honor the bountiesthanks for the questions
simply yes we need better bigger overload buttons the ones we have now is tiny and in the heat of the moment you might turn the module of instead of overloading itno further explanation needed
yes something to rework it larger button option to turn that onoff if people dont like it
the opposite actually happens to me i want to activate a module and i overheat it instead there needs to be a button not just click somewhere near the top of the module icon or slightly above italso let ctrl  click a module  overheat
this issue was recently addressed by the csm and was the 2 small issue in our prioritization crowdsourcing effortbefore raising an issue in ah it is a good idea to check the issues in process resolved and rejected sections of the wiki to make sure you are not duplicating something that has already been addressed
venkul i think you are right that this is not a matter of pvp fundamentalism its nice to talk about these issues without that doctrine getting in the way xorv i appreciate the thoughtful and constructive reply i actually dont think our perspectives are that far apart while we may differ on how to balance the various elements of the eve sandbox that seems to me to be a matter of legitimate debate as for myself my primary concern is the griefing of others not piracy or pvp in general pvp is actually my favourite activity and like you i wouldnt want to create entirely safe zones in eve so for example i wouldnt end suicide ganking per se but i would stop rewarding it with insurance payments for the griefers ships id also apply this kind of reasoning to the other elements of eve that are prone to griefing venkul ana and others are making an important point about the diversity of eve as a sandbox perhaps this is a point we can all agree upon even if we differ on certain specifics for instance while i believe pvp is indispensable in the sandbox i dont think it should be the sole or even primary driver of all aspects of eves future development nor should it be the one or prime standard by which everything else is judged not that you are saying this im simply expressing my presuppositions it is with these presuppositions in mind that i approach the issue of a low sec buff it should draw not force people into its space high sec residents who are not looking for this element of the game already have their hands full with the suicide ganks wardecs ninja salvagers can flippers corp thieves and so on i do not think we should impose more upon them as a fix for low sec rather low sec needs a fix in its own right something with positive pull factors instead of negative push factors so may i ask for another opinion from you if only for the sake of discussion and as someone who seems to spend a good deal of time in low sec if you were to look to pull factors as a fix for low sec what would you suggest looking forward to your thoughts on this delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
pretty sure ccp said no to that proposal they felt you didnt want guns to continue firing after reload the csm disagreed but hamerhead wouldnt budge
i totally agree with the idea of disbanding the csm when i was in the csm i hated having to be banded to allow ccp to study my migratory habits the band iched and chafed remove those cruel bands and let the csm fly freebesides we know they all can be found in the better bars within walking distance from nonnis most of the yearissler dainzefinally free of her migratory ccp mandatory csm tracking band
we did put together a prioritized list of development items which included player participation in helping shape the priorities that list was evaluated as part of the dev planning meetings last week based on communications from ccp i feel confident that some csm items are being given dev love for the winter expansion maybe not the sweeping changes that many players would like but every step forwardno matter how smallis progress as soon as ccp has finalized their dev planning and we are allowed to share information about what csm items will be addressed we will do thathopefully in a csm dev bloganyone who is willing to look up from typing their rants against the csm and pay attention to recent dev blogs forum posts by myself and other csm members as well as players in response to dev blogs and individual players blogs should be able to observe a positive trend in the collaboration and communication between ccp and csm these two things have been the primary obstacle to measurable csm accomplishments before now recently the way forward to csm actually being able to get something done has become more accessible the process is still annoyingly cumbersome but there is progressespecially latelythe hobby haters dont want to acknowledge that though some people enjoy being contrary for the sake of it let them shrugs personally i ignore uninformed vitriolic rants against csm players who engage with intelligence and offer informed insightful opinions and suggestions whether for or against the csm will get my attention and influence how i do my job as a csm delegate this is a personal perspective i might add i do not speak for the whole of the csm or for any other delegate
reading through this forum and seeing the endless rubbish that is coming out over incidences of the past couple of daysweeksmonthsyears  i think its time for ccp to just ditch the whole idea of the csmwhat rubbish are you talking about you come in with big guns and no ammo i believe people are smarter than you give them credit for please provide links or the info that you have alleged to have read of endless rubbish so we can see what you see sounds to me to be overembellished if there have been a few incidents it is because they are human and humans will always have their own agendaonce i caught two cops smoking weed according to your style of thinking we should disband the cops all over the world this comment is just as over the topfrom this players pov its a waste of time and effort less than 10 of the player base votes in the farce that is portrayed as an electioni see the accusation i dont see where you may have got that info from where is the poll that gave the players point of viewthe so called representatives garner votes mainly from game alliances and alttrolling campaigns and every csm results in more of the same  nda breaches meta spying allegations of gm corruption etc etc etcokay the first two comments apply to this info info and more info needa religious man told me the hadron collider will create a black hole word of mouth from this religious figure must have been true or did he have his own agenda to date nothing that has been discussed at any of the csms over the past couple of years has resulted in any ingame changes lots of hot air and forum poasts get generated but unfortunately this is not a balloon based mmo so all that effort goes to wastei dont know what they have or have not done as it is not openly discussed if i were you i would be asking that question instead of trying to start a forum riot this would probably be an easier thing to accomplish as well if by chance you do know give us a link to the infoso its time to disband this farcical concept its time that ccp used the money that goes into the csm to hire some more qa or devsthe concept of dust 514 hints to me you may be wrong till dust 514 is released you may have to wait for the changes you seek to come to fruitionnow that would be a worthwhile way for ccp to spend the money we give it each monthyou sound like a person that knows a thing or two about ccps financial patterns really if you have the financial portfolio of ccp do share i would love to see how a successful company spends its money
id like to put
lets get this where do i sign
supportedive seen too many half assed patches its to the point that when i see a dev blog i cringe because i know it means that the devs have chosen to neglect all the unfinished things from last cycle and are starting on a whole new set of things they will never complete im tired of seeing a multimillion dollar company consistently perform at amateur levelsthis is not a new topic either since ccp destroyed the game engine with dominion it has remained broken for a year while ccp is busy burning man hours on browser games pi and avatars for incarna nobody wants another ford pinto fix your  hire some professionals and for the love of god put somebody in charge of development that has an attention span longer than a fishes 
i like their communication nothing but nothing at all about features bugs all they tell us is that they are working on the lag but not yet have a solution asking them if their architecture is good or not that they build a new 3d character engine just to walk in station and no more that they planned to make us big new adventures on planetswhen just that  guys again we dont listen to you yeay

anyone whos not supporting this topic is either pussies in pvp that are way to scared to pvp without 4368048765497 neutral rr alts behind your ass that can just instadock if it doesnt go your waywhen someone starts a war that are between 2 corps  alliances then that war is only between them and no one else but if some neutral rr alts want to help some of those 2 corpses  alliances then that neutral rr alts is going in between those 2 corpses  alliances and are going into their business  war and need to get punished for itsimply because the war between the 2 corps  alliances is something that the neutral rr alt shouldnt have anything to do with because hes not a part of those 2 corpses  alliancesso this topic is 100 supportededit the rr mechanics doesnt really need to be changed in 00 space though because as things are there when its about rring its pretty good as it is nowneutral rr alts in empire with no risks is the real problem here
not supported its bad enough flying logis already getting aggro for repping too would just be plain retarted if neutral alts upset you stop camping jita and go to npc 00 or something and camp stations there instead
do you even know what an empire war decing corp is all about
perfect summation of what is needed except there was one thing missingplease make couriers have a bigger and separate contract numbers impact a limitation to outstanding transport orders is ed limit on contracts should be on autctions and item exchange etc if any not on something that is key to developing a good shipping business
troll alt alert  peve is considered a mature  adult game so everything which would logically exist in mature and adult fantasys and dreams and sexual stuff should be able to get presented in eve as well if you dont like to see it close your eyes and gtfo period
i agree with you these gallenteans are completely depraved  join the empire and fight these sinners for your redemption burn the infidels

megathrons and rokh with large railgun works very wellferox and any ships with medium railgun works terriblea boost to railgun is good but just the medium one please
thats why fleet composition is moving towards the apoc right because theyre scared of being too op with the once standard fleet ship the megathron and the once premier sniper ship the rokh nobody wants to be unfair to their enemies by using so many railguns which work very wellseriously though railguns work fairly poorly to ok in theory but fare even worse in practice when average fleet ranges t2 ammo lock limit alpha cap use ammo use are all taken into effectscrolling through a random killboard tells the tale quite effectively where there are 15 amaar bs there were merely 6 megathrons and 2 rokhs so in spite of hybrids representing 50 of eves races and more still of the actual population there were little better then half as many of their turret boats fielded those who flew dominixes chose to fit drone mods rr and in one case medium autocannons and hyperions were nowhere to be seenrails arent fine and i hope to see them fixed and given some competitive role soon
yep boost those rails

4 pirate faction ships and items become illegal in hisec so whilest usable in hisec become available only through the black marketdont like this at alli dont support your good ideas just because of this one
it is my impression that lowsec is intentionaly excluded from developing by ccp not much ppl live here those that do obviously dont matte much to devs low sec is a place for supreme most finest pvp where low sec does not have a lot to offer except pvp and that is why it is so emptymove all the lvl4 agents in low sec you will get a baby boom heredo you realy not see what youve done there that one post basically sums up why lowsec has received such little attention and will continue to do so untill a fundamental change in game play occurs by many peopleall you are wanting to do is for ccp to drag more targets kicking and screaming out of high sec and under your gunsprediction 1 for you mynxee  if your next few months of work is going to be aimed at achieving nothing more than dragging more targets into lowsec for 13 year old mental or physical so called outlaws to shoot at then you are wasting your time as ccp neither will or should do soif your serious about making lowsec into what it should be a number of so called styles of gameplay are going to have to not so much be weeded out as modified

i think it would be epic if you could buy a plex and cash it in for issues of eon or similar items in the eve storeso you paid postage onlyideally opening for more items for plex in the store would be awesome but at least eon which is kind of a hot seller would be viable within ccp budget loss wisethe pr value alone would make up for a lot of the potential losssince the rl money have already been injected into ccp giving back to the community this way would be nice ofc maybe only one of each issue bound to each account would be a way to limit this in regards to abuseups wrong tab please move to assembly hall

i have been in nullsecurity all my eve time from the moment my character was created i have seen all capital ships in game and all of them have this bugmake them much much bigger it sucks to look at a hyperion and see that it is the same size as a thanatos capital same goes for titans when i heard titans i thought they were gonna be in the size like hundreds of kilometres i got completely dissapointedso a good idea is to make carriers a little smaller than titans supercapitals a little bigger than titans and titans about 150km is ok in my opinionwho supports the idea if you got a better suggestion go ahead
i think there is another thread similar to this onehmmm yes for the size no for the orderbattleship  dreadnaughts  carriers  motherships  titans
be aware that titans still need to fit inside pos shieldsi think the size of titans is fine as it is it is carrierssuppercarriers that need a slight boost dreadnaughts are fine too
this
er to be fair titans already are pretty massive compared to everything else comparison chart
titans are definitely big enough the only thing that comes close to dwarfing a titan is celestial bodies and space both of which should always be much larger then the ships in gamethat said i wouldnt oppose some increases in size for carriers though and perhaps motherships both with the capacity to carry battleships but neither particularly looking like it
why maybe they shouldnt be allowed to fit inside a posanyways i think titans are okbut chimera its only 15k long wtfffff
we all know the bounty system is flawed and ther have been numerous options discussed on how to fix it i had a little idea about what could be done to fix the problem and provide a new careerchange the bounty office so you can accept a mission to collect a bounty these missions have a 1 week time limit on themwhen you accept a bounty you will be given a character that has a bounty on their headwhat character will depend on a few factors1 the region you are in2 the amount of bounty on their head3 your security statusyou will only receive a mission for a character that is located within the region you are currently in and is currently online should they log off you will have added them to contacts anyway and will find out when on a mission you can use the bounty office anywhere to run a locator on the character for an amount of iskin order to get you a target the system looks at the bounties of all the characters with a bounty currently located in your region and then works out a bounty level for each character based on how much the bounty is less bounty  lower level more bounty  higher level im sure theres a mathematical term for what im describing but i dont know it if your security status is 00 you can only accept bounties for the bottom 1 of the bounties as your security rating increases so does the level of bounty mission you will be offered you can accept any bounty mission below that level and can accept multiple bounty missions at once the amount could be based on a skill to a maximum of 5if your sec status i below 20 then you wont be able to accept bounty missions sorry pirates when hunting for a bounty you can do so in a fleet and the rewards will be split evenly across your fleet in the same way regular missions do now check box when you hand in the mission at the nearest bounty officethe rewards for completing a bounty are a large increase in security status and the bounty itself plus you killed a guy and would obviously loot his wreck and salvagewhen you are on a bounty mission you are free to kill that character in any system in evethe same character could have several people with bounty missions searching for him once a characters bounty is collected the other missions are deemed to have failed but there are no negative repercussions other than you wasted a bit of time because your not a very good bounty hunteri think this mechanic would solve a few issues with the current bounty system offer a new career for players and corporations and would provide a fix for the no advantage to high security status it would also make it very difficult for a player to simply pod himself with an altin order for this system to work and be profitable for bounty hunters there would need to be a minimum bounty that can be set on a player dont know how much though id say 5 million isk for the initial bounty would make being a bounty hunter worthwhileif any one has any comments id love to hear them and if you spot any massive holes or flawy in the system point them out so everyone can see and critique it constructivly
when you are on a bounty mission you are free to kill that character in any system in evethe same character could have several people with bounty missions searching for himthis just adds more killrights without any warningthe person being chased should be able to know who are chasing him
doesnt solve the fundamental problem of bounties  a person with bounty on their head could still get a friend or an alt to kill them and claim the bounty for themselvesinstead your idea introduces another problem  i see a freighter on ap through highsec lets put 5000 isk bounty on him and go gank him
like the ideapeople can see if they have a bounty on theyr head and maybe can get a message if a bountyhunter is after themabout the thing with a friend killing you maybe you can solve the problem with a small change only a part of the bounty is paid when a bountyhunter kills the target and the rest is used for a second or third mission based on the total bounty cause of the fact that the bountyhuntermissions are created with a random factor of who is the target and how high the bounty is you have to do some work to get all the bounty on your headhavent used bountysystem since ages isnt it so that the target has to have a secstate of 25 or lower to even get a bounty on his head so normal freighter pilots would be saveif it becomes to profitable for the bountyhunters maybe a bountyhunter license can be introduced that has a monthly cost like sov and only if you have one you can accept those missions
oh yeah the idea of this is that only the person that has the mission will receive the bounty when they kill the target the eve system knows who kills who killmails so is easy enough to checkthe person with the bounty should not be informed if people are after them they should know they might be chased down at any moment the freighter thingy would not really work how many freighter pilots do you know who are neg25 sec and as the bounty missions are selected at random from a pot there is no garauntee youll get the chance to kill them
i kind of like this ideathe fact that getting the mission will pick a random pilot for bountybut i would put it anywhere in eve though locator agents will be able to determine the region heshe is in and if he is in the region then the agent will give constelation all the way to system location also possible have teh same level system as regular agent missions you get agentcorp standings and when they reach certain point then higher value bounty may be accesedand a person with a bounty should not have any idea if someone has his mission or not to put more umpf into it i would add more than 1 person may take the same missionproblem 1 i can purposely fail a mission to get new targets until i get my main toon and then kill him and claim the bounty on myselfproblem 2 what if the target is in your corpalliancecoalitionfactionnote it should be fine if someone places a bounty on anyone they want though a minimum price has to be place and not something any mr nooblet rookieplayer can pull out of their arse somehting like 10 million minimumits the begining of a new idea i like it ill support it
i think same region would work best if the guy is in wh or in 00 its gonna be way too difficult to track him down get yourself  your fleet into the area without getting your ass handed to you that was the idea bounties are selected at random so it is possible for more than one person to get the same characterit kinda is the same but instead of standings it uses security status to determine which bounties you can access the higher your sec status the higher the bounty you get24 hour timer on when you can view a bounty mission and you train a skill that enables you to have more than one concurrent mission at a time max 5 after 24 hours you can decline the mission and get a new one 24 hours should give you plenty of time to search the killboards and forums to see where your target is what ships they fly etcyou can decline one mission a day without losing anythingif you want to decline another mission in that same day you have to pay the bounty office some isk as a finders fee to the bounty office if you complete a bounty then the finders fee is deducted from the amount you receive this amount could be reduced by training a skill means you can decline a really difficult target without losing isk but stops any spamming also its kinda how a bounty office really workswell you might not be the only person looking for him you can either choose to help your corpmate and guard him kinda like harboring a criminal or you and a few buddies can go out and kill him anyway and get the bounty you bunch of backstabbing bastardsits a sandbox after all
i still thin all of eve would be better since all people with bounty would have to do is go out deep into low sec or worse 00 within their alliances so bounty hunters would need to pick a bounty office in a station they cant get into due to being red to that 00 zone having the mission all around eve randomly you might end up with a 00 pilot and now it becomes a corporation mission or an alliance bh op as for wormholes well thats just impossible to even track let alone find them so mission agents would ignore wh space pilots at the time they pick the mission
yes a player with a large bounty could run to 00 to hide from the law after all 00 is lawless space if they venture back into high sec 01  10 for whatever reason they will immediatly be back in the system easily trackable and potentially have a bounty mission assigned to them the riskreward system will apply here as there is more risk in 00 and the reward is more isk from ratting and protection from bounty missions the risks are that 00 is gheye ie 01  10 i do see your point but i believe bounties should only be a game mechanic that applies to policed space

please explain this an aeon will still get around 60mil ehp tops a nyx will still do 10000 dps tops the difference is that motherships wont be effective against smaller ships like battle cruisers and cruisers thats a balance that this game needs
the nerf might be going a bit too far but i generally agree with all 4 pointsalso we shall call them assault carriers
as a pilot flying about with an absurd amount of motherships being fielded constantly maybe you could make them less feasible in some way i mean as of now they flatten anything and cant be tackled by poses incap pos mods in 2 minutes and are nearly invincible to dds but you are basically making them useless again and i dont know if we should do that
its very easy to make that statement without backing it up but as of now its only a statement please explain how they become useless after this change based on your logic they will still flatten pos mods still be nearly invincible to dd after change an aeon would tank 20 dd a nyx about 15 yet they cant just flatten anything that moves only large objects wo fighters which means they can be tackled more easilyremoving rr adds another vulnerability removing 25 of their hp buffer adds yet another vulnerability if anything you just talked yourself right out of your own argument
totally not supported
so two people in this thread have now claimed that this would nerf them into uselessness and im just not seeing it could someone elaborate pleasethey would still be the same anticapital offensive powerhouses that they presently are and that was their intended purpose after allthey would be less effective against battleships and smaller but so what they would still be far from helpless against those ships and this would adhere to the no solopwnmobiles rule anyway there are a lot of other ships that are already very good at taking out bs and smaller ships  theres no good reason a mom should supercede them allthey would have a bit less hp i actually think 25 is probably a bit severe i would go for a much more conservative number  1015 maybe  to startthey would actually depend on carriers for remote repping ohingnoes people would have to field mixed fleets instead of saying hmm what else should we bring i know  moar moms the humanity
yeah drones should get a separate bay on both carriers i think youre being a bit too restrictive on their drone use though sure it may be aggravating to have 20 warrior iis on your tail but all it takes is 3 dominix to outdo the supercarrier in that role all in all im against taking away the utility of these tertiary capabilities in being able to carry flights of most of the major drone typesi simply dont agree with this supercarriers are in the new change much more focused on attack over other roles given that even fighters can find difficulty with small targets i dont see their presence as a problem that said removing the damage bonus applied to fighters might be a better ideayes ever since supercarriers shifted into the heavy capital attack role these rr bonuses have felt misplaced and disruptive to balance id go as far as to say stripping the range bonus from all supercarriers and replacing the hels bonus to rr with perhaps a figtherfighterbomber speed increase should help restore some balance among these ships im not convinced that this is necessary in a world with dds and other supercarriers it might prove so in the fullness of time but this strikes me as a potential bridge too far that would relegate supercarriers back to the expensive toy role they had for so longthe speed increase while appropriately themed would likely need to be thought through pretty well to make it powerful enough compared to the nyxs damage bonus and the wyvernaeons resist bonus while not making it possible for say a speed hac to get near a hel and live to tell the tale
you sir are an idiot
this 
need to be able to war dec a player causing you grief from an npc corp
1 point my own postnobody should be immune to the rest of eve rules
sorry but there are cons to being in an npc corp first your entire corp doesnt get kill rights for people stealing stuff and blowing you up second you dont communicate among other members very easily also would this be your entire corp against this one person that would be overkill
if we were allowed to wd npc corps all the pirates would be bbqing noobs and freighter pilots all day noobs need a safe haven to leanr how to play the game if their bot corp gets decced well picture thisgame instalment completesign inundockboomemoragequitcongrats you have just driven yet another player away form the game i hope you enjoy your epic kill board filled with velator kills and your now sizable epeen have a nice day
htfu
i cannot support this as well
norequesting to change play style that you personally dont likeuse is selfish
yes on the conditions that it fits into existing eve mechanicslore which means two thingsdec the faction npc corp belongs to being shot by empireconcord involvement on empires side as private decs against empire is not covered by treaty exception fwwhy did you think eves mechanics and backstory should be altered for your convenience well have fun
ok  i can see your point about new playerswhats to prevent me from creating a new alt character podding you get my standing back up fast by mission and re pod uhow about a suggestion that if you do illegal activity in an npc corp  it boots you to a npc corp that is allowed to be war decd and doesnt let u back into the npc corpa player that cant be hunted  cant be stopped
all players can be hunted in eve thats the nature of the game it may require you to be smarter about how you do so but you can hunt them
any reason why this is limited to 5050 really isnt muchplease make so we can store morethese are really handy instead of people running around looking at forums looking for setups they can use this toolwhich is great but its just annoying that its limited to 50not sure on how many should be limited but lets say at least 300
i dont see any use for this other than repping anchorable modules that already have too much hp for gang warfare it would be utterly useless and an enormous nerf to an otherwise useful ship classim actually rather partial to the idea of micro triage and siege modules  eliminating movement makes for much less communication during a fleet fightliang
liang well the 25minute cycle time would make it quite easy to coast in and out of triage and hope the opponent doesnt sees iti am quite sure the op wants more repping power for the armor hac gangs but they are powerful enough as isno need to buff them more
actually the negative effects that were created were explicitly to prevent the armor hac gang buff i do however want to create an inroad to removing rr bonuses from carriers that do not triage
why are rr bonuses on logistic orientated ships like carriers bad so you want every carrier that wants to give decent rr to go into triagethat sounds a bit suicidal for many situations this would especially fire back when you want to repair sov structurespossesoutposts atm you got the choice to use the normal rr bonuses and rep things up eg when the surrounding systems are too hot or go all in and triagethen you would be forced to triage to get anything done sounds useful not really
ok obviously you havent thought through your whole statement if logistics ships replace carriers in that role of pos repair with limited risk why would carriers bother even trying to repair a tower out of triage a logistics ship in triage with 4 large armor repairers with the above bonuses would do the following4 x 384  1536 repair2304 x 250  384045 seconds t2  25  18384018  2123 repairs or 1280000 hp per 10 minor with 4 medium reps 640000 hp per 10 minthat compared to a carrier not in triage currently with 4 repairers1500 x 4  60005 second rof60005s  1200 repairs or 720000in traige a carrier does 12000 repair every 25 seconds or 4800 repairs which is 2880000 mil hp per 10 min ie logistics do their logistical duty but carriers become the super logistic in a battlefield setting while also having the non logistical ability to project offense out of triage or a larger logistical ability if you desire to risk it on a tower repair to me sounds like a role for each rather than letting carriers spider tank and swarm with their current massive hp zomg a game of diversity and unique qualities rather than bigger is better could be something to that one
wtb guardian that can perma run 6 lrar and still has some tank a more realistic setup would be 4 maybe 5 lrar and some cap transferalso your 4 crar carrier is kind of unrealistic so if you want to do some numbers use realistic fittings and not something artificialand you dont increase the diversity with removing capabilities especially since logistic cruisers and carriers serve similar but still different roles
you cant have bombs in high sec for a very simple reason because you dont have lasting consequences for using themif using a bomb in high sec and hitting non war targets had lasting effects forcing people to think and evaluate the action before doing it i would be favorable to allowing them but the consequences should be serious permanent or at least requiring year of game time to be removed and not easily avoidable using alts similarly empires will be using cynodampers and defend them very well with static defenses and active fleets way larger than what is used in fw against enemy militia as this is a game and not a rl simulation long term consequences arent applicable it is a bad game mechanism and people leaving the game for good would not care about them similarly the heavily defended cynojammers arent applicable as players would start to cry that the game is unbalanced we cant easily kill the npc cynojammers so the limitations are necessary to keep the game viable
this is a bad idea on so many levels if you want these things there are vast regions of null sec where you can use themyou seem to want weapons of mass destruction while still hiding under concords skirtso in a way concord protection also makes you special so if we are to follow your logic through then really everything should just be 00 right
all this focus on bombing jitaif someone were to bomb jita theyd hit a lot of innocent people thatd be a lot of sec loss for that playeradd in my idea where negative toons cant be recycled or anything and suddenly people will have to grind their way back to positive standings or buy more accounts to keep playingas for the rest such as making the governments earn their sovereignty i like itsure you could wage war on the caldari in general but they pay concord for protection so not only would you be trying to take down a station and its defenses but the faction navy and concord would be shooting you in the a tooand id love to see the repercussions when a corp or alliance suddenly has aggro against the entirety of caldari space corpies and allies everywhere start taking fire because one guy decided to bomb jita
alts and the ease of recovering sec status if you have access to a patch of 00 while at the same time grinding a lot of isk and the sec status hit become meaningless the whole corpalliance getting aggro pro 1 man actiongreat way to grief a corp get a alt in with the skill to use bomb and bomb jita instant aggro in caldari space jc to rens and repeatsuicide and go to a clone in amarr and repeathow much damage you can do to a corp that way
yeah i suppose it is a bit drasticbut my point is allowing players to use ships and modules with the usual repercussions wouldnt be game breaking someone lights a cyno in jita not a crime someone jumps in a titan not a crime someone uses targeted dd on war target while extreme overkill still not a crime someone regresses servers and uses aoe dd on all traffic concord responds to crimethe point of this thread pure and simple is ccp claiming there are no special items in the game and yet instituting base code restrictions against using some items in some locationswhy cant i use a smartbomb within reach of a gate because id be damaging public property and enraging the local authorities nope because the game said so
so also  allow claiming sovernity and moon mining in wspace i want to set up an outpost and build a titan there
but theres a difference between gameplay restrictions like capitals in highsec and things to protect people from themselves which was not being able to move plex there was really no reason not to move plex but there are reasons not to be able to doomsday a freighter outside of jitai wouldnt be so against being able to move caps through highsec but i dont like the idea of them using capital weapons or modules carrier repping dreads pos bashing in highsec
if someone wants to lose a 55b isk ship to concord for a freighter kill and to watch the gannets scoop all the cargo before his alt does  what exactly is the problem eve is supposed to be a sandboxat least thats what the devs keep telling usbut it isnt because it has lots of special restrictionsits just that a lot of game features are coded in a cheap way with  you cant activate that module here  type restrictionsthese types of restirctions should be a last resort if nothing else is possiblecynos for examplecynos should be activatable in high secif its a crime and you get concordokken for it fair enough but blah blah blah im not programmed to activate here because of the jita treaty of 21342 or whatever the message is  is just cheap nasty easiest fit solution
well there is an esy fix for this that would take all of 3 minutes to fix change the jita treaty of 21342 fluff to this system is cynojammed all i see in this thread is  im scared to use all these things in 00 cause the big mean 00 players will kill me so can i please use this stuff on noobs in empire please

delilahi dont really consider griefing to be much of an issue in games like eve i have never felt griefed in such games and that includes the likes of shadowbane and darkfall specifically targeted and hassled yes but if it remains within the context of the game i just dont consider it griefing people that take things beyond the legitimate context of the game such as cheating or trying to harm people outside of the game in the real world is another matter but those things are already sanctioned by terms of service and rl lawsvenkul and his like are not making an important point about the diversity of eve what he is doing is trying to justify themepark type game play as if its some legitimate playstyle that should be catered to in a sandbox type game he claims to be interested in the market and industry well none of my ideas would stop those legitimate activities yet he still strongly objects and laments the evils of pirates for which he seems to have a serious grudge high sec would still be the principle market of eve and a sound place to engage in industry outside of capital ship building and drug manufacture its isk faucets like missions that i have a problem with being in high sec not trade and industry i specifically object to combat missions on the basis that one it creates a risk imbalance vs nullsec and lowsec and two that it makes no sense in context of the games lore and other mechanics reds not being able to operate in high sec lastly no other sandbox mmo that also claimed to be a pvp orientated game has this sort of dynamic of safe zones to pve in it would be like shadowbane or darkfall moving half their mobs inside the npc cities which is just bizarrein a game like eve there shouldnt be any strictly pve without pvp factoring in to some degree as well pve already factors into all pvp activities the very idea that we have pve over here in this portion of the game and pvp over there and the two dont directly mix is by its very nature a themepark game concept harking back to the infamous changes in uo through to eq wow and beyond if we dont agree on this delilah were not nearly as close in positions as you seem to thinkpull push buff nerf it all amounts to the same thing when your playing a game where everything is supposed to effect everything else its like those posts people make about ship balance oh you should buff these weak ships rather than nerf these op ships it would be so much better power is relative so in the end its pretty much the same same thing low sec doesnt need a boost the whole dynamics of the game needs a complete work over the problems with low sec are a symptom of the real illness infecting the game as a whole to get a cure you dont treat the symptoms you treat the illnessas to your specific question about me since recently returning to eve i do not spend time in low sec other than passing through i see little point in being there i split my time between nullsec mostly npc controlled and high secoh and while we might not agree nothing you have posted in this thread thus far is trollish as was suggested above and your posts make for far more interesting reading than the majority of trash that fills these forums so go ahead and write that essay p

firstly let me say fully supportedsecondly i feel this may also spur the sale of cheap keyboards good or bad doesnt matter just safapyinon a slightly more serious note though this sort of content may be pushing it a bit far note i fully support this however having at some some sort of additional humor  suggestivity would not be a bad thing this game is an adults game it takes thought patients and creativity to play it well and be able to enjoy itto an extent this sort of content already exists in game see minmatar outpost those hubs in missions but should certainly be added to the legal ramifications to this are huge  i highly doubt ccp would legally be able to do this certainly not in the states because our country is rather fail but probably elsewhere i think that the way around this would be to give the game an m rating which is totally doable but keep in mind that that would significantly decrease the sales of the game its just a fact look at trends the next issue would be dealing with the existing 18 year olds  how would this be dealt with  if the age on the account you needed to put your age in when you registered is 18 no adult content shown if age 18 make it an option settings even put a pw on itagain though this would roll right back to ccp sales and ultimately like anything its about money in that case pay for the adult upgrade if you meet certain conditions p for this ccp add in futanari do it damnit

if someones behavior on the forums annoys you the best way to handle it is to simply ignore them professional trolls are desperate attention ws if you refuse to feed them they will go awayfrom a practical perspective first of all if you ban a troll hell just come back with a different alt or account and second where do you draw the line and who decides whos crossed itfree speech isnt free you pay for it by having to occasionally deal with speech you find offensive
freedom of speech doesnt apply in a companys private forums and do you seriously think he will set up another subscribed account just to troll

this is important and needs to be in the game
supported they could also become an offensive module if loaded with red tape
i heard if you salvage a ragnarok you get 2075625000 kg worth of metal scraps
ive suggested this before as well its a great idea plex are worth real money so why cant we cash them out on other ccp products itd make sense and ccp would make a bit of money they had been missing out on before
it would also be a good way of testing general closed economy marketselling immaterial content like pdfs of eve content or maybe even other ccp produts like whitewolfwod a model like this could pay for some awesome work on making eve backstory player manuals and similarmight even want to add services similar to apple apps store where player created immaterial content could be traded for plexisk only usable for other evewod related contentnot sure how edgy that would be to the eula as it stands but since we are already trading player created content for isk it should be in the clear
i believe this is why reverse redeem was originally introduced but it never fully came to fruition id be interested to see it work
id like that 1
arent ccp shipping fees known for being more than little unreasonable pl
plex is worth real money to us but to ccp its just isk out no cash in publications especially magazines have very small profit margins because of the cost of production you have to pay writers designers editors etc then pay for the actual cost of materials call a local printer ask them how much it would cost to print a book of the same dimensionspage numbers it would be a bad business move on ccps part and would mean less money going towards the game itself
id disagree plex for eon mag would mean more subscribers to the mag from people that otherwise wouldnt shell real cash for the mag but have plenty of isk lying around and possibly would get a kick from seeing an irl tangible gain from their internet spaceships empire eon gets their money either way assuming ccp is fair with their accounting
i believe you should post this idea at the assembly hall you have my support there is a proposal for allowing payment in plex for facelifts  character exchangescombining your idea with the above makes more sense in your plex as payment proposalccp already charges an extra 25 usdeuro for each month worth of game time so it will be basically converting 175 into a 15 coupon that can be traded within the market no loss for ccp whatsoever
plex  rw money is a one way transactionwhen people buy plex with rw money and sell it in game ccp makes money people that wouldnt pay to play the game in effect are having someone else pay for them to playif you could sell plex for rw money or trade it for other things of value like store items or eon mag then ccp loses money because that is plex that wont be used to to pay for the account of someone that otherwise wouldnt pay this is why ccp spends so much time going after out of game isk sellers could you imagine the black market in these things if you could swap plex for them someone with 20 macro accounts fully funded on plex swaps his 100 extra plex a month for 50 copies of eon and then goes into business reselling those magazines for a price under ccps price 3 plex for a tshirt and suddenly ccp cant sell any for real money as all the macros are fighting each other to to have the largest discount all cuts into ccp profits
i dont see how its different for real life merchandices if someone buys a merchandive with plexes it means that somebody has already paied for the price of the product and the shipping cost by injecting plexes to the market nope paying subscriptions and paying for merchandices are two different markets its the plex itself that matters not how its used in terms of game play hence the plexblowingup changes this is why ccp spends so much time going after out of game isk sellersyou said that for yourselfoh by the way what makes you think other players with plexes will buy from black market traders who will certainly ask for real life money no matter how much the discount rate isedit typo
its too bad that they wouldnt distribute pdfs because the prevalence of piracyalso if people could get eon for plex wed see a big increase in the isk price as itd be a demand shock we also might see an increase in purchased plexs as the suppliers could get more isk for their dollars overall id think itd be a good idea for ccp but the people who buy plex for game time and only that wont like it too much
ccps whole point is that plex is an in game item and is treated as such they recently made them moveable etc to further dedifferentiate plex from other in game items i strongly suspect that this is fueled by legal concernsi would be incredibly surprised if they expanded the use of plex beyond being usable to purchase gametime because then plex is being used as a currency to purchase a good a magazine youd have all kinds of potential tax implications i feel quite confident in predicting wont happen ever
they accepted plex for fanfest tickets which theoretically had a real money value as well not the exact same but it seems pretty closeid buy plexes and trade them in for eon magazines i havent had any desire to spend out of game currency but have isk to spare and it seems like everyone benefits ccp gains more revenue people selling plexes get more bang for their buck as prices would rise a bit and people with lots of isk get a mag they might not otherwise get who is the loser in this
and you could add a layer more in regards to pdfs of say wod books and eve books plex or piracy i think plex is a better choice for ccp and playersjust saying this is a potentially huge market and a big step in the development of virtual currenciesto mention an example i believe ccp by proxy now owns the rights to all the old wod books i have a nice collection but a few holes if the price was right since this is a discontinued product i would use virtual currency to buy these pdfs instead of trying to get them through secondhand or piracy i get high quality scans and creator gets paid indirectly everyone winsoh and i know i would buy pdfs of the eon magazine if those were sold say 3 for one plex if hooked then also the full backissue collection of the hardcopies
a larger gaming population doesnt even know what the eon mag is im confident to bet my man gonads on that piece of infoso having them available for plex could certainly boost player awareness and mag purchase ingameand yes tax implications and issues can arise out of it
they should just make eon available as a digital download then id actually pay real money for it having to actually have paper delivered to my house and taking up room is kind of immersion breaking for a scifi game set millenia in the future its a bit pathetic in this day and age really i will never ever subscribe to a physical copy id subscribe immediately if it was dig download on a pad style device it would be perfect

i dont think anything will really stop macros but what might limit their effect is to make mining interactive rather then passivethere has been countless ideas to improve mining and remove macros none of which ccp have really initiated theyve added better belts to exploration so active participants get higher grade ores in highsec but that doesnt really stop the macros from doing what they are doing or lower their impact probably the best idea ive heard was one from a fellow corp mate and long time buddy the idea is to keep mining exactly the same as it is now but you have an option to enhance your yield by interacting directly with the mining process itself he used tetris as an example of how interactive mining would workbasically the mining laser or group of lasers has an option on it to manual operation when selected you are given a window which shows the ore currently entering in the mining lasers capacitor before dumping into the cargo hold the shapes of ore pieces are random shapes and sizes and they all come in the very center of the capacitor if you do nothing you actually lose efficiency then letting the computer do the sorting which is what happens when you dont perform manual operation so going into the manual mode you have to interact otherwise youre yield is less then normal modehowever in manual mode you are given the options to move or trash the piece of ore the lasers have brought in youll have 10 seconds to place the ore but you can move any ore anywhere in the capacitor or even trash pieces making room for better fitting pieces basically you are sorting out the ore to take up the lest amount of space possible like i said the ore pieces are different shapes and size once its full it auto dumps into the cargo hold at the end of the mining lasers cycle it dumps whatever is in the capacitor into the cargo hold note that i said  autodump not manual dump i thought the same thing but my buddy made a great point why would a macro not just go manual mode and dump into cargo every 10 seconds they get maximum ore that way the alternative he had was was very similar only change was once the capacitor gets to the amount of ore a cycle would normally produce in automatic mode it dumpsthe idea for that was the capacitor for the group of mining lasers is more then the mining lasers produce for example lets say a hulk with skills produces 3000m3 of ore well the capacitor on the same hulk is say 5000m3 this gives the manual operation the ability to produce up to 5000m3 per cycle but he added more later saying that once its full it dumps and the ore keeps coming in this means if youre really good at sorting the ore pieces you could get over 5000m3 before the lasers autodump the capacitor and start again on a new cycle so if youre lucky and got really big pieces that took up a lot of room and you hit the 5000m3 capacity it would dump and start againhe wanted to make it so if a macro chooses manual operation and does nothing they actually lose out and it might only have 1000m3 in the capacitor at the end of the cycle so he thought the ore pieces would have a little generic physics like dropping decent sides rocks into a bucket if you have the ability to real time sort the rocks going into the bucket and move current rocks in there youll hold a lot more rocks if you do nothing the rocks basically fall where they fall eventually filling the bucket and any more rocks being added simply fall out of the buckethe never proposed it on the forum because while it would make mining more fun and rewarding for the active player without effecting the macros the programing of this idea is significant and balancing would be very difficult you could have an army of people performing manual mining which would crash prices as everyone is mining more along with the current macro contribution
i somewhat like the ideacause it bothers the heck outa me sitting in a roid belt and a ship warps in  and starts mining the same rocks as you do you try to conversation them and no reply totally tell who is a macro and who is notid give it a try to see if this works
im terrible at tetris though panother idea manually aiming your lasers and in a similar way to how your planetary interaction extractor rate is affected by the abundance of a material at a certain location if you manually train your lasers on hotspot onboard scanner finds most survey scanner finds better ones on the asteroid your yield will be higher as the asteroids rotate you lose lineofsight with the hotspots and have to shift the lasers or you could just aim them at the centre of the roid go afk and get a third of the current yieldmight make it more annoying but could make it a little more challenging and require more brains to do spice it up by having the asteroids break apart occassionally crash into each other whatever
as one who runs missions in lowsec every now and then since i live there and used to in highsec when i lived there i feel i have the necessary background to propose a few improvements 1 make missions in lowsec give payout and loyalty points equal of 01 sec or 001 true sec this includes missions given from highsec agents with a destination in lowsec this will also make several more agents in lowsec actually worth the trouble 04 and 03 agents and such are worthless due to the tiny increase in rewards compared to 05 2 more agents spread around lowsec just a few hubs is too little suggesting most placed in places not used very much in order to spread people more out as well as making new areas to populate and thus also force pirates to move around more every constellation in lowsec should imo have lvl 1 to lvl 4 agents 3 more lvl 5 agents there are far to few options of where to run them just a minor increase needed also spread them out caldari and minmatar have several packed into a single constellation 4 idea by slimy worm lowsec and 00 have a higher bounty pool to choose from to reflect a stronger pirate presence and also give more of a reward for the pvp risk example high sec 500k bounties lowsec 950k bounties 00 12m bounties 5 something for the future sub pirate factions more of them thukker has one system where they have lowsec lvl 4s sister of eve the same if i recall correctly where are mordus the society etc more unique lp stores like faction warfare in lowsec where is faction carriersdreadnaughts or something else unique make people want to be there im in lowsec for pvp and well paid missions well actually only if youre in 02 and 01 really which sucks that enables me to pvp more people go there for different reasons last qen we saw lowsec is actually loosing population and being the 2nd lowest populated area in eve behind wormhole space the proposals above i believe will draw more people to lowsec for different reasons the reason i propose this is because many pvpers i know originally went to lowsec for the better paying agents but after a little while got drawn into the pvp aspect of the game that even includes several corporations as well the problem most of lowsec sucks so most looking into lowsec see its hardly worth the move from 05 to 04 and leave the above will hopefully prevent that and lowsec nature will eventually draft almost all into pvp sooner or later i know lowsec needs far more than that trust me ive lived there for soon 3 years but you gotta start somewhere the next step would be 610 plexes in lowsec along with a few other exploration tweaks and then something for the miners most people tend to stick around when you get them far out into 0102 and i am therefore sure if you make all of lowsec like that that far more people will stick around in lowsec remember to check the support if you agree with my proposals
apparently one cant support ones first post supporting with this one then
i support this bounties for the same rat need to be higher if the rat is in nulllow than if the rat is in high that would reward people who get sent by a highsec agent to lowsec plus it would make rat bounties somewhat dependent on the risk to pvp not just on the difficulty of the npc excluding playerdriven factors like getting attacked in your mission
what about having a infrastructure upgrade which costs isk every month for a ihub to put a shield around it so that it cant be attacked by fighters or fighter bombers instead you have to bring in battleships or dreadsthis will remove a role from scs and return it to dreads instead of sieging ihubs with impunity in a super carrier you have to use dreads
damn  missed this when there was still time to vote
i dont know if its ever been brought up but would love the option of doing overview settings and drone grouping in station
the title is pretty self explanatory why should only ceos have the ability to receive mail when a new application is in sometimes recruiters dont check the applications window everyday and it would be much much better if they were sent a mail each time an application was sent just like a ceo doesanother thing this does is free up a bit more the directors by having new recruits have to actually go through the chain of commandjust another little improvement to the whole corporation roles system that i think everyone would benefit from
oh please no id cry if this went through
yeah you bet
oh pleasemake it so ccp its so easy to do it
i for one support my idea
yeah that sounds fing good
he wont leave us alone till we support it xahara aggro
please oh please do it we wont have any peace in corp chat until then
the idea sucks but to keep him quiet
support it makes sense
i believe anyone with shares gets a message executives also get messages about new members and if you read the article about corp recruitment he says that you should make your recruiters executives
thats wrong mate im a recruiter and have shares and i get no mailsalso we shouldnt be obligated to make recruiters directors recruiters are one thing directors are another
galvatine its gonna take a lot more than a simple belief to actually validate another one of your fail proposals seeing as how ure stating that u want low sec pirates to be excluded from being bounty heads and uve already agreed its not gonna be profitable or worthwhile in low sec in your previous proposal as well and thats why it failedin case u havent figured it out if u really want a working bounty system make it work outside high sec so that maybe your proposal isnt just the result of your high sec piracy whining and if u really dont and its already quite obvious u dont and just wanna be even safer either exercise your kill rights yourself by training your alt and quit wasting other ppls time or deal with the consequences of hiding behind a carebear alt trolling removed zymurgist
this post has got nothing to do with me hell i dont even agree with parts of it i know its someone proposing something that might affect you in some way though so clearly your going to have a good old whine about itfor the benefit of those that didnt see it first time round
no i understand them theyre just crap
the ability to neutrally remote rep ships should be limited to 1 neutral ship multiple neutral remote repping ships basically render all high security space war decs invalid as any corp or alliance could gather any neutrals to rep themi understand the need for neutrals to rep each other from time to time from missions etc however the basic fact that any small neutral corporation can render themselves invulnerable to a sizeable fleet should be considered an interference with the basic high sec mechanics of the game wars should be fought against those involved in the war dec and the wardec only those wishing to take informal alliances into combat should do so in lownull sec space
yes neutral repping is quite annoyingsimple solution would be that just like certain acts start an agression timer repping someone would start a 15min assistance timer during this time if the guy you helping is at war with someone so are you
the damage bonus is built into the fighter skill not the ships that would be a much harder fix fighters hit smaller ships quite well actually there are ways to fight around it but not many another way of solving the problem is to change the skill of motherships to 3 fighterbombers per level but only 1 fighter per level ie they do carrier dps with fighters but still insane dps with bombersif you gave the hel the said bonus all motherships could still fit upwards of 4060 mil ehp tanks fully bonused do the math thats a lot of frickin hitpoints with their super high resistances due to officer gear fittings most motherships can tank about 4050k dps a second per triage carrier meaning it takes about 2025 seconds to add another mil hp per triage carrier
i like the idea of a dedicated bay for fightersbombers but i strongly dislike the idea of such a small drone bay and limiting the number of drones they can field in that way the reason everyones migrating to motherships is because theyre pretty cheap they put out omgwtfbbq dps to absolutely everything this by itself completely destroys the utility of every regular capital theyre ewar immune this means you cant jam their point off and unless you happen to have a pretty enormous number of hics on titan bridge standby you arent gonna kill iti didnt want a hel anyway also5 remove ewar immunity in low sec from all supercapitals6 unable to deployuse any special supercapital weapon in low sec titan bridges are special weaponstake your 00 sov tools back to 00 where they belong dammit just sayinliang
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhwaaahhhhhhhhhhhwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhthis is what i took from it stop crying and never post again
terrible ideaalso grow a set and use your main
so you want supercarriers to be able to be destroyed by a 10 man gang lol ok1 oh great so why dont you also go ahead and remove passive shield regen so a single sabre can pop a sc great idea2 i agree to the point that any sc deployed should have a large enough support fleet behind it but to the point that you want it to be completely defenseless against any subcap fleet no matter how big is just mind blowing3completely removes the need for a carrier oh most definitely if i recall ccp already took care of that concern they took the ability to triage out of scs oh and good luck deploying scs without triage support4 ok i rest my case so its not enough that they have to be defenseless they also have to be paper thin essentially the ship youre looking for is a dreadnought let me explain they are defenseless against subcaps theyre paper thin and can only hit capital ships might aswell go ahead and lower the price of scs to about 3 bil rightneedless to say you get no support from me
seriously the idiocy behind every one of these statements is mindblowing i would respond to each one normally but theyre so pathetically horrible that its self explanatory what my responses would be
im down see xaharas post please think your ideas out before you post them scs are supercapitals i agree that having a bigger tank than a titan see aeon and a bit broken but what youre proposing is just silly xahara  yes but a bit rudeccp scs fit their role now but i also agree that their rep bonus is rediculous ccp please reintroduce the mothership as a new ship class this would be worthwhile especially since titans are all too common now sorry for the hijackedit possable cromo effect alt p
no xahara took his comments to such an extreem that it made motherships look worthlessfighter bombers do massive damage they hurt battleships and they dominate other capitals adding in a drone bay of 500 gives any mothership the capability of launching 1 fully bay of heavy drones or 5 full waves of light drones thats a load of drones if a mothership is in crisis mode where it requires more than 1 full rack of heavy drones to get out of it then the use of heavy drones should not dictate the fight anyways thats just a terrible pilot the hp redux is marginal all it really does is put motherships more in line with titans on hp where the nyx would suffer more at the expense of more damage for their cost they shouldnt get equal or better hp than titans anyways like i said before they can still tank a  load of dd which seems to be the fear as for remote repair every 1 remote repair in a moms tank platform adds about 4500 tanks from and unjamable system of ships most motherships run 2 or 9000 hp of tank added every second that means for every additional mothership beyond 1 you would need about 15 typical fleet rr bs to outdamage their tank system or 2 dreads to match it that might sound fine but when you think about the amount of hp they have and the amount of damage they do that doesnt scale at all all your doing is breaking the tank not killing the ship when your talking 3060 mil ehp thats a lot of time or firepower beyond breaking the tank needed 15 bs are dead in about 34 minutes from 2 motherships and its about the same for dreads all removing the rr of moms does is add a vulnerabilty that carriers which are jamable actually have to fill the void on they still have a massive hp buffer wo any repair with the new stats it would still take about 13 dreads a full 10 minute cycle of unrepaired damage wo dieing lol against motherships not going to happen just to kill 1 nyx the default weakest tank how in gods name is that unfair thats a reasonable statistic and god for ing bid a mom should ever fit a local repairer or 2 ever again as for xaharas totally defenseless remark i mean wtf would ccp be thinking asking a ship to maybe actively tank something
the whole purpose of an sc is to be its own fleet the name of the shipclass says it all  super carrier  it should be its own fleet this means 20 dronesfighterswhat ever this also implies a massive drone bay which it has it fits its own role quite well regardless of wether you use fbs or fighters against a battle ship  its doomed fighters usually do more damage to a bs anyway unless you target paint it i do agree to some extent having a tank as large as a titans is a bit broken but as a massive dps ship that is its own fleet it should have a massive tank the role i agree should be reevaluated but for its price tag it should have a tank similar not bigger or equal but similar to a titans keep in mind that it can not fit dds or jpgs  that alone makes the difference worth while cost wise a carrier in triage is immune to jamming as xahara said gl successfully deplying scs without carrier support titans too for that matter
what do you expect to counter 20 supercarriersliang
my propasal is to reward everyone that plays the game by wanting to speed up learning by creating temporary implants that would speed up learning by 1 to 10  for a limited skill point amount one creating a separate special implant slot only for these implants have them npc sold and restrict the number each account can have till they are used up
not supportedwhile i am slowly coming around to the idea that learning skills are borked and could be done away with these implants will become just as mandatory if you plan to keep up with the joneses
not supported we already have implants to speed up learning
i would like it if players could construct arenas it would add something to industry they could have sentry guns fire on anyone that tried to interupt the match in question or add ecm towers these things would make it more expensive and it would add to industry i wouldnt even care if they were only allowed in low or null sec certain alliancescorps could buy the arena and have tournaemnts for profit or publicity let the players run the show and i think the arena idea is great i do agree witth the op that casual player need better access to pvp
note this is not world of warcrack this is eve  where ships cost time to fly and brains to stay alive put that in your pipe and smoke it
1autotargeter  lock all wrecks script for salvagers is a brilliant idea and it comes with the tradeoff that they have one less highslot for a salvager module
as long as the auto targeter actually works and automatically locks the correct targets id love to see this improvement
shouldnt fleet members immediately return a 100 signal strength right away seeing as you can warp to them
it would be interesting if we could set the sig id for our shipskinda like a registry number to go along with the ship name
your making this harder than it isstep 1 change the ship names to something agreed upon by the fleetstep 2 have everyone meet up in the same area away from traffic zones such as a moon or planetstep 3 have a probing ship drop a combat probe and leave it at that area at the fleet at minimum rangestep 4 scan and note the sigsstep 5 step 6 profit
this works fairly well theres really no need for the change the op is suggesting
currently the only people able to issue warp commands are the people in the various commander positions while the boss can assign those positions they cant warp the fleet on their ownthis results in the rather ridiculous situation of having the actual fc the person not the position occupying the fleet commander slot in fleet despite rarely if ever having the leadership skills to be able to provide bonuses for those below himthis causes problems when you want to start using command ships in the fleet positions because it means the fc has to give up his ability to warp the fleet in order to get the bonuses workingi see no reason why the boss shouldnt be allowed to do fleet warps without having to swap himself in and out of the fleet commander spot
hear heari would even go as far as separating the warping from the all the leadership positions and being able to assign fleetwingsquad warp roles to anyone from zero up to all the members of the respective unit sometimes you have more than one fc sometimes you dont want incompetent people who are wcs because of their trained skills to warp half of your fleet away
you can assign fleetwingsquad booster to each member of the respective unit the fc of the fleet doesnt need to be the fleet boosterjust a thought
but the fc still has to have the fleet command skill trained to be able to pass on the bonuses of the booster
the loot tables for the exploration sites if only the highsec magnetometric ones really need to have a look at by the pve team to make sure theyre still giving the same balance of reward as they originally intended when they first came outi disagree with the bit on empty cans like elenor said its chance based you have the chance of getting nothing or the chance of getting only positron cordsauxiliary parts or getting 2 decryptors worth 7m each from a single canwhat would be interesting is whether the loot drop is calculated per can or per site then distributed amongst the cans maybe someone who studied probabilitystatistics could explain how doing them either way would change the percentage chance of dropsbut all in all exploration isnt supposed to be a steady stream of income its supposed to be lots of coal with the occasional diamond that balances everything out in the long runmore sites would be nice too d i wonder how often they increase the amount of sites spawned versus the population growtheditit would be interesting if they could distribute exploration sites so that the lower a constellations population the more sites spawn there dont you just love exploring the unknown hiddens depths of space right in the middle of the forge d yes this is a stealth boost to highsec islands
supported but 1man corps that share the same channel should replace nonnoob npc corps
and make it so you can add custom tags like sniper or dps close range
i did actually screw up the math because it should have been 4 not 6 1 slot for triage mod 1 slot for cap transfer but the math is very strong still and ill fix it shortly carriers repairing towers regularly use 34 repair modules which was the comparison to refute your complaint in combat of course they do not its typically 2

hellmay i please ask about a date yet shortly means whats the point that stop the publication right now ccp dont want to tell anything about bug resolution i hope csm will give us some informationccp stop flashing us with pseudo lag dev blog please give us a backlog dev blog29 its sunday and not yet any feedback from the previous csmregardsyeay
i am currently writing and rewriting and rerewriting a csm devblog csmblog that gives some details about what happened during the release planning meetingsthe reason it is taking so long is that weve been working with ccp in order to provide as much information as possible while still staying inside their comfort zone that should be finished todaythen after i finalize the blog posting this weekend it will have to be reviewed by ccp and published hopefully this time next week though we will push for it to be expeditedwe know everyone wants to know what we think you ought to know and we think you ought to know what we know and ccp thinks they want you to know what the csm thinks you ought to knowin fact part of the reason for the delay is that we keep getting updates that go you know you might want to let the players know that
i kind of like the bounty idea
ive been reading this thread with great interest and would just like to say congrats on both sides for keeping the thread relative clean as somebody who has been actively for the past 4  5 months i will admit that i have only gone thought lowsec to get to a destination other then that i have never felt the need to go therei agree that people need to be encourage to get out of high sec and go to low sec but for that to happen then the rewards will have to be worth iti would be quite happy to see all lvl3 and lvl4 mission moved to low sec this i would believe allow new players time to learn about eve and earn sufficient isk doing lvl1 and lvl2 missions as well complexes exploration sites etc in high sec before moving onin regards to complexes exploration sites i would leave these available in high sec but lower the rewards they would be more training then anything increase the awards for them in low sec and again for nullsecby moving level 3 and level 4 mission to low sec then you will get an influx of players of course this means that there are more targets for pirates however i would hope that you would then get corps taking over low sec areas and then providing protection for a price of course for players who wish to go thereas somebody has already mentioned similar to how mafia works if you willfor me high sec should be an area where people can earn a respectful amount of isk have access to the markets learn the basics mechanics of the game such as mining low level complexes low level exploration sites etc etc
you see the mission runners will band up and defend the system dont work for several reasons to cite 2 of the most basic1 pve and pvp set up are very different 2 unless you are willing to rapidly get a negative standing you cant proactively kill the pirates most of them are smart enough not to get to 5 or less standingthis mean that generally the defender will not be capable to kill the pirate at the gates and will not be capable to secure the system and even a secured system gates can be bypassed easily enough by jumpclones or cynos what this will mean a mission runners defense force will be potentially capable of running off some pvpers but will be incapable to kill them as they will miss the basic tools warp scramblersdisruptors and webs and generally the pvpers will have already scored 1 or more kills before retreating doing missions in a pve capable ship will heavily reduce earning potential try doing a mission in a drake with a pvp fit or a blaster meghatron having a core of pvp ready players always present in system will lower again earning potential as you will need to give them something for the work they do switching to pvp ships when someone doubtful enter the system will again reduce your earning potential and probably will not be fast enough to avoid 1 or 2 mission runners kills smart pvpers would have 1 alt scanning the system in a cov ops and finding the targets before jumping in system dockingabandoning missions every time there is a probe on the directional scanner and if they are good at it the probes can be visible for a very short time will make almost impossible to do missions in 00 you can avoid or mitigate most of those problems because you can defend the gates in low sec you cant without becoming the pirate an influx of player in low sec would not mitigate the problem it will compound it as you get more and more people in a system checking who is friend or foe or neutral bystander become more difficultbeing a pirate is cool you will get plenty of them they have always been a high percentage of low sec population even when scanning you in a mission pocket was difficult and there was a sizable population of low sec mission runners and they were crying that there were too few targets even then now that it very easy if level 3 or 2 as xov suggest missions were moved to low sec you would see plenty of people flocking to low sec from 00 and high sec to kill the easy prey as i already stated to work it will require a complete redo of most of eve and leveling up the field starting a new fresh server something that ccp and most of the players dont want ah btwif you are caught in a level 3 or level 4 missions by even 1 pirate your chances of surviving are almost 0 as the npc will gladly help him
a voice we have been told will never be listened to by the csms own minutes in which ccp admits it is going to do nothing to address any of the issues with eve apart from module lag for at least 2 years probably never why bother having the csm is they accomplish nothing
lets be honest and transparent about this i dont think its plausible to assume that the csm will ever have a hand in the specific development of the game because there are too many behindthescenes necessities that go into the development of a specific feature of which the csm is not privy they could suggest a certain feature but due to development costs of time and other resources it wouldnt be possible in all seriousness the csm would clog the development queue so badly ccp would spend years sorting it outtherefore the only reason for the csms existence is to provide ccp with a sounding board for player issues however this is neither efficient nor expedient would it not make more sense to simply conduct polls to determine the most important player issues one could argue that few people would take the time to participate in these polls but few people vote in csm elections now as with most things the squeaky wheel gets the greasebut also ccp has development plans that are put in place months or even years before the csm or even the players ever see them with that said the csm trying to squeeze in their own issues is rather pointlessat the end of the day the csm does serve a function but its neither efficient nor expedient for its intended purpose there are far less time consuming and expensive avenues that could achieve the same effect
the most inneed of review is the info warfare line which will hopefully get addressed ifwhen they take a look at the long languishing gallente ewar line
show the wormholes some love 3 3 3 still love you ccp if you dont just not as much
this op is good
yes
amen can we please have as many dev blog detailing fixes to content as we have gotten about lagactually fewer dev blogs would be okay but more manpower and more fixeskthx
actually trebor daehdoowis finishing the csm meeting minutes
i have to agree whole heartedly with you even better for them is if a satisfied customer promotes eve its free advertising ccp win with new players who arent worried about shinny new stuff because all the stuff existing in eve is totally new to them anyway we win because instead of loads of shinny new stuff that partially works alongside older stuff which also partially works is all brought into line and is made to work better and if it works better everyone is happy quality improves ccp are then able to redirect resources to further development instead of hit and miss fixes and other pacifying ways of trying to keep folks happy stop being so reactive ccp and be more proactive one good quality expansion per year is enough the other release times should be devoted to ensuring existing features are improved and maintained and integrated more efficiently into the game environment so they work well not just average or ok we evers care about eve very much we continue to pay and play because of and despite its flaws but that does not imply that we are prepared to or have to accept less than excellence in the features that are currently in the game environment
absolutely supported  especially the filter via sec status option
so any new by ccp or the csm 
just for the fact that this is a stellar example of how to make a proposal you get a thumbs up
although i had a feeling that i shouldnt i still googled futanari only have one thing to sayman wtfright now im thinking to hire mercs to wardec op just for this thisbah what the hell now wheres that bandwagonedit if you dont know what futanari is for the love of god and sanity  dont google it
so i had to wikipedia thisand i have to say this is exactly the kind of stuff that people are going to want incarnasecondlife in space forif i have to spend the next 18 months wasting an entire day every time i want to put up a pos clicking myself to rsi with pi and dealing with a horrific industry interface that they promised to improve with quantum rise then i definitely want some chicks with big fat wangs to distract me from the drudgery

yesi see no real down side for old players and the boost would be a nice boost to the new players
but but but but but
i happen to agree with you the concept of forcing people into dangerous situations will never work low sec needs holistic changes that will provide compelling reasons for more people to go or better yet live and profit there i think some forms of risk mitigation are reasonable to consider for pveers and industrialists especially for certain deadspace activities however in the bigger picture what i hope for is content based on the outlaw nature of low sec that drives unique opportunities which dont exist elsewhere and which work in the context of outlawstyle conflictsor are even part and parcel of them those kinds of changes should reward the adventurous smart opportunistic carebear or industrialist who is willing to play the gameyou knowforging relationships making deals paying attentionall the things related to the people side of things i know quite a few who do this now actually and they do pretty well in low sec imho any low sec revitalization should never cater to players just looking for lazy isklet them afk their missions in high sec all these concepts represent a difficult game design challenge but if it was successfully done i bet wed end up with a truly dynamic and fascinating section of the sandbox to play in it would make low sec awesome
i too am dissapointed the csm has done pretty much nothing about lowsec for a very simple lowsec change i have this

no this is possibly the stupidist idea ive ever heard of why would we want something that allows remote stacking of items it like youre trying to say this game should be logical or somethingsarcasm
this will inevitably open a door to those schurkes armed with plenty of experience and knowledge in court at biting off chunks of meet from someones chest with a massive flood of blood ccp with that much of relatively tiny profit and annual sales will go down without even having a chance to scream for sureit wont happencuz gamerz r all boneheads hmmmlets say im a guy whos just lost 740 plexes in a kestal  jita 44 knowing plex can be cashed out like op suggested what are my chances to say nah to a lawyer persuading me to drag ccp into a courtprobably very slight and it will inevitably happen i strongly hope ccp is that naive so i can 
eon magazine sold for plex  your title implied to me that eon is already being distributed for plex when that isnt the case maybe you should emphasise in the title that this is an idea not an existing situation
definitely agree both for market browsing and hangar sorting
not blue thats officer maybe orange  yellowpurple should be deadspaceotherwise yes i agree fully i do how ever feel that this could cause some sort of imbalance if there all of a sudden wasnt any low meta stuff what would the newbs do this would remove the actually having to sort element and breed further lazyness and remove memorization of game info just my 02
tags are good
idk about the colors thats certainly open to debate and tuning there isnt any current tag on deadspace officer gear though ingame killboards dont count pwhy wouldnt there be any low meta stuff though this just simplifies sorting it doesnt affect gear drop rates or selling patterns at all that and sorting through loot boxes isnt terribly fun this is a game and imo has enough planningsorting in it already
yes to all
i would like to draft a proposal with the assistance  support of a representative of csm to submit a proposal regarding the matter of sovereignty in wormhole spacewormhole space is not unique in its technical design to that of any 00 space other than graphical interfaces its pretty much the same yet whole space is not afforded any of the benefits of 00 and in fact are very much excluded if players  alliances living in whole want to fully develop their poss  strongholds it would be beneficial to all that such alliances can achieve sovereignty like any other in 00 it seems that this would be a natural development of whole just like ccp did with 00 sovereignty it would be helpful to get in detail from ccp what if any objection there is to this as personaly i cannot see any benefit in denying sovereignty to an alliance dominant in in ths sector of evethankyou in advance for yoru consideration with respect to the abovedelta2003
you got lots of advantages compared to normal 00 eg no cap hotdrops the big 00 alliances cant just drop a cap fleet into your system to wipe your posses and then leave againnot supported one of the nice things about wh space is the lack of the sov warfare
have you not heard of mass restrictions at the hole you cannot just hotdrop a capfleet into a whole for various reasons mass restrictions being one of many sorry but please read up about whole space thankyou for your post anyway
you want to read it again i said one of your advantage in wormhole space is that you cant get many caps dropped onto you 
darius im trying to see your rationale and argument against as i should on a debate and respect such however how does a tcu change those components that exist already with the benefits you mentioned please explainno alliance  corp can hotdrop  cyno  in a fleet you know this already the only way for a small fleet with 1 or 2 carriers to get into your whome is through the hole my proposal is for sovereignty in a system this does not mean by default that there would be changes to access by means of hotdrop far from itim enjoying this debate please continuebest regardsdelta2003
the reason stated repeatedly by ccp is that wspace was not intended to be permanently inhabited sovereignty by definition involves the claiminghabitation of the space they want mining camps and exploration outposts not wh empires
no its way too much to have wh defensive advantage and profitability and 00 sovereignty benefits maybe you want agents in your wh too
so wait lemme make sure im getting thisfor a small maintenance fee i could have uncontested sovereignty over the system the only way to contest sov is by setting up sbu at the incoming gates which there are none for whs 25 less fuel consumption for pos the ability to setup an infrastructure hub the most useful benefits of which being supercaps not sure if anyone really needs these but whatever pirate detection this results in guaranteed anomaly spawns meaning an endless supply of sleeper tags and salvage ore prospecting this results in guaranteed belt spawns meaning an endless supply of ore while its the same ores available to regular sov holders its better protected by the remote nature of whs and the bored supercap pilots survey network this increases the chances of finding profession sites meaning an increase in t3 production materials along with sleeper loot since theyre heavily guarded every timeso in short claiming sov in a wh would guarantee endless profit for the alliance with no way of having that taken away from themdid i miss anything
support for the mere chance to build titans in wormholes
marcus said it well i do not support this wormholes are supposed to be dangerous not hellokittied into a brothel
wh space doesnt have gates it cannot be jumped to via cyno it does not have fixed routes to each system if i wanted to attack your space i would have to get lucky and find a route to your spacewhen was the last time your system was hit by a roaming gang if you cannot honestly say within the last 2 hours then your wh space has a huge benefit over 00 if you want sov you need fixed routes to balance the benefits gained if this rolls out with a module that makes those fancy sansha whs that get you to the system you want to go to then i will support this
no total waste and complete utter failyou obviously do not understand sov mechanics like you pretend to do sowhs is disjointed and doesnt connect to any other space aside from totally randomized wormholeswhat your asking for would do nothing in the end other than become an incredibly expensive venture an to top that off concord has no jurisdiction there or ded i should say because they are the ones who track sov pardon the role play bitits 00 because its totally new space new frontier not been explored etcccp made it clear it is not the kind of space they want people to live in permanently this keeps its fresh and challengingusing ihubs to upgrade said space is game breaking at that point as far as the original intent meantbut who am i kidding here your just wanting moar stuffso no stealth proposal for younot supporting
thankyou for all your respeones and lets keep it going i still have not seen what the disadvantages to sovereignty in whole alliance could be i believe ccp often operate on the premise that any discourse advantage one over the other is the right course to take as the shift of pwer promotes fair gamethe more disadvantages and objections exist to a proposal ie an adavantage by one group over another is a great way to ensure enhanced game activity and can only promote the agrieved parties to try and take over said advantaged partyliving in a c5  c6 is no gay party and is often subject to roaming gangs with caps especially when plexing the sites plexing is no party with dps exceeding 25000  point  neut then salvaging with roaming gangs thats the dangerous parti agree with kaisersoze434 so in other words we one of the largest whole plexing corps must remain super miners for eternity and keep supplying 00  empire with tech3 sooner or later we will want more than that we wish to evolve in this game as others have and not just be tagged  super miners  building and supplying tech3i appreciate all yoru commenst and please keep this goingbest regards
the disadvantage is that it allows wh residents to truly setup space in such a way that they will not be able to be dislodged there is supposed to be risk risk is decreased by having sov as i stated you need to add other things that increase risk if you are going to decrease riskif your proposal were to happen 00 alliances would immediately take wh space as they would be invincible there
nothe goal should be to make wspace as different from kspace as possiblemake it more hostile to permanent settlementsmake it bigger stranger and with tons of cool eastereggs hidden in its deep dark cornersnot supported
not supported for the sake of variety of options in this game
reference thread
while i see the points you are making and they are valid i would have to say that instead of changing the dreads i recommend to change the way scs work and in doing so make dreads relevant again
thx for the contributions very good ideas
please make it stop please
while i agree with most of the proposal this part is a bit misleading low sec has approximately 8 of the population in 625 of the systems not a bad percentage unless i am mistaken low sec is approximately 500 system of the 8k currently present in the eve cluster character density is already higher than 00 or wh space one of the problems is if you increase low sec population in a system generally the pirate population grow faster than the carebear population so you reach rapidly a point where nonpvp activities cant be done i have done low level missions in deep low sec with rd alts for months without problems but as the standing get higher and you start to use the best agents in the mission hubs system you start to get more and more hostiles in system to the point where going to high sec is better so this part of your proposal is very importantsadly it is against ccp original idea of how low sec should work the few and easy to find mission hubs were made on purpose with the idea that they would spark conflicts and attract people currently they seem to do the reverse
excellent idea will make simply blitzing lowsec and 00 missions less of the only viable option which benefits pirates as well while providing a risk vs reward choice venkul mul yes of course i meant 2nd lowest behind wormholes corrected that people are leaving lowsec however and most of them leaving the game if youre going to go by my adress book contacts population density is only really being kept up by systems like tama old man star and amamake etc which is a single system per region basis increasing the population in lowsec works just fine as long as you spread them out lowsec is like predominion 00 big blobs of people here and there and everything else empty empty because there is nothing at all there place good agents in every constallation and it most certainly will become used assuming proposal nr 1 is done as well the mission hubs themselves are fine the problem is you have to choose the hub or might as well stay in 05 by adding lots of new agents that gives the mission runner far more places to choose from and forces the pirates to go around looking for targets rather than wait 237 in the same systems for targets that also means there is a bigger chance they will stumble across someone interested in shooting them as well roaming around as an outlaw there is always people wanting to shoot me at least
noive started to think about how many levels your suggestion is wrong on but realized that it would take me too much time to properly post about it lets just save time and reject this
as title says pos warp disruption batteries and warp scrambling batteries should be able to prevent supercapitals from warping offjumping out there is already to much supercaps they need to start dying with increased rate and this proposal is making life of supercap pilot only a bit more harderps if this proposal goes through it will be hilarious when i lose titan or supercarrier cause pos scrambled me p
since when do you login supercaps  oo there is no proof of that
i need to change skill from time to time
good idea
supercaps need to die in a ball of fire also i will laugh when mm lose a supercap to there own pos
to many supercaps  more should die i will also laugh when imperian dies to his own pos
me supports this too 
interesting idea i like itanything that holds a sc long enough for me to get proded out of my ship spinning coma and get to the fight is good in my book
rather than allowing the normal pos warp scramblingwarp disrupting batteries to hold down supercaps add a new warp disruption battery with similar attributes as the warp disruption field generator when using the focused point script it should have higher fitting requirements than the normal warp scramdisruptor batteries
to complicated p
to the endorsementcenter
because you would need to refit your possesor because it would follow the general rp with the ewar and supercapsi am kinda sure it wouldnt be difficult for ccp to reuse the hull of the current warp scrambling batteries and make them into focused warp disruption batteriesif you want to tackle supercaps with a pos it shouldnt come as cheap as a simple warp scramblingwarp disruption battery
the simplest way to implement change is simply to change data already included in ship design in game is the concept of role bonus2 warp strength currently only used in deep space transports make two data edits and you can have the same effect give motherships role bonus16 warp strength and titans role bonus128 warp strength this also introduces the added excitment of groups of ships being able to swarm and hold a supercarrier or titan pos warp scramblers are currently 6 so three of them can hold a mothership this change is so simple in the game and its impact a coding level is so trivial that the entire change cycle covering it will take less time and manpower than the discussion in this forumlater when time permits and supercaps read hel are being tweaked and titans are getting new weapons a capital warp scrambler and captial warp disruptor and capital stasis webifyer can be introduced to the game only usable by dreads in siege or titans
i can get behind this although even solo supercaps wont be troubled by unmanned poses but it will make them think twice before bumming around on poses with active gunners
supportin vuk lau proposal is supportin
pos modules should function in the same capacity as hic focused points which they should logically be doing anyway i mean a pos module is the size of a hic
i want it simple there is no need to do a parallel between hics and pos batteries cause hic is a ship and pos battery is structurei dont see one reason to implement new kind of pos warp batteries instead of just giving current ones ability to tackle supersthanx for support
whats the point really if wanting a pos battery to tackle a supercarrier when the dps from said supercarriers will just incap the pos module in mere moments then just jump away long before any significant force can be gathered to keep it tackled the issue is not them being unable to be tackled by pos modules but rather their ability to burn through the 99 hull resists with impunity a few scs can utterly destroy not incapacitatedestroy multiple pos modules with incredible speed

coming from someone who blobs low sec and carebear alts in high secif anyones whining its u for wanting more easy ganks and more safety behind your alt but ty for linking it yet againwere u hoping someone else would refute the last post since u couldnt because last time i checked u stated that if u couldnt refute a socalled proper argument ud close your thread not only have u failed to close your thread but uve also refused to reply not much of a proposal especially worth linking if u affirm that your own broken idea doesnt work 1 since ure a 10 why would u make the similar proposal that galvative did oh thats right ure exactly like himu just want more safety behind your carebear alt when things arent going your way in low sec2 funny how u also believe that bounty hunting should not occur in low sec that was hilarious especially since u asked me to verify that ure 10 3 and what is a better solution or positive feedback to u agreement sry if u cant feel 100 safe in the forums either maybe if u rubbed more than two of your own brain cells together ud actually notice my argument of how to make it work in low sec that is unless u affirm that u just want more safety for yourself in high sec and low sec
here we go again change the record we all know you dont want it fixed cos it might impact your little suicide operationat some point it will get fixed with probably a combination of all the ideas postedas i said before even if the proposal was solid as a rock you would still object end of story your the only one complaining does that tell you something ofc not silly me the world revolves around you and your game  anyone else
right now its armor tank or gtfo it is an insanely unfair advantage armor tankers have already over shield tankers and they got this toonot to mention the fact that trimarks stack and you can slap these on for a ed amount of ehp remove these from the game or introduced something for shield tankers too that is like it also make trimarks have a stacking penalty

fighters have quite a bit of trouble even hitting battleships even a huge number of fighters wont break a decent lovechain of a dozen battleships and some logis they arent great at killing small ships nor should they be i also agree that 25 is a tad harsh ambivalence on the last issue
anything to get rid of them being an invincible i win button bull that they are
a fleet of scs dreads and titans wth do you think we did when we were invaded hmm countered with an equal size supercap fleet with our own super cap fleet supported with triage carriers and smaller its called eve  not lets make everything fair ms kittynote if you cant roll with the large alliances then move back to npc or lowsec
i was talking about in low sec liang
i am with the op to have a reasonable nerf of sc and with those the hopefully increasing number of willingness from alliances to commit to fights without having superior number of the same of bigger shipclass at handas for the pointi think the issue is rather the ballancing of force its best said on a thread on scraphead as for the if you cant roll yada yada the current number of super capitals makes it impossible for any new alliances to roll with the so called large ones this is the mainreason we only see reprocessed alliance x with left over super capitals threatening some sovereign here or there if they see a chanceto that comes the limit of super capital production being restricted to 00 in other words you buy from the big alliances funding them extra and stil expect to beat them after if you can hold through it hats of have we seen that in the past 2 years a single time but thats what made things like winning the isk war so hilarious phrasesas for your comment libracould you link me the dev blog or statement were ccp acctualy states that sc are ment to be a fleet on their owni mean i can see the point if i consider that you need a special skilled charackter  a big amount cynoalts p
zerosec space has and will always be ruled by large alliances it should not and never will be controlled by corporations unless youre the goons  even they were an alliance though super caps in lowsec for s is rare unless youre in a small alliance thats trying to chew more than it thought it could bite off titans cant dd in lowsec scs are just giant carriers and should be able to do everything that a carrier can keep in mind too that only the aeon has the potential to have a bigger tank that a titan and thats only with a titan pushing it bonuses otherwise they all have smaller tanksi still agree that super carriers should not have an rr bonus tbh id like to see that replaced with a drone mwd speed increase or something along those lines im still quite lost as to why you think theyre opd we use super caps quite effectively we dont  around with hotdrops into lowsec a its dangerious and b its boring we use them in fleet fights against titans and other scs if you plan to nerf the nyx its build requitements must also be nerfed as it stands theyre worth their weight in iskmineralsbuild cost of a nyx is about 126 bil if you drop the 18b for the hull current going prices in my area for a straight purchase youre paying for protection tower fuel etc while its in production as far as your statement for little rolling with the big  take a cynojammed system fill it with your little alliance members bs carriers dreads other scs and rest of fleet and  their  up when they jump in to you this is the same process for protecting baby scs in production as far as my comment goesnow look at the bonuses super carriers get there is no other role they can legitimately fill they were specifically designed to  pillage plunder and be their own fleet even back in the day when mr extreme was camping lowsec by him self sorry include his alt damnation in his nyx using his 20x bouncers and fighters it was abundantly clear that super carriers are designed for straight up damagenow i digress back to their price tag and i still agree that their tank is a bit large for their price they are exactly where they should be my exception is the aeon  however because it lacks any other bonus the extra resist bonus does make up for it bear in mind that to field an sc well youre talking months of training time 18b for the ship another 1015 for a fit mods implants rigs and then with a titan pushing you bonuses max you approach the titan sized tank so 31bil for a proper nyx one thats damn hard to kill is about right to me

i never said it should not be reigned by big alliances but the current trend with super capitals which more than hugely favor longtime spaceholder due to the ability of production and comming at the price of moongoo so without real effort from the individual player prevents any kind of mock up from an uprising alliance you are wrong super capitals are used on a regular basis even by small pirate corporations to simple hit lowsec reaction tower of smaller alliances the only reason you dont hear about that often is that those people only do riskfree pvp with not even loggig their supers in when some unscouted people are in systemalso how will you get a mass to rival spaceholding alliances if you constantly put your sc on the line seems a bit contradicting to me could you link me the 3 last battlereports of that could you link a single battlereport where you did not hotdrop a lone titan or mothership with a bunch of sc and titans  where you did not hotdrop a 510 sc with 18 you know this would not work the same way as i do know it there are even far bigger alliances with cap and super capfleets ready who cant even do that not only that it takes quiet some time until you can even cynojam a system but also expecting the attacking side to allready have enough sc to hold back the aggressor just shows the old alliance recycled mentality we have nowadays it just wont work otherwise if you dont rent and than most spaceholder even restrict super capital shipyard cause of funding the enemy chancerandom quotes as on any ship and as on most not even fitting what the player acctualy use them for give a clear statement from ccp as requested or dont suspect it to be intended like thatlet me try even back in the days when carriers were rare and ginger magician camped gates in his lone carrier it was obvious they were designed for  see were i get thats what introducing a bigger shipclass without any acctualy ballance leads tothe same as for a carrier minus the time needed to learn triageas for seeing the price argument i can see a ship being of that size and effectiveness being that expensive yes but its quiet argueable that a ship not even half the price of a titan should also be able to reach half or more of its tankto that comes the far higher diversity of motherships from a full row of utility highslots over a huge number of different drones including ewar the fighterbombers dealing massive damage to capital shipspos structures and a row of normal fighters than can also be asigned with both being able to also do good damage to subcapital ships
cool concept if you anchor them in kind of deadspaces so small scalers can build little bases in lowsec with limited ship access means frigate sized gates cruiser sized bc sized bs sized but of cause this will come in conflict with services that only a pos can provide or even an outpost but on the other hand this could fill in a gap for small scale players and really make lowsec more interesting the last lowsec boost most pirates might not have noticed was pi with planets in lowsec at around three times as profitable as hisec planets there is a lot of traffic into that okay lots of cheap traffic because the poor pi players usually fly that with cheaply fitted t1 haulers who do not carry anything worth mentioning with them but still  a target is a target and the profit is still tempting enough to draw people out there so what does people move into lowsec profit with wh space and rich arkonor deposits in those wormholes the miners get much better roids than they can expect from pirate infested lowsec systems they are moving less into lowsec were they only might find kernite which is not much more worth than omber for example  without the riscso why move into lowsec with a scattercity i think it might be a good way to add some style maybe find use for the last few npc goods that are still useless like prostitutes or exotic dancers or the pax amarrianits just about style its about roleplay its about pride our city in lowsec our base in lowsec something like this maybe some storage but no processing maybe some market funktions maybe games entertainment and with dust this might even have some functions for the gruntcapsuleer communicationi am no fan of giving it pos functions like refining arrays or even production because this is what poses are for and with the endless falling price of pos structures  how hard is that to setup a pos anywaybut poses are boring they have very few social life there is even no real possibility to allow guests to your structure in eve plexes you often see structures where those entertainment ships are docked with a pleasure hub inside or a casino i dont know how to actually make money with them but on the other hand its not more afk money than moon mining anyway if the profit downscales accordingly to the investment i see no real problem in that i dont see one in pi either or does anybodyi just think this could make those npc plexes go live and move away from just being npc available id like to see anything that is running over npc playable over the player base in eve this also could be a drain for the lowtech drugs that drop from missions in hisec there are damn many lose ends in the eve industry that should be covered like pi did cover a lot of them  which i find a great step

edit nvm
im prety sure i read a thread similar to this a while back where someone from ccp stated that they tried to impliment something like this once and the code base told them to  off cant remember the exact details and dont have time to look for it now my lunch break is just coming to an endnot supported if this were to come into being then it would eventualy end up that all pvp would happen there just due to human nature ie i cant be arsed hunting for that idiot ill just go to the arena and eventualy theres no one to hunt they are all at the arena
im not saying having ccp create an arena is a good idea i think it would be better if players did that and the fights would be protected by gate guns or what not that the players who build the arena would have to buy the arena could of course be destroyed but i do think eve definitely needs some way to bring decent pvp to players who want it quicker there are numerous ways to do this ccp just needs to acknowledge that warping and jumping and scanning and warping and jumping for hours in order to get blobbed in the end is not helping the game they can then forcus on how to make certain mechanics so people who want decent pvp action can get it more quickly
as long as i can scan down your arena and drop a discopoc into the middle and blow everything up okay
1 not all fleets are advertised2 i was thinking about the ability to change it on the fly fleet compositions change fleet locations change for example and an fc or boss can more quickly change the chat channel message than going back and changing the fleet adverto3 also will help when combining fleets a message can be put in so the new members join the proper wing or squadagain just looking for quick easy ways to make the whole eve experience flowrothgr bronnroyal order of security specialists
then advertise it its literally one extra clickone extra clickand it would take you probably less time to change a fleet advert plus the fleet advert change is on the history tabif youre not already in communication with the fleet youre joining with or be joined by to get correct shiptypeswingssquadsyoure just doing it wrong and no change to chat channels will change thatadding new features that are already handled easily quickly and imho a much better format only makes it redundant and a waste of time not a major time saver
or you could have the fleet description on the top of the fleet chat channel

be careful with boosting missilesrockets guns are affected by transversal and this in a way that is weighting much more than you can destroy missilerocket damage by speed a rifter can speedtank a dual laser fitted punisher for example down to 10 their theoretically dps and this is true for all gun related weapons missiles are uneffected by one of the second most common ewar used so far  the tracking disruptor you cant td a drake there is nothing you can do to reduce a drake and in my humble opinion a boost of the drake is something nobody really needs it might be that the rockets are a bit underpowered for the standard missile but i would strongly oppose a general missile boost missiles have already so many advantages that make it superior in many fights like not stoppable by td fireable even unter jammingsensor dampen by fof full damage on maximum range as well as on zero range try that with an artillery on a moving target switch damagetype with full damage on the perfect hole of a tank dpsand many more so just be careful heavy missiles heavy assault missiles torpedos and i think even standard missiles are okayish rockets might be a bit low but not so much as people want you believe do not compare eft values of dps but instead effective dps in fights and if the dps is so gimp why is the drake and the ravennavy raven the most prefered missionrunner everthere is something wrong i strongly reject a general missileboost but i support that the rockets alone should have a lookover if this lookover comes to the result its okay id be a bit surprised by that but acceptable it is a quite small adjustment but not a big hammer i think
aye got my vote 
whats this for a kind of wierd comparison nobody uses hail for autocannons because the tracking is that UFFFD up that it is rendered completely useless so the dps from this setup is nothing but a paper tiger its void you do not have such a dps with the jag and this supports what ive said earlier that you should not compare crappy eft warrior numbers but effective dps in combat situations the dps from turret guns go down by speedtanktracking issues to lower than 50 than their original value if you compare those two boats then compare it under a normal setupcirumstances for a infighting gunboat you will have normally a distance of about 1400 meters more or less and a transversal speed of about 70 to 80 of their theoretical speed with afterburner even less if its armored if nobody is calculating the true damage of both boats i will do it in a few days myself ive done that before but have today sadly no time and im sure the rockets will not be that bad concidered their range their perfect match of damage type their invulnerability to tracking disruption jamming and sensor dampen by fofif you give numbers please give sane comparisons so that one can work with that
he damn right sucks not even fun trolling 
supported for silencing stupidityseriously if you dont understand how the game works then dont comment on what you think is wrong with it
let us divide stacks into smaller equal stacks with one click not 25 and a pocket calculatorand dont limit this to stations like the current split stack optionand a pony

moved on request of op from market discussions to assembly hall
adding in to my response since the post moved mainly just to sign it pi think this would increase the readership of the magazine and the money as far as i can tell goes to ccp either way

worm holes should be more customizable this will get them more in line with 00
you know if cromo thinks its a good idea its really notthread
nulli personally have no problem with bringing wormholes in line with null sec in addition to sov they should have permanent gates linking them to other wormnull systems sleeper spawns should also be available throughout the eve universe  only baby sleepers in hisec and gas clouds should be as common as veldspar when ccp commits to this then i will fully support this motion nulluntil then not supported
no reasons already listed by other players space that is always having the way inout changing means no one can cohesively threaten you thus you are near permanent residents and under little if any real threatif you want to be more than advanced miners i suggest you petition for more 00 better changes to 00 a 3rd type of space you could conquer but that doesnt give you the safety of wh from other player power blockgroups or save your money and look to rent some 00 space
not supportedif you had sov you could build an outpost you then would have an indestructible haven with no fuel requirements it would be almost impossible to remove you from the wh because noone would be able to bring the firepower to do it

it bothers me to see my machariel bigger than a thanatos and still fit inside it make carriers 12kms larger moms too
sure why not
this is an amazing idea right now super carriers are hot dropping lone capitals left and right all they ing do is try and look for easy ganks with total immunitythey are too  to do a real attack so they resort to this fail cowardly attacks a pos should be a safe place not an infestation of cloaked up cyno frigates lurking near bridges and cyno gens only revealing themselves to cyno in a super carrier to gank a capital
yes supercaps need to start dying a little more often as every rich  seems to have them nowno just because the nc is getting butt hurt because of their pilots not checking systems for cyno alts before moving around doesnt mean something like allowing supercaps to be warp scrammed by poses should be added
what kind of ed up idea is thisjust because your too lazy to check systems for cyno alts and your getting hot dropped by super capitals you want 100 safetysorry vuk but this idea will not make up for your pilots stupidity we all know you want the whole nc space to have every system to be cyno jammed and have jump bridges everywhere so you pilots can move in total safetywhat next covert cyno jammers too oh wai
euhm this proposal would not result in 100 safety if anything it will decrease the 100 safety of the attacking side by giving defenders at least a little bit extra time to rallyright now only chance you kill hotdropping super caps on a pos is when you were baiting them allow pos warp scrambling batteries to actually scramble them and you might just get there in time before they incapped every pos modmore risk for supercaps  good
lykouleon and trygonusi dont recall when was the last time someone i care for got ganked by supers tbh everyone who jumps anything semivaluable blindly and get ganked fully deserve to die so no this was not at all reason for me to bring this up not to
so you have been losing caps at some pos recently because they decide to jump before scouting the system they got what they deserved now you want to have a change to discourage the hot dropsnothere is many ways to avoid getting hot dropped like using a scout having a dictorinterdictor there to make the super cap think twice or hell maybe a sensor boosted zealot there to insta pop the cyno frig so by the time the super cap loads he is in the middle of no whereor you could just cyno jam every system and have a jump bridge in every system so you guys never have to worry about being hot dropped and never have to take another gate again again in case i didnt make myself clearplayers should be the scout and the deterrent not a pos module because you want to be lazy or impatientnot supported
did you actually read what i wrote or you are just continuing plaguing this forums like you are plaguing caod with your bitter posts
awesome idea 1
typically when i check evekill before going to bed cuz capital losses make me sleep better i usually chuckle maddly when i see doom killing nc caps left and right with hotdropsuntil the nc does similar all this purposal looks like to me is a whiney post that marlona and the badboys of ncdot are hurting us waaah waaah waaahnot trying to troll but thats what it looks like to me and considering the list of current supporters as well
yes i read what you wrote it is a bad ideajust send out a 87 alliance wide blue list mail stating for people to start scouting the pos they are about to jump their capital tochanging a game mechanic should not happen because people want to be lazy
i dont need more safety i live in lowsec and anyone can shoot memy idea is not there for my own good its to fix a game mechanic that in its current state is flawedi said bounty hunting should occur in low sec just not 00 as 00 is lawless space it would just be harder to find a person who is based there if you were on a bounty mission and chased a guy into 00 you would no longer get help of npc bounty office to track the target it would be up to your own innitiative in high sec 0110 the bounty ofice would tell you where the target is currently located so you can track them a bit easierby positive feedback i am suggeting you read the post analyse whats good and bad and then produce what i call the sht sandwichmake a good point then tell them whats wrong then finish with something positive that kind of critisicm gets results your kind of critisism just makes you look like a 
heres the thing and try to keep up your proposal is far from rock solid to say the least thats why ppl objected to it and thats why u didnt reply to itbecause u couldnt do u get it or r u gonna continue your usual routine of ignoring anything u want and repeating the same exact things over and over again of course we all know the answer to that but oh wait thats rightcause ccp should be catering to only u by making high sec 100 safe so your alt can hide in it when not even your low sec blobs can cut it huh whether its ingame or in forums its u who doesnt wanna get ed with 1 sure they can shoot u they just have to choose to primary u since u also have 5 others with u at all times2 low sec is hardly policed space because theres no concord there just sentry guns and sec status penalties which does nothing to 10s as u already know which leads to3 fyi 0104 is not high sec 4 so ure proposing to fix this mechanic by replacing it with another broken one that gives bounty heads especially the ones alliedalted with a 00 alliance the ability to escape this mechanic bounty head pops into the 00 hes blue to and what happens the bounty hunters time and effort was for nothing since hell never know where his target is now or when hes coming out of 00wormholes but obviously thats what ure going for isnt it 5 oh im sry cause last time i checked the list of good points is up to the original poster since umthose r the reasons why he created the proposal in the first place6 is pointing out the flaws in your proposal too much for u too handle cause this is a forum after all if u want moral support to get u through this stressing ordeal make the proposal work to the point where its not broken by playing favorites or not being practical to utilize outside of high sec maybe then ull be taken more seriously as someone who truly wants to fix the bounty system rather than just another carebear pirate who only wants to avoid risk behind a high sec alt
i have a problem with the extractor setup in planetary interaction i think the best idea would be to have a right click menu on the command center of your planet that gives you the option to start all your extractors on a 30 min 5 hour 23 hour  or 4day cycle i see no benefit to game play or ui by having to click through every single instalation on your planetary base infact i find it very annoying surely that is what a command center is for centralising facility managementsuch a simple detail but i got 6 elite bases and not much time to play eve each day rl is just not that generous to me anymore allthough id love to do pi i have now stopped almost completely due to the time it takes to reset extractors not to mention the imminent rsi my index finger is gonna get lolme pokes ccp with a big stick 
sweet zombie jesus yeswe need extractor grouping im currently running two accounts with all six character slots full four are actively producing pi goods while two more are still in training all necessary pi skills to level 4 and none at level 5 i have in total runningeditanother character just finished and dropped a few ccs23 command centers23 space ports25 storage facilities185 extractors219 refineriesccp youre more than welcome to verify these numbersand the pi structure count keeps on increasing adding to the fact that i have to mess with it about every five or six hours that translates into 740 times per day that i have to click my extractors and ive still got two more characters that have yet to lay down any ccs yet some of us really really need extractor grouping
lemme check the shield modules ooh maybe something like an invulnerability field ii 30 resists all across the board as it stands shield and armor tanks are nicely balanced with shield tanks having more resists but less actual hp and armor tanks having less resists but more actual hp
energized regenerative membranesyou are lucky kid lets better stop and nerf that damn velator and not to mention those uber civilian modules that clearly wreck all balance of power ya can fit eight civilian autocannons on a battleship and in fact fire forever no need of ammo or crystals or energy a fleet of say 2000 of that ships would nearly be invinciblethats a serious problem i can see gankfleets of 2000 in maelstrom battleships that come and suicide gank freighters at uedama with those and those guns are for free madness
i support banning cromo from ever speaking again he obviously has zero understanding of the game and is talking from his rear end
i think it would be much more logical to simply limit the number of ships capable of neutrally remote repping in high sec to 1 ship at a time i know its useful if youre testing a ship out with a friend or something like that however the fact that a single ship can be made practically invulnerable to all dmg by just having 6 neutral remote reppers seems like an exploitative avoidance of a high sec war dechigh sec wars should be fought between the declaring corpalliance and the receiving corpalliance all neutrals should be forced to stay out of it or either join or place another wardec if they wish to participateexample scenario corp to corp wardec very inexpensive yet the corporation declaring war could have a very large informal alliance of 1015 logistics ships show up this to me looks like a way to exploit the cost of declaring war by utilizing forces not taken into consideration when the price of the wardec was established
i like how a bunch of alts and no names are refuting this idea here but on shc all the big names of eve are coming out saying yep there needs to be a change lets exploit it so bad that ccp will have no choice once again it shows the obvious disconnect this forum has for any legitimate arguments sake even seleene is posting that theyre out of balance and hes the one who implemented the idea
i think the pirate aspect of the game could stand to be enriched
i know a revamp of the ui is being worked on but could we get the current right click customizable for instancevia the escape menu i should be allowed to remove add and change the position of the options of what shows up i dont want self destruct or say rename ship i should be allowed to move the jump to and bridge to apartmaybe some background color too but you get the idea i hope it is not a total revamp of the ui but would allow us to make it better what do you guys think

may i have a link to the statement pleasenot supported for the reasons the above posters stated alreadynewbies already have a boost as well so it servers no purpose at all
overall eve has quite a customizable interface and ui you can pretty much skew everything to your own standards and place things the way you want colors can be edited transparency as well even those nasty reds can be made greens or purples if you want on your overviewwhat i am proposing here is a broadening of the existing customizable uireplace the existing static colors assigned to standings with a rgb color slider this is to allow players greater control over their displayallow colors to be assigned to ewar states currently if you go into overview settingsappearanceewar and right click on a type of ewar you have the option to assign a color to it but it does nothingallow color states to have a clearly assigned number priority in overview settings example pilot has terrible standing priority 2  red color pilot is warp scrambling me priority 1  turquoise color note i believe this is already functional by moving things up or down on the listwhen blink is assigned to an entity the next lowest nonblinking color is shown when the blink fades example player is warp scrambling me priority 1  turquoise color  blink on player has terrible standing priority 2  red color  blink off a player with terrible standing who is warp disrupting me well show red and blink turquoise only the highest priority blink and non blink will show others will be negatedsimple idea already existing ingame almost big implications in regards to users identifying events ingame

thats why we have regular skills theyre a clear demonstration of time spent vs reward the reward being whatever the skills allow you to do except learning skills whicha only widen the alreadymassive gap between new and old players and frankly the playing field could use a little levelingb have no affect on gameplay whatsoever its a needless sink of 1 month of training that slows down the alreadyglacial pace of the game for newbiesc only serve to lock characters into career paths ccp has demonstrated with the removal of racial skill bonuses that they want characters to have the option to go into different career paths whenever they choose having training skills heavily invested into one area discourages players from expanding to different areashonestly i dont see why they exist at all other than for the sake of roleplayers im no longer a newbie but i could see why new players would be turned off the game because they have even more catching up to do

agreed good idea see if you can rally more support for this proposal and ill revisit it again before the first csm meeting in september the earliest it can qualify to be raised anyway i suspect well be putting together yet another collection ui stuff like the low hanging fruit one or possibly amending that one depending on how csms feel about it this would be a good candidate for that
of course
just fyi doubt this could work unless ccp implemented a way to offer all store merchandise for plex in lieu of cash because ccp does not publish eon mmm publishing does although ccp might underwrite the costs of publication i have no ideawould be kinda cool to pay for stuff from the eve store with plex thoughsince plex  income for ccp so they dont lose out cuz someone somewhere had to purchase the plex in the first place for rl cash
edit without the currency i support this but id really love to hear any links to dev discussion about this if anyone has anything searching through this thread now id suggest contacting the people that didnt support due to currency ingame and rounding up support
removed the portion of the op that related to currency proposal due to lack of support please consider this only related to the removal of highsec highways between empiresaubps need to disclose a bias built into varo jans position throughout this thread after the main discussion took place it was later discovered that varo is setting up a franchise business across all empires a pos  research franchise removal of the highsec highways would severely limit his ability to accomplish this thus consider his arguments on that basis

i support this message however i fear it will not be done for hardware reasons on client side where they lag down a players machinethen again they could do a small increase to caps but decrese the size down the chain
i dont think this is necessary supercaps are dieing quite often if theres a problem with supercap numbers try pushing something that makes them harder to build like requiring an upgrade to produce a supercap that is both expensive and requires the alliance to hold x number of systems

remove unprobable t3 crusiers with implats and 100 skills they are still not probable this is unrealisting considering the best of the best cannot track them yet a directional will even if it takes a higher set of skills to do so they should have some risk of being probed in low and null space no risk no reward i always thought
before you started your little emorant did you bother to even take into account what is necessary to make one of those ships unprobableyeah you cant find itbut it sure as hell aint gonna amount to much in a fightno risk no rewards come a price but your too busy throwing a fit over not getting your gank you forgot that
ironically it would be easier just to fit a cloak instead of going through all that trouble to become unprobable if it is an exploit its not a very good one
why is ccp not giving me free killmails this is an outrage
rabble rabble rabble i demand plexes for posting here this is an outrage ccp needs to make this happen
while i dont like the fact that someone can be impossible to probe out i understand that their ships become next to useless due to the modules needed to reach that 108 ratio the real problem is that people can still mission in unprobable tengus and thats just wrong
why is it wrong
because he cant probe them out to kill them how dare you think that eve can be played in a different way
not a fan of cloaks heypvp is haaaaaarrrdd i want delayed local and no unprobable ships and i should get a warpin on every ratter as soon as i enter the system rabble rabble rabble
ah yes still not supporting
let me start of by saying i miss the old eve red moon rising is when i got in game i know there have been patches and things added to make our eve life better but we have way to many things wrongim not going to go through list but im going restate my case on a fewhigh sec is full of griefing corps ie corps that wardec everyone we want our pilots to get into corps more and out of npc corps but when they do the corp gets war deced and they cant function and they quit or go right back to npc corps stop the war decs in high sec 06 and uplow sec gate guns are too weak i can tank them  but if you like the idea of pirates then take the security hits out of low sec leave the guns or no sec hit and put one or two concords and let us duke it out or be able to run  or amp the gunsthis is it for now let the flaming commence
conversely i propose that all npc corps are drafted into the faction war and are war decable also war decs are invalidated in starter systems against npc corpsi support keeping that part of low sec mostly as is though i admit id be 1 to the removal of the sec status system since it punishes pvp and rewards pve even when carebearing in low sec i in myself frustrated by the sec status system if someone comes into my mission theres very little doubt what hes there for and i have no intention of just letting him gank menot that im a carebear liang
i can agree with this however let me address the issues one at a time1 the wardec system is horribly broken but how do you fix it this is not a forum to gripe and complain but to offer suggestions on how to fix what is broken lets figure out a way to fix the wardec situation as even ccp knows its broken2 gate guns are pretty weak as the ships have been improved but the gate guns have been left alone to the point that most larger ships can tank them again what do you propose to fix itthat said ive seen lots of threads on both issues but the solution is elusive lets work together to fix the problems until i see this i cannot support a whine thread
next time you are trying to troll please leave this sentence out the subject itself is obvious but with this sentence in your original post it makes it even more obvious
i propose that wardecs only be permissible between corporations that consent to entering the wardec pool any corp that doesnt pays a fee to keep out of that pool the fee not to exceed what a wardec on that corp would cost same for alliances
yea no i agree it needs fixing but this definitely isnt it
i like this idea a lot but i feel it needs modified slightly npc corps naturally cannot pay the fee since they have no player ceo and thus are war decable the fee should be 50 mil  maxnum members in corp during week payable on sundays in an effort to prevent abuse of the system the fee multiplies by 20 if you are currently war deced and maxmembers becomes maxmembers in last 6 monthsi believe this would help eves economy by encouraging more carebearing and provide a massive isk sink as risk averse people flock to war dec immune corps liang
id liek to propose that either ccp implament a choice to players to be able to use the old eve graphics or the neworgive some new graphics option that are more old computer friendly perhapse making the graphics able to be dumbed dow to old graphics equiv or possably even lowerthis would help 3 groups of ppl those that dont have highend machines those that multibox and it would also help in large fleet battles
yep i can support this idea
yeah this would really help my system perform better
a really good idea ccp should look into this
yeah i vote in fav of this idea
this could open eve up to people with lesser computers i see the point made
a fine idea every now n then i come across an area that even with the graphics down theres still something left to be desired in reguards to performance
hey i mostly dont care 1 way or the other but the thread creator is a friend and i know it would help them
yeah additional graphics options would have limited uses in my game but im sure theres people out there that could benefit from being able to lower graphix even farther so i see that this could benefit ppl so im onboard with the idea
yes
what a waste of programming time it has a drop down so you can see the implants that are on the clone if you actually played the game instead of forum whoring you would know thiseven still i would rather them fix lag than waste time with such a minuscule issue
excellent idea
yes naming them would help easily identify them possibly their purpose in that system and so on

cromo  says the one who has effectively gotten the assembly hall laughing and screaming all at once  ban cromo threadsupportedit be nice to specifically name clones without having to read the fine print of implants also should include remote self destruct command
sigh im pretty sure they were trying to prevent people from wanting to do thisso lets say we add extractor grouping then people will be doing it in 60 planets at a time and the stuff will be worthless and people will still complain that they have to click so much the whole pi system needs to be adjusted but just making it easier is not the solution
if the extractors are grouped like modules can be on your ship ui or if they are grouped by planet as another option i dont mind a global extractor button would make it too easy i agree my point is it feels like work to me as opposed to play and that defeats the object of spending time in a game for me at leastthank you very much for the feedback tho o7
even if they made it a skill you have to train i dont carechanges must happen
well consider this ccp wants these goods to be 100 produced by other players however the demand for such goods would require most everyone running their own pi setup most players dont want to bother with pi which means those of us who do must do so on a large scale we keep the prices down by keeping supply uptheres big profit to be had and where theres profit there will always be players looking to go to the distance to capitalize on it and by profit i mean enough to compete against mid size moon mining operations it was only natural that players took pi to large scale operations were filling a market hole that other players are not interested andor too annoyed to put forth the effort to fillright now the biggest problem with pi on a large scale like this is time constraints and a poorly designed extraction process it takes me around 45 minutes to log into each character and set all the extractors for a 5 hour cycle doing this four times a day may not seem like much but three hours of nothing but pi in eve each day gets tiresomeyou say that youre pretty sure ccp was trying to prevent people from wanting to do something like this that may or may not be true but the high demand for pi goods and apparent lack of players filling that need evolved into the situation that i and others are in it has become a monster that ccp has created and now it falls on them to take responsibility for itbtw i am considering opening a third account for this purpose the profit im pulling in from my current operation more than pays for plex cards to keep them running
i agree with the captain demand is epic everything i have sold on the open markets has gone in the first 24 hours  never seen anything like it i am out in the sticks so to speak too i guess it must be equally busy in the hubs i would say this is beyond demand and more a vacumea lot more material can be dropped into the market before prices take a hit in my opinionalso this is a new feature still and change is inevitable i am just trying to field some options for consideration and im sure the devs will balance and tweak things in stagesim also skilling my third account to persue pi with various alts following soon definatly something im commited to doing in the long run
i have seen countless ideas on how to fix blisters all have been over the top or overly complicated the solution is very simplei was watching spiderman 3 best one btw when it hit me make blasters have a web effect on the target just like spiderman does so as you shoot them depending on ammo type and range it will slow them down like a web now you will be able to get in optimal range to use the damage and tracking wont be an issue either
err isnt that what a web is fornot supportededit first in a cromo effect thread hunting his comments evesearch is cheatinghas become a minigame of mine its fun
blasters need a fix but since this is a lolcromo thread i will only say this one wordadoigurisoapsoaiateruieoapathank you for your comprehension
spiderman 3 gave me chronic diarrhea though the idea is interesting but blasters realy need alot more tracking and dps i mea the mega only out dps the geddon by 9 under 8km range and both can use a full flight of unbonused heavies though blasters could be given more range so they can get 30km effective range so they can be used in 00 cr bs blobs which is dominated by geddonsamarr bs line up wih pulsescorch that would also require a large auto range buff though and be not a very popular buff overall and lead to alot of rage i personaly favor increase hybrid damagetracking but i cant support anything that came from spiderman 3 till my chronic diarrhea that i got from it goes away
been waiting for one of these anyone who posts below this remember this is a troll and does not deserve your support or otherwisealso i dont recall spidermans blasters having a web effect

nobody asked you either yet you decided to give your opinion anyway weird that your allowed he isnt an no i am sorry but he is just another person who is playing a game like the rest of us grow up and stop hero worshiping its sad and a little embarrasingps  nothing against you chribba you seem a nice enought chap just a wee bit tired now it reminds me of chuck norris jokes where everything thinks they look cool by definition of joining in
chribba has won eve monetary might military might and he even took some sov for a few days somebody doesnt know about chromo effect 
chribba is not just some guy without him eve would not be what it is todayimagine an eve without eve files eve search eve agents and no way to safely get titans or motherships without either building them yourself or scamming someonehe has deserved a yellow veldspar band for a long time now and it is shameful ccp have not done so
what color does veldspar have
brown
yes signed
supporting because cromo doesnt like it and because chribba is awesome
supported because chribba once gave me free stuff those veldspar mining crystal ii bpcs made me richer than anyone can imagewell not really

mom trades with chribba  i dont trust people i know personally this well loleditsupport tick
imho chribba wins eve
what a stupid idea chribba may provide eve related services to the players of eve and be viewed as trustworthy by some but at the end of the day he is just another player no more no lessnot supported and gtfo brownnoser
the veldspar must flow
yes
cromo obviously doesnt know who chribba is well he doesnt know anything ban cromo effect threadthat said chribba is evesupported 
even though chribbas awesome i cant support this i hope he wouldnt eitherfwiw i consider this a pretty lame troll thread
hello i wonder if it would be possible for players to be able change the background of the login screen to eves older login screens if they choose so i know that ccp have put alot of work into their recent expansion but it would be cool for players to go back to old login screens like apocrypha or the empyrean age just for the epic music and backgroundsplease could this be talked about in the csm because i think that it is not just me who would like this to become a feature
yop would be a cool feature
not bad ideathere are some better things to improve for sure but i think this could be added to the list
pretty cool idea
yes
supportin disnot a huge issue hell not even an issue but it would be sweet
this guy is hilarious i think he should still be allowed on this forum i get a good laugh out of him and his stupid poasts
lol
like remote ecm bursts
youre so very wrong supercarriers are so dirt cheap that most anyone in my corp can go buy one personally with the tiniest bit of grinding furthermore its not at all uncommon for a supercarrier drop or a titan bridge even when youre 2 jdc5 cyno jumps from any 00 system for instance im fairly sure theres at least 4 titans and 20 supercarriers that live within bridge range of amamake weve seen 20 supercaps dropped on us in the middle of aus tz ffsyou want your 00 alliance tools to be overpowered thats great man  knock yourselves out just get them the  out of low secliang
i shall call you on your bs 15 billion plus 4 billion in fittings plus fightersetc is not dirt cheap  nor require the tiniest bit of grinding but hey feel free to go out and create the universes biggest supercapital blob since hey you can all afford them and kill the ones that are annoying youthey are not overpowered and a stupid pilot will lose his expensive ship very quicklyas i stated in the other supcarrier thread the resolution to this problem is finding a way to limit their production not nerf a balanced ship to bits
lets put that 20 billion in perspective a bit 100 hours of grinding at 200m iskhr 3 weeks at 200m iskhr and 5 hoursday 20 pithum atype msbs chump change for someone playing the market 29 gtcsseeing as how 200m iskhr just isnt that much im just not seeing how its that expensiveexactly the only answer to a supercap blob is a bigger supercap blob this argument has caused more nerfs than any other argument in historyand a smart pilot traveling in a smallish gang of them will almost never lose his certainly not in low sec where the counters are even more limited and much much more rare than in 00agreed id love to see the means of production nerfed 500 billion for a supercarrier and 1020 trillion for a titan should be good for now but only a fool would say theyre not overpoweredyou want to make the argument that theyre 00 alliance tools then make them 00 alliance tools  get them the  out of low secliang
people love to whine theres nothing wrong with supercarriersmoms the only things that need changing are1hel needs more ehp2hel needs a better bonus as 75 to rep amount perlvl is useless seeing as it cant triage3there models need to be like 50 bigger thats itfor the rest of the whiners in here go back to farming missions or lol warfare that the rest of eve doesnt give 2 s about and shut upoh and what ever your smoking is some bad s a nyx wont take 15 dds try 89
fully bonused erebusdamnation properly fit 28 eans and xtype hardererns and t2 rigs and properly implanted a nyx gets upwards of 52 mil ehp wo erebus but with damnation its about 45 mil are there plenty of people out there who do not meet those criteria absolutely but in situations of organized fleet warfare its far less likely an aeon can get upwards of 7580 mil depending on fit a wyvern can get anywhere from 5075 mil depending on just how rich and wasteful a player wants to be a hel can typically get somewhere from 3545 unless youre a  like viper shiz and think its better to armor tank it than shield tank itno good fc goes into a fight with that much riding on the line assuming his side or the other side are that moronic that they will not fit properly or bonus properly if they do the fight is almost always decided before they ever jumped ie gank
yeah there is something wrong with supercarriers theyre in low sec take them back to lolsovwarfare that the rest of eve doesnt give 2 s about and shut upliang
bang on got my vote
thanks i think it would be a huge boon to the game to see item x have stat x buffed a bit as it stands item y utterly outclasses it by stat x and stat y i hope to see a fix to it some time in the next 18 months
remove the gate guns the way i see it they only restrict what types of ships you can use in losec to bcUFFFDs and up ive never seen gate guns help or protect a wandering newbie or carebear pirates allways know they are there and tank for it we should still keep all the losec rules off no bombs bubbles and so on this would distinguish losec even more as a space between hisec and null if gate guns where to be removed we could use frigs destroyers cruisers interceptors stealth bombers and so on in losec too this serves two purposes first it would make losec more fun and diverse you could go on a roam in smaller ships have some fun fights and you wouldnt see a battlecruiser everywhere you fly second newer players and those with thinner wallets could finally come into losec and try to get a fight without risking all their savings flying a bc ofc you can fly frigs in losec now too but most fights occur at gatesstations where the guns are at id stay in losec forever if the guns were removed when i started eve i had a dream to fly a small fast and somewhat cheap ships that i could replace while learning pvp i skilled up interceptors stealthbombers electronic attack frigs recon ships and the likes and i cant use them as most fights are taking place at gatesstations yes i could move to 00 or join fw but i dont want to i like losec
noall you would get is remote sensor boosted insta locking interceptors in every gate camplowsec pvp is more than gate camping just saying
yes because pvp is all about gate campingno piracy doesnt need any more of a boost if you want to use a frigate in lowsec fine just dont break the law in sight of the police the sentry guns shoot outlaws wartargets or be a pirate somewhere away from gates and stations
you really should stop seeing things its producing awful ideas
completely agree
btw sokratesz i no longer hate your frog anyhow back on topicok i have to admit that i was curious to find out more details about her real world political career what i read was somewhat of a surprise if you go to the pirate partys wikipedia entry it lists that of the ten thousand votes cast for pirate party candidates she came in secondand this brings up another curiosity doesnt the pirate parties purpose and ideals stand in direct contrast with the very nature of an nda now the question would be if she was already part of it when she became a csm and if that in itself was a partial reason behind her dismissalparty party wikipedia entry
i dont know i think you might be mistaking them for wikileaks 
you are misinterpreting the results a little while the pirate party won 10471 votes nationwide holland runs its elections on a partylist propotional representation system and eva was second on the list submitted by the pirate party that means if the party had gained enough votes for one seat the first on the list would have won a seat and if enough for two seats then eva would have won a seat needless to say they were very far from attaining those resultsim also digging around a bit as it seems that the the memebers council of the pirate party has just forced the resignation of its board so eva may be out on her arse againah it appears that eva was not on the board but is a member of the members council as far as i can see she was one of three charged with preparing the party for the elections
hello fin look im sorry you didnt do well in your sophomore english class youve referred to it often in other posts and it obviously left quite an impression on you as for myself i cant help but agree with you that the postmodern turn can be full of rubbish but then what other intellectual movement doesnt have its share of garbage a still these repetitive insults are of no consequence to me and do even less to improve your credibility and yet there appears to be an agile mind behind these aspersions so how about a truceim more than happy as i have been in the past to listen sympathetically to your arguments indeed if youve been noticing my acceptance of pvp as an indispensable element of eve then perhaps youll see im not entirely opposed to your viewpoint in return please drop the insults deploy the principle of charitable interpretation to the posts i write and look for the winwin possibilities in our mutual points of view in this way we are much more likely to reach common understandings for the common good delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
being relatively new to eve and to these forums time and time again i read proposals on improvements to lowsec generally the suggestions involve gameplay mechanics and the solutions have just about nothing in common bar one thing incentivei think the best way to solve this problem is to ask the right people to approach the task eve has in the past gained the attention of certain academics  economists i believe ccp might consider asking theorists how to provide enough incentive for people to venture into lowsec its a sandbox world so the cause effect relationship would be interesting to documentthis might sound silly but there are philosophers and mathematicians who do nothing but think about these sorts of problems there might even be one or two amongst the playerbase probably not i knowthis post will be flamed to death but the problems of lowsec need to be seriously addressed a gameplay mechanic will only go so far unless its devised by someone familiar with the kind of thought it takes to create predictable social resultsor just fix the ing bounty system
hello bily this is an excellent suggestion allow me a friendly amendment if i may one of my very best friends is an economic modeler and game theorist hed have a great deal of relevant advice for ccp at the same time he would also be the first to admit that economics and game theory is a reification of the fulsome range of motivations and intentions that characterize the actions of human beings so we might want to extend our search for advice to quantitative and qualitative researchers in the social sciences overall  eg anthropologists geographers historians psychologists political scientists sociologists and the like respectfully delilahfriendsofevewordpresscom
i hadnt really pegged down one particular mode of thought or the proponents of said thought im merely suggesting that with the way this game has developed it might be worth ccps time to seriously consider involving the right kinds of thinkers if theyd like to see this game continue to be played with a possibility of flourishing there probably exists a huge disparity between game development and academia for sandbox mmos this gap will have to close a game like eve can be viewed as a caricature of society or at least certain aspects of it and like real societies when problems arise and the right people dont think about these problems the society collapses eve is going to die if ccp does not legitimately consider the ideas put before them by the csm hopefully the ideas the csm does develop have been thought out in ways that it seems ccp does not have the time to do
you and delilah should get on very well together if i was you that would make me seriously worried
out of my head i can think of a handful of other reasons why eve would die before that one seriously just look up what initially was described as being the csms role and what is the current reality not saying it has become a caricature of the initial plans although id be kinda pressed to find a much more suitable expression
nah dood
thisps the people youre talking about are called appropriately enough game theorists
this is not a troll or a flame but merely an opinion based on previously being in the same corporation as this csm candidate he is not suited for the job he doesnt have a good understanding of eve and i know this through hearing his ideas and plans that regarded the corp at the time also he fits ships mostly incorrectly despite playing since 2002 a viewing of battleclinic only reveals a portion of his inadequacy but i saw many things regarding this user that made me face palm with much certainty however he would be better than ankemafkjefjejff so whatever
because this way you at least have a person to poke and prod and complain to get issues looked at faster all a poll does is give you info to be ignored when it doesnt suit you

your more bothered about sisi skills than actually sortingsuggesting usefull stuff for tq skills on sisi doesnt really matter tbh id rather content of what they had be tested instead of everyone been able to use more ships than they can on tq tbh
id like to support venkuls suggestion here the economic dimension of eve is as important as any other it would be good to learn more about what ccp plans for the economic environment in the future delilah
eve economy issues were raised inside many other discussions also regarding the comment about the line up of csm judging by the amount of isk some delegates have or had please visit your user settings to reenable images we have more then few economy experts here
one of my concerns as i peruse ah trying to decide what proposals to raise is that so many of them have so little support others that are getting good supports are often ones that have already been around for awhile raised in csm meetings passed or failed the csm vote and thus not candidates to be raised again csm has started some discussion with ccp to sort out a quick easy way to mark ah threads so that those which csm has already voted on are visually distinguished somehow would make it a lot easier to sort through there and identify the threads that had not yet been raisedits up to players to rally support for their proposals if i see a proposal with less than a couple dozen reads and majority support from respondents i have to assume that no cares much about that particular issue its difficult to justify raising it in that case
back to the front
hell spend the next 18 months fixing and getting this game to excellence status no more new expansions
i have no problem with ccp skipping an expansion or two just to sit down and iron out the game as it is atm there are many bugs game play issues balance issues etc etc that have needed addressing for a long while heck if it makes em happy they can pretend to make an expansion call it patchathon and all it is is 6months worth of bug fixes gameplay yada yada rolled into one giant 800mb patch
10
1 vote for polishing the game we have now before adding more halfassed features
it really says a lot about ccps credibility when the csms bring this issue to the devs attention the devs strongly insist that they are indeed committed to excellence and nobody believes themtalk is cheap and its easy for ccp to say that theyre committed hell i can say that im the pope but it doesnt make it true the proof is in the pudding and thats some mighty awful pudding

i had originally trained caldari and gallente ships across the board t2 blasters and rails i tried to argue that these weapons were broken nothing happenedso i trained amarr across the board flying the zealot now drives home how bad the eagle and deimos are cr geddon put the mega in perspective mega is terribly inferior lr poc just makes the rokh embarrassing to fly training minmatar now and it seems similar revelations as to the inadequacies of hybrids are in storei guess to the people posting support here dont give up hope but you really should just train something else for the time being hybrids have been the bottom of the pile for over a year now dont hold your breath
hybrids in general are dated  archaic  obsolete with the current game mechanicsi tend to agree that blasters could do with a tracking and damage buff the range would be fine if they did significantly more damage than say pulse lasers
supported blasters need to do moar damage especially since they use vastly more m3 of ammo compared to lasers
also can we have blaster longrange ammo fixed
love the volume counter  insurance ideasas for the rest im not sure how helpful theyd be because i dont live and breathe courier contracts but if it makes couriers lives easier then it gets my vote
well i support thison a related note why is the check for damaged items on the last step of creating an item exhchange contract meaning you have to start all over and search for the damaged item its a pain when youre trying to do hangar cleanup by remote contracting

supported just for the lolsalthough it would suck if it attracted kids to the gallente stations
at first glance it may look stupid but the idea of having different kind of entertainment depending of the faction owning the station would be awesomethere would be girls with s in gallentean station innocent faces like shows in amarrian ones and in blood raiders ones there would be well i dont think id like to know what there is these stations
i absolutely agree with this post but i would like to see these changes applied to a new t2 varient of destroyers known as assault destroyers no rof penalty better pg and cpu and all the other things you mentionedalso i forgot who is the drone heavy race but who ever it is drop thier highslots to like 2 or 3 but let em have a drone bay that can have like 810 small drones or something like that
lol that would be the best destroyer its just makes all other powerless just think of it 5 t2 150mm rails  5 t2 hobs hit orbit at 10km and enjoy the fireworks drones are not for destroyers

supported finally maybe some newbies understand the real value of their drops if they see a flashy meta 4 heavy launcher in the wreck also will make my life easier at salvaging every worthless  and having to right click check info 
i most definately support this as it is irritating to figure exactly what meta level item things are when trying to balance to outfitting of a ship color codes would certainly help
as this was brought up in the dev blog here this was on the list that the csm presented to ccp on aug 16 which can be found here
finally
not for stuff a new player can afford as minerals are mined everywhereyou can fly around there safely too just getting there will be a bit trickier than before and that would be badthe agent system is broken anyways many proposals already brought up dont hang onto something thats archaicphew time for ccp to pull out some more for the other factionsi mean they told us a year ago that their new mission scripting system is so awesome that they could pull out new epic arcs practically every monthsomething to look forward then seems to look good under this point of view noninstantgratificationif you get older you will see that this is good
supported besides the bias that im a pirate and would love more lowsec to kill in i like the idea because it adds as aurum put it flavor to each empire islandkill the eve pangaea make into continentsps if you really support this topic make sure to check the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on box because 1 support just doesnt cut it
and lets say im a pirate so im all for making lowsec between empires because not doing so would be a huge setback to my possible profits you also show bias against having varo set up his research franchise my friend doesnt want this because he makes money moving things in freighters between trade hubs a guy i was talking to in local is a highsec carebear and thinks lowsec is bad bad bad and doesnt want to be forced through it to go to another empireeveryone has a biasnote that was all made up except the part about you but lets just pretend its realedit not supported
what the care bears think will happen brave souls will ship goods across the low sec areas to make huge profits industrialistsntake advantage of scarcity to make profits manufacturing bulky goods near regional market hubs everyone is happywhat will really happen everyone moves to jita every other hisec region perishes pirates camping low sec border gates wonder what they can do to get more care bears out into low sec
naw youre just seeing the usual suspects trying to force players into pirate nests so they can extend their killboard epeensapparently thats supposed to appeal to their victims and make low sec more popular or something
i for one think this would be a great idea it would add another choke point in trade and open up another career for traders i would think this with ccp help allow alliances to set up trade control routes through lowsec as one way to add more game play to eve
supported as long as there are plenty of entry points and the gate guns are also buffed up way too easy and safe for people to sit and tank them getting easy ganks then running off when something looking a bit more that it could defend itself turns up personally id say put scramming and webbing modules as well as the guns on the gates so if someone wants to agress on a gate they also get some risk involved make a timer on it 5  10 minuites seems fair enough time for the ganked to get something together and get revenge
yes more chokepoints is really what eve needshahahahhahahhahahhhahawait you are serious spreading the population out lollets add some realism jita is the biggest trade hub partially due to ignorance there is no real reason to buy a normal t2 fitted ship in jita instead of amarr for example but still enough do the trip so now you want more easy ganks and want to add low sec between the empires tbh would easier solution would be if you could just ask ccp to spawn ncp freighters in your camp but why exactly do you think that after this change which will only lead to the smaller hubs being less stocked will anyone live in gallente space when you can also just run missions in motsu and do your shopping in jita without low sec between itthe main effects will be some easy ganks for pirates and even more crowding in caldari space with less people in space of other empires
signed this gets 1 frp e
this thread definitely needs more thumbs up from failing pirates
its very time consuming to travel through the universe already now no
i dont actually know if removing superhighways will change the population distribution or polarize even more the global market and the empire populationbut the example of yulai gives us some hope about the market decentralizingso ill support this idea
love it make all empire borders in losec
great idea
sounds interesting
1when i first started i thought 00 separated the different empires and was very disappointed to learn that it wasnt only wrong but that we have highsec connections wheres the risk
as long as this doesnt become another rancor one system highway
not supportedand how does this make sense from an rp point of view concord has a mission and part of that mission is to promote peace between the major empires a good step to this would be to create safe space highways so diplomats and such could get from empire to empire without being blown up on route having safe routes for empires traders and citizens also promotes communication friendship and peace removing these routes is not something concord would do from an rp point of view as it would push them years back in their mission
from an rp standpoint seriously those highways should be war zones from an rp standpoint there should be enormous npc fleets shooting people attempting to provide their enemy with aid
not supported just another bs game change to boost one groups style of play with the lame attempt to say it is to make trade better which would do little more than let each region become a cash cow for fatcat economic warlords
suppoted wholeheartedly
personally i thin kthis is a bad ideaall i can see is trade being choked off as no one with a clue would take a freighter into low sec unless they had major firesupport wich would simply put trade into the hands of the power grps onlyi dont see it as increasing but decreasing trade the only other group benefited by this are the pirates welcoem to rancor 27 enjoy your gank err i meant dayi support this idea not being implamented
1 to the idea of making it more likely that high sec regions will have different markets somehow
so wrong its hard to know where to start first the empires are not all at war with each other there are allied npc sides that exist in a state of cold war with the occasional skirmishsecond theres no logical reason why the heavily fortified borders between cold war opponents would be less secure realistically they would be the most secured areas in spacethird the empires use concord for the specific purpose of facilitating trade between them forth under your reasoning theres no reason why there would be a lowsec border between allies either amarrcaldari minmatargallentelastly this whole idea of boost null sec by punishing carebears needs to end they arent gonna go to low sec by force its not going to work its just going to make the eve universe a lot smaller for a huge amount of players ccp knows this  this is why they arent ever gonna remove the highways youd be better off getting behind ideas that ccp might actually implement to bring more peeps into low and null and to create regional markets
i dunno if it has been suggested before but i suggest ccp allow the renameing of pos modules particulary the corp hangers and smasthe simple purpose is just to allow better organisation of poss with a number of similar modulesit would also be nice if we could see only see not put or take into offline corp hangers again
supported
you can name pos modules just not smas and corp hangars use component assembly arrays instead of corp hangars for instance
currently if you try to look at a npc corporations lp store while you do not have any lp points for that corporation you get a message similar to paraphrased you dont have any lp with us so were not going to show you what you could get sod offthis seems illogical and makes no sense  why would someone looking for people to do missions for their corporation not advertise what the corporation can do for you also i want to be able to see what the corporation is offering before i choose to spend my time doing missions for iti know i could look elsewhere on the web but i should be able to do this in game
why do you think that im galvantineim really not lol
well in swg there was a bounty system similar to that described in the op the solution to this problem was that only the guy with the mission who dealt the killing blow could get the bounty and thus clear it on the targetnow in eve this is not as simple since there are no classes but one thing that was done to prevent friendly hunters from getting the bounty mission is that the mission targets were anonymous and you had to retrieve the target name and location with other meansnow there are probably ways to make this work in eve the problem is that probably the benefit is far too low compared to the costs though if i remember ill try to post a way to make this system work
sorry but this seems like it would get abused badly im sure other people have pointed out nothing would prevent me from putting a bounty on a juicy isk hauler or some miner in a belt and then pwning him without worrying about concord try again with your idea bounty system does need a fix but it needs to be fixed in a way that wont get abused to the point of omg wtf emoragequitdo i have any control over what bounty i take or is it assigned randomly
to prevent that sort of abuse it would have to be random and you would be able to refuse 1 mission every say 24 hours or something
thank you for the responses i agree and disagree with somemy suggestions to fixis have a wardec charter system to where you cant get war deced a random you can pay like the idea above a fee for this privilege sorta like paying for be neutralif there is a grievance then there must be a mutual agreement now 4 and below this does not apply if were going to have pirates then we must let piracy flow no more sec hits in low sec if so then this needs to be lightened as in 3 warnings if were going have gate guns in low sec then the need to be more powerful 
my very simple proposal is the implementation of market escrow with sell orders to best explain this i will change the description for the current skill that deals with the already existing mechanic with buy orders margin trading new wiki description i think this would be an interesting addition to the eve market what do you think
it would be fun to name a clone joe
ops point is that when you see gnome kva1000 do you know wtf that is unless youve been playing eve and doing lots of stuff with jumpclones for a while you dont know its easier to set a the jcs name to shield stuff or somethingalso this would only take a max of a day or two and i doubt two to program all jumpclones have a reference number you never see it but thats how the db and client communicate about which jumpclone theyre talking about all youd have to do is link a name to that reference number and add a little bit of uisupported

autocannons should automatically warp scramble you with a 3 point scram that deactivates mwds torpedoes should be switched with boarding torpedoes that have space marines on them that take over the enemys ship and then let you pilot it remotely pulse lasers should simply be doomsdays

even if they donated 80 of each destroyed plex they would still get the 20 as free monies and the prvalue
blow ships up for the greater good hopefully you find a plex in it and it popsUFFFDson did you pop your punisher today the world needs it and if you are lucky it has 30 plexes in it and you help to safe the dayUFFFD UFFFDbut doesnt a popped puni safe the day anywayUFFFD UFFFDhm that has a pointUFFFD
signed good idea
nope seems more like hello kitty than eve world is a harsh place pplus to all the people saying it is money ccp are getting for free need to learn more about buisnesss  the amount of destroyed plexs that get replaced by rl money would be very very low people only got a certain amount of disposable income and once that is gone its gone so in all likelyhood these people with lost unredeemed plexs will either try to pay for it with isk or go inactive as they cant afford it so ccp will lose out on the sub money plus not have the person resub with money
no the pirate party in itself kind of stands against the concept of nda  they are the ones that have been standing up for the sites such as the pirate bay torrent trackers and whatnot even going as far as to host the pirate bay on their own servers where they cant be touched due to the laws involved when it comes to political party private servers they are also planning or already have to start their own party funded isp with no logging what so ever and full user privacy it has caused a bit of controversy lately i wasnt saying wikipedia stands against the concept of nda but instead that the pirate party does  wikipedia just happened to be where the info was on the party that listed evas name which is why i linked itand i know wikipedia and wikileaks are two completely different creatures but i think you may have misunderstood my last post and wanted to clarifynote i am not saying i am for or against the entire concept of the pirate party just bringing it to light as it involves evaahh that would explain it a bit more i was a tad bit confused when reading that im curious to see what you find out though in your digging for further information on the topic
for a minute there i thought i had left this reality and entered into one where eve was not a game but an actual something that mattered then i looked again and reassured myself that yes this is still a game i play for free  and you know what they say about things you get for free you dont really care about it all that much
most definitely
looking at things economically can be helpful to an extent yes raising isk rewards will lead to more people going into low sec however it ignores an even more important factor is it fun going into low sec make low sec more fun and more people will go
actually this is the task of a financial analyst not an economist they need to run risk assessments put together a reasonable beta figure and then run some capm on different activities that can be done in low sec and compare those to their high sec and null sec variantsways to make low sec a valid investment include making a new activity that competes on a fun factor more than an income factor or simply put low sec activities in line with the riskreward of high sec and null sec
thank you dierdra for filling in for me the op has been updated to reflect the new date for this meeting unfortunately mr mynxee and i will be away celebrating our anniversary in a casino on 5 september so you or teadaze or trebor get to fill in for me again
perhaps you should do the meeting the 12 september because perhaps the new trailer  announces ccp will do during the pax will bring new perspectives for many things no 
we do meetings every two weeks regardless the next normally scheduled one would be 11 sept
helloccp you are always so goodarnar gylfason tell us the point in the newsnot to us but to the marketing guysplayers are waiting answers on forum and you go in the external newsccp interview about backlogok 140 people working on the devand some of the features that have been requested or need some loving theoretically we have enough people to work on alongside everything else but there are bottlenecks in the production chain where things fall apart what we are doing however is were taking our focus off these features in general to refactoring older features this is a process that started basically at the beginning of this year and will continue throughout next year till the point where well halt production on new features and turn to refactoring the old features or updating older game designsyou can call it development eras if you want so you add a bunch of new features then you reiterate on those features until youre satisfied that theyre polished in general what you see is and i guess the players have been seeing this and they will be seeing it more in the next release and the next release thereafter is a focus shift to iterationthen men18 months prior any change their plan for their player requestsseems for ccp a bug is just an old feature that need a refactoring never tested to refactor bugshould be a hard job to it to stay 18 monthsyeay

i guessccp will not return old web effect 90 webbed shipccp will not implement crazy ideas about adding special effects to blasters like shield penetration stunning effect webbing effect and otherccp will not give more range to blasters it will blur advantage of laser optimal and ac falloffthe more logical is to increase damage and tracking make blasters outstanding in extremely shortrange engagements if you do not want to change range as for now i do not see advantage of blasters pulses do almost the same damage as blasters 85 at 300 optimal 400 comparing scorch vs nullps do not send me eft fits of 1000 dps brutix and 1450 dps hyperion
well they could boost ships too and balance out fitting reqsinsane atm also they could redesing the whole hybrid ammogun line just like projectilesimho best is to do both

eve online is lacking something really important its the ability to promote eve related services in the game without any external toolsmarketing  merchandising are a really important part of a capitalist economy i wont argue about that ingame store idea that you threw away to never be seen again eve online player business lack of singularity in my opinion  the only singularity is portrayed by the way you treat your customers we need more tools to give ingame business a visual identityi think ccp should develop the mechanics to allow us to advertise and promote eve online related player services  endeavor in stations  and maybe in the far future directly in space  billboards  
i would like to see bounty hunter ads not to mention a better bounty system like jesus how long is this gonna take
exellent ideasupported 1
im all for ui enhancements
its not a new proposal as someone already pointed out but it still needs to be implemented
great idea it would save newbies from the hassle of learning what item is best without checking each one for some items like capacitor rechargers this becomes more difficult because of the amount of items that exist without a meta level
yes
shouldnt be impossibly difficult
updated my original post with the url feel free to check it out and give me any constructive criticism it is not without its problems but it seems to take care of a lot of the most common gripes about poses in one fell swoop
as i understand the argument this is not an effort to boost low sec but is rather a debate that is separate from the whole lowsec problem i believe the people pushing for this change are primarily traders who want a new opportunity to specialize in their professionsi dont see this proposal as punishing carebears either i am curious to know how many people actually use the interempire highways probably not too many outside the afk autopilot tradersi support this proposal for the reasons stated in th op as well as for the reasons stated in the new thread in general discussion on the topic
so youre saying that if an argument is made on merits of one idea that just happens to benefit another idea you canwill ignore this supposed coincidence because the merits of the first idea are absolute and incapable of being corruptedmisused to frame change that otherwise would be less appealing if presented by itself furthermore the fact that the unintended consequences of the first idea have no merit because that isnt what the personpeople arguing for it want you to look at feel free to send someone any amount of isk so the can triple it pay no attention to the fact that people who say that just take your isk and never give it back just listen to what im saying about them tripling your isk cause that is all that is important the other thing isnt so stop talking about it or thinking about it in regards to you giving someone your isk to triple
if the issue is the desire for more opportunities for budding industrialists might i suggest that scarcity or disparity of resources is the mother of tradeit makes no sense to me that someone in caldari space has access to republic security services loyalty point stores for example it makes no sense to me that a station no different to any other in the game hosts 50 of all tradeto increase the scarcity of resources limit lp stores to stations in their own factions space hisec or lowsec doesnt matterto increase the opportunities for new traders limit the number of trades that can be hosted at any one station both by number of trade slots or hangars and by total volume of items per hangar and per station stations designed for logistics would have greater market capacity while stations designed for assembly will have greater manufacturing capacity thus jita 44 would be a good place to build things while jita 46 would be a good place to sell thingslogistics  storage stations would be ideal for large markets assembly plants would be better manufacturing centres refineries would have the higher quality refineries  no more absurd situation of navy stations having the 50 refineries while the mining corporation refinery stations have 35 refineriesfurthermore to add the feeling of space is big give star gates a limit as to how much tonnage they can move per hour a system gate might be able to squeeze through a few dozen battleships per hour a constellation gate might be able to handle double that a region gate double that again and a border gate double again trim these values so that the current volume of traffic through niarjasivala cannot be sustained  why would a system gate perimeterjita be able to sustain the same flow of traffic as a border gatethe market for hisechisec wormholes will be created and there will be further opportunity for those stargates in various missions to become useful for something secret gates to connect to other empire space we would need some way of controlling traffic through stargates such as pilots contacting gate control and being given a window in which they may transit the gate much the same as airports grant windows for aircraft to landtakeoff perhaps the timeconstraint could be replaced with transit fees which are charged in terms of isk per unit weight calculated on an exponentially rising scale based on the volume of gate traffic compared to the design limits of a certain gate typegiven these restrictions  stations being functionally different based on design purpose combined with star gates being functionally different based on design purpose  i would expect trade hubs to shift closer to border or regional gatesthere could be mechanisms ingame for stargates to be upgraded over time the entity controlling certain space could procure gate upgrades which are then applied to a stargate over a period of days or weeks enemies could use repurposed sbus to downgrade a stargate effectively interdicting travel through that gatefaction warfare militias become the entity responsible for maintenance of gates in empire space they would be responsible for both upgrading gates in their space and disrupting gates in enemy space a focussed militia could for example upgrade all the gates between colelie dodixie and sivala in order to provide a high throughput corridor in hisec and increase volume of trade alternately they could disrupt all gates leading into jita or amarr in order to break those marketsthis would give industrial alliances a reason to sponsor faction warfare and give faction warfare a meaningful way of impacting upon the simulated universe of eve
not supportedremoving the high security links between empires will result in even more individual players and corporations move their operations into the already overcrowded caldari space they will not run the low security routes they will just pack up move once and settle back down somewhere they can get to jita in relative safety amarr dodixie and renshek markets will crash and the three related empires will be shadows of their former selves that slowly bleed what little population that stick around to caldari space as those people eventually realize that without the population to buy and sell to and from that there is no recovery
this 
i was going to post the same thing i think this idea would not achieve the ops goal of spreading people out  quite the opposite on the other hand if there were still highsec routes between hubs but it took longer to travel that way or there were other significant costs  barriers to entry tariffs  tolls for example we might see some more varied markets spring up

so your idea is that to make the eve cluster feel larger you need to shrink the space people can useno thanksespecially the part about limiting the tonnage moved by system gates to a few dozen battleshipshour just to point it up 1 battleship is about 100 mil tons 1 freighter about 900 mil tons so what is your bright idea 4 freighter moving minerals in or out of a system and it is locked for an hour a few mission runners doing missions outside a system and it get locked blocking other people play for an hourpirates jumping several times in succession through all the gates save one of a system to lock them so that when a target enter the system it cant leaveminers doing the same to all the gates to lock a system and mine in peace00 subcapital fleets not moving around00 denizens locking all the gates of a cynojammed systemthink about the effects of your proposal
supported
not supported why should we sunder the verse for a select few players profit and enjoyment your interregional  interempire trader and lowsec pirates
i like this idea on one condition there must be several gates through low sec that can get you to the other side if there were only 2 or three between each empire space they would forever be camped by smart bombing mouthbreathers another option would be to allow a high sec path but have that path require an additional 30 jumps or so i think on the whole it would definitely add to the trade aspect of the game and it would also make the different factions more defined as far as rp it would be much better
k so i propose this to reduce big napfests and in the process possibly even some lagedited to form a more clear idea in the opcharge sov holding alliances 1m isk per character on each side of the nap a month to hold blue standings with each other if sov alliance a 500 members wants to blue sov alliance b 1000 members both alliances would pay 15b a month for that standing if sov alliance a wants to blue sov alliance c 1500 members sov alliance a would be paying 35b a month to hold standings with both sov alliance c would be paying 2b a month to hold standings with alliance aif hisec corp a wants to blue hisec corp b and neither hold any sov there is no fee the reason they wouldnt be able to use third party programs to not shoot each other effectively jump bridge routs docking rights easy gang finding would become impossible for the other alliance that doesnt hold the jump bridge or outpostyes some alliances would be able to afford their nap trains but thats alot of isk their paying monthly which would probably mean less super caps and there would be much more smallmedium gang fights you know the fights our beloved tq can actually handle not the 1500 man ones that make us all cry on the forums and yell at our ccp overlordsdiscuss
umm whatyou do realize that blue means theyre on each others friends list basicallyso you want us to pay a fee for having friendsis that what youre sayinghow about we charge people for making new threads on the forumsthe first 10 people to reply get to decide whether it was a good post or bad if its good you get a discount if its bad you get charged extra
yes a fee for having friends outside your corpallianceits the same thing as the monthly alliance fee just more expensivethink of all the major alliances with 2000 members they bring 500 man fleets because of all their pets  allies make their pets  allies pay 2bil  however many members they have every month it gets expensivereduce blobbing and massive 1000 man battles the server cant support anyhow
your idea is generally horrible and as an icing on the cake it doesnt even solve the percieved problem of nap fests this is a multiplayer sandbox game so you want to encourage people to work in groups and dont want to put artificial limits on their actions if you can avoid it there is also the issue that if you force this kind of a mechanism against the players people will just use out of game methods to achieve the same thing basicly your idea would just make a huge number of players ed at ccp for reducing the sandbox and intentionally making the game worse at a time when the game has dozens of real problems that could use some dev love you also force alliances to handle relations primarily out of game for no benefit for anyone
while naps need to be dealt with this isnt it
oh no dont charge alliances that make 80b  per month an extra 200m this will surely break napsactually this will just make no one want to blue new names in 00 because they wont be worth it
musical fist is that you
lol your whole coalition is fail your idea is fail hey i have an idea scout local dont jump in when there are neutsredsquestionable blues in local
i also have a useful suggestion for this post other than my scouting suggestion super point pos module 150 mil shield hp 150 mil armor hp 150 mil structure hp100km point range500 mil isk a day operating cost that should be a small price for all the sov whoring moon goo whoring and 90 carebears in our alliance alliances to pay for a super capital kill120 minute onlining time

marlona hates the idea thats a good enough reason to support it

yeah no supers are meant for killing caps and used for killing towers tbh i think if a person is stupid enough to have a jump freighter or capital by a pos without the proper precautions they need to learn a lesson this would just make some people scared to use supers again like the old days i dont know why but it would
let us ignore characters posts on the forums and in doing so they would not appear in threads while we are logged in nor would their created threads appear to us or be available to viewlikewise link the forum ignore feature to the ingame block list if possible please
supporting my own idea obviously
thumbs up anything for the tea cup kitten 3flees
a good idea nice and simple and if ccp really is rebuilding the forum architecture like theyve said they want to do this would be a really nice nifty little feature to work insupported
would like to also be able to filter by character age as its public infowould be nice to have a little more control over alt posting at the same time
no control over what mission you get it will randomly choose a bounty for you based on your sec status and the amount of bounty the target has on them
make the wardec fee escalate when you wardec the same corporation multiple times in a short timeframe 34 months this will make life for griefers harder and regular wardecs will not be affected as a bonus it encourages corps to live through the wardec or fight back instead of abandoning corp and reforming  wardecing the new corp would only cost the initial amountnot that i care about wardecs anyway you are not supposed to be safe in empire by design
1 balancing risk vs reward would reduce the amount of griefer corps there simply arent enough targets in lowsec unless you gatecamp which is boring and the targets that are there usually arent very juicy pirates usually end up fighting other pirates which is lamemake it so that rats that are in highsec regardless of pve difficulty automatically give half or less of the bounty as rats in lowsec and nerf highsec lp payoutpiratespirates go where the targets are thats why theres so many griefer corps in highsecthat being said it doesnt hurt to allow corporations who get decced to bring in another corp to fight the aggressor corp for free right now its too easy for griefers to dec themselves with alt corps so that mercs cant get involved because of the threedec limit but i dont think most griefer corps do that anyway2 stronger gateguns would reduce the one true form of piracy that is common in lowsec gatecampinghowever nerfing infinipoints in lowsec so that they only work on capital ships would make running through lowsec gates a bit more fair for people who dont have covert ops industrials another good change would be to create more lowsec entry points coupling this with removing the highsec interempire superhighways would bring more targets to lowsec but also make lowsec less dangerous and therefore more profitable
my personal suggestion1 make wardecs a bidding war one side can pay to dec the other side can pay to invalidate equal costs or perhaps less on the defender side potential penalty for deccing smaller corps than yours though this probably wouldnt adversly affect the hisec deccers as their corps are often smaller than the ones they dec thats fine2 gate guns have not kept pace with ship toughness they should not be tankable lowsec pvp is for belts mission sites exploration sites etc leave the gate and station games for 00 except for those who want to try to snipe 150km at lowsec gates lowsec needs a lot more help to get people into it though
i like this idea
not signed the people in eve have ruined this source of profit by hoarding too much materials with several characters at oncealts broke pi if this change went through everyone would have all three of their characters doing this  constantly making the materials that you yield worthless because of the amount being harvested anyone that just uses one account would get yet another setback in evei propose you limit this system to one character per account like skill training then i would approve of this change
the obvious flaw in this silly line of thinking is assuming everyone in eve is participating in pi this isnt the case sorry to burst your bubblesupply is currently not meeting the demand many players bought out the npcs stock and are actively reselling at massive profits which is currently sustaining the market but how long do you think thatll last their stock is finite and when they run out it will be entirely dependent on players like us to fill the marketthere are not enough players participating in pi to sustain the demand plain and simple
you can do any harvestingpvppve activity with multiple accounts the only difference with pi is you are the only one who can access your base until they make command centers network or link up for example if it is pilots working together or one man running a few accounts together the result is the samepi cannot possibly be broken in the way you suggest if the demand for materials is still so high however i agree that the change i propose is likely to make it atractive to many people that are put off by the current system as it stands this will inevitably affect market value and make it tougher or more competative at least to sellif it was implemented as you say so that only one character can run pi per account it would still be an improvement if limitedhowever i think it would be a pointless nerf mostly because pi can pay for seperate new accounts as has allready been said above the only people to benefit would be ccp who get extra subscriptions

instead of the insurance company giving you a mail and a rookie ship every time you dock in a station with a pod how about a station service that requests a rookie ship from the insurance companythis is very annoying especially when im just going around picking skills up
trash it and go around in a shuttle not a pod
if you want a free rookie ship just leave your station and dock in another station where you have no ship its practicly as simple as hitting a button you dont even have to leave system usually as the man said a shuttle is faster and better by far especially for skill shoppingno vote from me

this is where your falcon fleet comes in useful1 wt gets neutral reppers on him2 he aggresses thinking hell be fine3 throw 5 falcons into the mix4 all logis jammed5 wt killed6 7 profit

this is already the case the problem is if the fight is on a station which they frequently are then the neutral reps can dock instantly without waiting for the 60 second aggression timer the only way to counter neutral rr is with lots of ecm which i find irritating and unbalanced why should a neutral player have more effect on a fight than myself or the person im at war withedit supported
only problem with neutral rr is that it gets no timer for redockingjumping through a gate
why its so simple even a caveman could do it2 ships are fightinga 3rd ship approaches and targets ship a to begin rrservers begin querying is this ship attempting to provide rr is this ship associated with either of the combatants do any of the ships involved have aggro timers pending do any of the ships involved have a war dec in progress are either of the combatants using what would otherwise be considered a spider tanking fit is this fight taking place in high sec did any of the pilots involved stay at a holiday inn express last nightseriously its so simple

dear csm membersyou can take a break and make some paper planes with the meeting minutesccp answered not here but in the media and without your review in my understanding
from what i hear though it is very easy to make a lot of isk from ratting in your capital or at least enough to seem big for a mear pvperit would be nice to see a article talking about the economic impact of pi introduction i have noticed how it has made things cost a lot more on the pos fuel and t2 production lines it would also be nice for the devs to lay out some of there longer term ideas for pi personally i wouldnt be surprised if something that they put in soon would take part in t3 production as such t2 is about moon goo i do say though i really enjoy reading the quorate economic report very good read for those long nights of mining
thanks for the response mynxeei wasnt really concerned with which topics end up being raised by csm but rather the reasons csm provides for voting in favor or against something but since you mention issues that have been raised in the past i do not think that should be a bar to reraising an issue perhaps a csm would get voted out because they passed something  or failed to pass something there are other reasons why a csm should be able to undue past csm votes as far as how much people care about particular issues i do not think we have any sort of accuarate guage for that but your assumption certainly seems reasonable
