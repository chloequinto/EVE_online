"i will admit that i like the extra layer of complexity that booster sps can provide. what if they said boosters basically provide a mechanical means to what a crew could provide. so you could buy crew members for your sp according to the different bonuses links give. the minmatar crew would give the bonuses of the skirmish warfare links a different crew member would be required for each bonus, and you could only have that type of crew working together. you don't need to have the whole crew though just for the bonuses you want. also since the crew members provide the bonus that you otherwise get from the boosters you can't add them together. ts way people like me and others who hate the idea of dragging an alt around everywhere could simply by crew members wch provide the same bonuses. the crew members would of course cost isk. i suppose you could set up academies or sometng on planets through pi in order to train them to different levels. you could keep your t3 alts as long as others who don't want alts can still compete. edit: crew members would be destroyed or drop just like other modules in your spmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"proposal quit wning and just play the game"
"posting a bad idea again and again doesn't make it any better, it just shows how bad the idea really is."
"how about unlink plex from everything, aurum/character transfer/etc, and remove them from market. ccp has done nothing but interfere and screw with game time, stop linking it to crap."
"i would think it should be missile boat, who says the 3ed ship should be rails. the rule was broken to start with because for bc's caldari have the ferox already which is basically a rail version of the drake.furthermore caldari are missile specialist, yes they should have gun options but most ships should be missiles. the 2/3 ratio should be maintained in any class of ships.most of all it is redundant, bc's use the same skill, if for some reason you have large hybrids and bc skill trained you can always use the gallente ship for nearly the same effect as the talos."
"guess you make a point, it all depends on what ccp intends, if missiles are the primary or secondary weapon of caldari shipsbut.... having two large hybrid ships for bc's is redundant, if you have bc to 4 and large hybrids to 4 your about as skilled in using either racial ship gallente and caldari, both tier 3 bcs which are glass cannons, so most bonuses are the same, along with fitting (many may opt for the most minimal of tank)."
"l2fit real weapons you caldari slime"
"caldari: missles and hybridsnot the other way around mate. other wise you'd have two races with the same primary weapons systems which would be awkward and unbalanced."
"you already have the drake as a missile thrower.and, for pvp, you really need a good pvp battlecruiser that can do long range instant damage."
"you do reliase caldari and gallante are from the same solar system right. the caldrai were a part of the gallante federation, so of course there main weapons are hybrids."
"every race uses multiple weapons systems. some even use both armor and shield tanking. caldari have plenty of very very good missile ships and now they have a viable hybrid boat, stop crying and train for the rest of your race's weapons, its your (or your corpies') fault for putting yourselves in a limited number of ships.also i like how you say the oracle is meant to use beams caldari tears best tears."
"i said lasers, didn't specify which. and i clearly stated multiple times that i have a good understanding that each race uses multiple weapons systems. i have good skills in just about everything. i can fly 3 races command ships, every cruiser, every bc with weapons, every battle ship, excepting t2 on some of them. i am quite well rounded. and with my corpies, some of them are new. kinda hard to get leet skills in everything without sucking in everything. so they tend to train for the primary weapon groups for their race as it opens up the most ships for the least amount of training. and to doggy dogwoofwoof, they may be from the same solar system, but they have radically different view points on just about everything :) i mean obviously caldari are meant to armor tank since they're from the same system as gallente right point still stands, every major weapons system except missiles had a new ship released. caldari is and always has been primarily missile based, and this new addition skews the balance between hybrid and missile bc's. there are now 4 hybrid bc's while only one missile bc."
"actually if you really want to get technical caldrai were fighter based."
"proof or it didn't happen :p"
"the caldari hoped their small, fast one-man fighters would run circles around the gallente ships. from"
"touche my friend, which brings me to the question of why do drones and unmanned fighters suck so bad with caldari, judging from the lore it should be caldari with the drones and fighters and gallente with the big slow raven type ships :p"
"amarr have missile ships. why wasn't their tier 3 battlecruiser missile based. ccp i demand missiles for this!gallente are known for drones. ccp drones for tier 3 bc!seriously dude, stop crying about this. its not that big a deal. hybrid naga is a pretty cool boat, tell your friends to stop being useless carebears and train something other than missile boats."
"in order to get the most out of their race, caldari must train missiles and hybrids.in order to get the most out of their race, gallente must train drones and hybrids.i don't see the problem here."
"your point is negated by the fact that amarr's primary weapon is lasers, therefore that's what their t3 bc was. seeing a trend here? now quit throwing out stupid points that have nothing to do with the subject, please. oh and drones are also gallente's secondary weapon. point negated yet again, and useless carebears? hardly. i have at least three times your kills mate. kinda negates your carebear argument there."
"no, you specifically said beams. and if you actually did have a good understanding of racial weapons systems then you wouldn't have made this topic. caldari have 2 primary weapons so you can't only train one and expect to fly every new caldari ship right when it comes out. sure hybrids suck(ed?), so its understandable that people wouldn't be inclined to train them over missiles, but ccp stated that they would be getting some love, even after crucible's initial launch. that anyone didn't train them in anticipation of that (especially if it is their own race's weapons) is their own fault.besides 8 torps would have either been totally useless or stupidly overpowered"
"edited, by beams i meant lasers i apologize for being misleading. they have a primary and a secondary. all their combat ships have missile slots, except the naga, however, not all of their ships have hybrid slots. which makes hybrids the secondary weapon system, due to missiles being the more prominent weapon system on caldari ships."
"i'm not even taking that reply seriously. if you can't see why then there is no point wasting time here any longer."
"of course not. it makes sense so i'm not going to reply to it. good choice mate."
"i doesn't make sense because your post implies that ships with hybrid weapon bonuses are actually missile ships. roughly half of caldari ships have missile bonuses while the other half have hybrid weapons. ship bonuses determine what type of ship they are, not their hardpoints."
"confirming the merlin, harpy, moa, eagle, ferox, vulture and rokh have missile bonuses instead of hybrid bonuses.seriously, get over it. half the caldari ships are hybrid boats, specifically favoring railguns rather than blasters. the naga fits in perfectly with that line of ships. a corp mate has one and it's one hell of a sniper bc. in fact it's a hell of a sniper overall. it boasts very impressive dps at 60-100km and i don't think the other tier 3's will be able to compete with it at those ranges. you can't blame anyone but yourself for failing to realize that caldari are not just a missile race and never have been."
"three times my kills???????????????guess that makes my opinion useless.or it makes you a moron for thinking that matters.you decide!hint: you're a moron."
"and which of these has a damage-output higher than \"splashing water on enemies\"?or just buy a drake? at least that doesn't look like a cheap knock-off of the megathron and rifter."
"you do realize that you called me a carebear. so i responded with the fact that i'm sitting around 800 kills where as you're sitting around 200 which would make you a care bear as well.also you do realize how stupid you are right? you call me a carebear and i defend myself stating the amount of kills i have, and you turn around and say that i am somehow saying that means your opinion doesn't matter? i said nothing of the sort and you for some reason can't comprehend that. i clearly said several times that hybrids are the secondary weapons system. learn to read before you come in here and try to troll like you're johnny bad ass or something. and it's not one hell of a sniper ship honestly, it rolls appx 600 dps with maxed out skills with decent tracking at 80km. aint exactly amazing there. as stated multiple times before, i am not saying caldari do not use hybrids, but all of those hybrids have missile slots. the naga doesn't. second point, every other race got a new bc geared towards their main weapons system. caldari did not. i appreciate the bumps guys, but at least try to throw out an argument that holds water rather then some half ass paraphrased excuse for an argument."

"*citation needed."
"first, none of the tier 3 battlecruisers sport a second weapon system, so the naga is in line with the rest of the tier 3 battlecruisers.second, the naga, like the other tier 3 battlecruisers, was built for pvp combat. ccp also decided that it was a good idea to give the caldari a serious pvp ship because the ferox is woefully underpowered as both a railgun and blaster platform. on the other hand, the caldari have what many consider to be the best battlecruiser in the game, the drake. the drake is a solid performer as a missile launcher, and mounts substantial damage and tanking advantages. the big problem is that missile systems, at range, take too much time to reach their target. so, ccp gave caldari a really good railgun platform because it needed one. you should be giggling with joy over the fact that it makes a pretty decent blaster platform too.so, if you are upset that ccp actually gave you some real, substantial pvp ship choices.. be my guest."

"you know... the fw theatre is pretty big. there was a time when blobs ruled the pipes from tama to heyd, but small fights could still be had in backwater systems that were too many jumps away for the blobs to bother with. someday..... someday the blob will return. oms and tama won't be nearly empty for many hours every day. 60 man gallente militia fleets will blob 50 man caldari fleets in abune or sujarento. and when it does, the small gang fights will move out to the hinterlands - away from the blob. odamia, ashitsu, vaarlen - these will be the new home of the small gang fights. these will be the places where legends will be born, where reputations will be made. just like they used to be when the blobs ruled the pipes."
"i, too, share the same vision of lowsec's future and hope we will see a rebirth of faction warfare soon.personally, i've always said \"a blob is just what you call the enemy fleet when you're losing\". lets be honest, eve will always have the element of outnumbering your opponent, theres simply no way to remove that without ruining the sandbox.faction warfare's strength (in concept if not in execution) is that it provides an arena that *potentially* encourages pvp on all scales. i reject the idea that fw is only about small gang warfare, blobs were indeed common back in the day when it was most fun.the problem is, that the scene keeps becoming less diverse as it ages. there used to be the option to join the large battleship fleets, but also elsewhere on a different front lines there would be roaming cruiser and frigate gangs. you used to be able to have a choice where to go fight, not be surprised when there's actually a fleet out and about. there is still pvp around the clock, but usually only in once place at one time.this is really an extension of the same set of problems nullsec faces - constant conflict needs a fat carrot to keep dangling in front of bloodthirsty pvp'ers. there has to be something worth fighting for. this is as critical for small gang or subcap fleet pvp gameplay as it is for the nullsec capital fleet sovereignty-based gameplay. faction warfare held out remarkably long in terms of player interest, before the only remaining players are those who are willing to fish for fights, same as you would anywhere else. it has great potential to provide the large scale \"blob\" fleets once again, as well as maintain impactful opportunities for lower skilled pilots to assist in system takeovers as well. we need to get the whole region hopping again like the golden days of faction warfare, where being fresh and new was strong enough fuel to keep the machine going.fw is running out of gas, its still loads of fun, but it's going to need a top-up for it truly to become everything ccp intended it to be. the players have done their part to keep the embers of fw (and lowsec in general) burning, its time for the developers to stoke the fires once again with some much-needed sovereignty impacts and plexing rewards."

"dude. 13000 bookmarks are more than enough.geez, you rarely leave highsec, why the heck do you need 22000 bookmarks? what percentage of those are in low/nullsec (concord-free space, where, you know, bookmarks are actually useful.)there's being paranoid. and then there's being paranoid overly much. i have zero bookmarks in highsec. i have about 1500 in low/nullsec. no one is stalking you, seamus. other than newbs who watch your awesome tutorial videos, i doubt many people even know who you are. i have some actual enemies and i've yet to be ganked (or even had a gank attempt) on any of my ships in highsec, and i autopilot a lot through high security space. if i don't need 17000 highsec bookmarks (i'm estimating the proportion of your 22000 bookmarks that are highsec bookmarks), you certainly don't. :)start pruning. when you get a collection of 13000 low/nullsec bookmarks, then you can start a thread poo-pooing the limit."
"i have quite a lot of bookmarks and i get a lag spike when opening my people and places, hate to think what 13000 or higher would do.13000 is fine and only extreme situations would call for more and then you could use an alt.. really it's a none issue.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"how many gates are there? how many stations? how many systems? i can think of at least two bookmarks worth having for each of those.the op has the right idea: set up containers and store some of those bookmarks. you're not going to accidentally end up on the other side of the galaxy without warning enough to go change out a few bookmarks. (although, i think you should be able to drop them into your places without consuming the item, making management and duplication a lot less tedious)"
"how many systems are actually worth bookmarking? even in nullsec, if you're deep within your own alliance's territory, there's little point in bookmarking most (if any) of those systems.apparently only one person has reached the 13000 limit (actually he blew past it, since he has 22000 bookmarks), since there's only one thread concerning the limit."
"i'm in favor of making bookmark management less tedious.even as i type this, i'm still shoving bookmarks into containers in a station. it's a bit slow, though, since i can only move 5 at a time, and every 5 bookmarks needed 30 seconds to move when i started, though it's down to about 25 seconds now.i started this thread knowing that i'm an unusual case, but if i really do have more unique bookmarks than any other single capsuleer in new eden, then that means i'm the first or top at something in all of eve online. i'll take that as a personal accomplishment. survivor of teskanen. fan of john rourke. i have video tutorials for eve online on my youtube channel:"
"why do you think there is less risk doing an incursion in low sec than in sov null sec? it would seem to me that low sec and npc null sec would be the most risky places to do incursions. deep in sov null sec would have much less risk.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"i think it's a matter of perspective we're disagreeing on. sov null sec is easier to secure then npc/low for running incursions, assuming you hold sov in the first place. i think you'd agree that showing up to someone else's sov space with your pve fleet to run incursions qualifies as 'risky', right? and that's one of the main reasons high sec incursions are so much more popular then other kinds - highsec runners have their pick of all hisec incursions, while sov holding players have to hope that a null incursion spawns in a region they own and have any hope of securing.as for running incursions in them, we're debating different shades of black here since any low/npc/sov incursion golden fleet can be broken with a cloaky prober with a cyno."
"yes i agree it is easier if you own sov there. it's not easier if you don't. as to whether the pay is out of line, i think there is a easy way to tell. where are incursion run most often and the quickest? if they are run more often in sov null sec than in low sec or npc null sec then we can assume they are better risk reward. or vice versa.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"i wish nda was information was not talked about or at least was the exception rather than the rule. here are the problems:1) its unclear how alliance leaders that are on the csm don't get an advantage from hearing what changes are being made in advance of the other players. is there any clear guidlines on how the csm should act. for example alliance leader csm hears super caps are being nerfed. another leader in his alliance then tells him \"super caps are the **** we are putting all our resources toward creating huge fleets of them.\" how is the csm alliance leader supposed to respond? is he to say well we discussed the future of supercaps at an nda meeting so i must recuse myself from any alliance decision making relating to supercaps?? its insider trading.ok i agree that with any one thing this may not amount to much - just a slight advantage. but when you add it all together anoms nerfed/buffed dreads nerfed buffed basically csm knows all the changes well in advance of other players. 2) even if somehow csm can explain how the above does not give them an advantage it seems to me there is still the appearance of an advantage. this appearance will lead more people to want to join the alliances where the leaders are in the know. this also gives the alliances an advantage.3) most importantly, the nda and csm has just built a wall between players and ccp. csm never really discusses much at all with the players on the forums. and the conversations that do happen are often chilled by the csm worrying they will be anked for overstepping the nda. basically csm has become the receptionist for ccp. when players want to know something csm says <U+FFFD>ccp is unavailable<U+FFFD> and when we ask them its always <U+FFFD>well we can<U+FFFD>t really say what we know because of nda.<U+FFFD> look at the <U+FFFD>discussion<U+FFFD> about the secret meetings with zulu. really why csm at all? zulu knew the players weren<U+FFFD>t happy. couldn<U+FFFD>t zulu himself told the players ccp is reworking things and he will let us know. why did he need csm to tell us that. with new emphasis on nda the csm has become pretty silly. if ccp wants csm to be a focus group to run ideas by then fine but don<U+FFFD>t claim csm is representing views of the players when the players aren<U+FFFD>t even privy to the issues discussed. ccp has bought some good will with the players they no longer need csm to be a buffer. csm should be able to come back from a meeting and tell players about everything they discussed. sure some ideas will be howlers but that<U+FFFD>s not the end of the world. so for these reasons i think the nda discussions should be scrapped and if ccp isn<U+FFFD>t willing to discuss things with the players that should include the players on the csm. short of that there should be precious little that is bound by the nda. otherwise csm is really just acting like a receptionist/wall between players and ccp.btw: i do not mean to suggest anyone on the csm did anything wrong with any nda information. i don<U+FFFD>t pretend to know one way or another. but until i understand what sort of guidelines are followed when it comes to how they deal with nda information its hard to see that their alliances are not reaping benefits. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"so i really like the new (but used to be old) ship trails. but they disappear when you zoom out too much. i was in a big fleet fight this morning and even zoomed in i could only see my own ship trail and whichever poor sucker i was orbiting at 500. everyone else in the massive blob was too far away to see engine trails.now based on the recent incarna complaints people will pitch a fit if this game will not run on their ibm aptiva 2168. but for the rest of us i'd be nice if you could zoom out and see everyone's ship trails. just glancing at the battlefield you could see the momentum of battle and tell where everyone is drifting to. go play old homeworld 2 for a bit to see what i mean. the ship trails could not only look good but be a little informative.but to accommodate everyone's computers we'll probably need a sliding scale of ship trails.trails off: for everyone who got this game in 2004 and refuses to let the man tell them when to get a new graphics card.low: basically engine trails look the same as they do now. if you can handle crucible now you can handle it on low.medium: most of the engine trails are clearly visible and you can tell how a fleet is flying just based on a screenshot. (the game looks like homeworld)high: space is a giant streaky mess. it looks like the flying spaghetti monster got blitzed on jager-bombs, decided to paint himself blue, and do some freestyle break-dancing outside the amamake in gate.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"i like the idea in general, but there may be some resource constraints that make it hard to do. i shall inquire..."
"i was afraid of that, but hopefully all of the processing that goes into making ship trails happens entirely on the client's side. then the only limitation on ship trails would be how awesome your pc was.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"yes just for that reason. let it be ccp"
"ok rather than imposing artificial limits on people's behavior (limiting the amount of systems an alliance can claim or the amount of blues they can have) let's look at the what motivates people to form these giant power blocks and see if we can take away the things that motivate people to create a universe that we don't like (huge nap fests, giant blob warfare)the reason for this is that people will try to get round whatever rules you put in place. take a look at the practice of can flipping, it's a bit of a mechanics exploit, but it exists for the simple reason that people like shooting at other people. and they'll navigate around the aggression rules to do what they wanted to do to begin with.even if what i say after this point is completely wrong i still think we should work on the motivation of large blobs forming rather than the means by which they form.so why do big power blocks exist? or rather why do people feel the need to form them?well so far i have come up with two reasons off the top of my head and i think we can work on one of them.the first reason is that blobs win, and if you have a blob harassing you, the way to beat it is with a bigger blob. having 100 noobs in you fleet flying drakes is useful. but having 1,000 noobs in drakes is even better. i don't know if this concept will ever go away so i am just going to ignore that elephant in the room for now. granted getting rid of jump bridges would really hinder someone's ability to batphone a blob in.the second reason i think is the presence of rare, valuable, and monopolizable resources that only an alliance can hold, (tech moons in particular). and for the most part these are resources that your average grunt will not care about.so as an example ask yourself how much space (in jumps) do you need to enjoy the game? how many jumps would you go from your home station on a daily basis to rat or mine in? how many jumps would you go to buy something expensive or large (like a new ship, or a faction module)? and how many jumps would you go to start roaming?i don't know about you but i would say i'd be willing to 3 jumps to run a haven every day (this is about the size of an alliance's home pocket). i'd go 10 jumps to the local market hub to drag an expensive cta battleship or logi back home all by myself. and i'd like my roams to start at most 20 jumps from home. try throwing up a roaming fleet advert in alliance and tell people that the first fleet destination is 30 jumps out before you are going to start looking for targets, see how many people join your fleet.so if the average nullsec pilot would probably prefer to live their life in under 20 jumps, why do they have a sea of blues wrapping around most of nullsec?. and (in addition to the ability to batphone a blob) i would guess that it's the alliance as an entity is motivated to spread across space so it can take and hold as many rare and valuable resources as it can. this most obvious example of this i can think of is rare moon goo, although i was impressed with the whole gellente ice interdiction.i could be completely wrong here but what do you guys think would happen to large alliances if tech moons were more common and drove down the moon goo price, or if the refined products of tech moons could also be produced by pi?i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"no.no.no.listen. limits of this nature are dumb, and they will just be worked around by making alt alliances. and don't come here and tell me you want to limit the alliances we can make, and limit \"how many blues\" an alliance or corp can have.meh. i think you'll find that modifying space itself will be more work than it's worth.i think you'll find that what needs to be done isn't anywhere close to what you're thinking. what needs to be done is make sov descriptive rather than prescriptive, and activity-based. want to hold a region? **** you, use it. when someone lives in a space, and has system control most of the time, it's theirs. the instant they move on and someone else actually starts using it, it's theirs.limits. pfwah."
"specific nullsec industries needs huge boosts to make it worthwhile and reincentivize living in space for grunts. add new low-end roids that spawn in null that go far beyonf a mere +10% bonus, or make a capital-class strip mining module. maybe rorquals will finally be seen outside a pos.nerf jump freighters/the whole \"cyno supply train\" so that all goods and materials aren't completely centralized in jita. have it so that pi can have planets to run a manufacturing slots, opening up null for non-capital class manufacturing (while running a deficit, not surplus of food and power pi items).retool null archae/hacking sites so that the average site is worth more then the average anomaly site. oh and buff anoms.indirectly nerf highsec by making it more dangerous to live there (increasing cost of operation). patch wardec loopholes, the bounty system, npc corp invulnerability."
"1) buff truesec. there are so many -0.1 systems and very few -0.8 - (-0.9)2) bring back sov upgrades, but increase the difficulties of the levels while weighing the benefits3) require upkeep of these systems, and prevent this sort of minimal occupation. consecutie systems should be claimed, and in order to upgrade some systems they need to have control of the systems around it. 4) there needs to be the ability to put more than one station per system. with established sov an alliance should be able to put manned, destructible sentries on stations and gates. 5) high end ore should deplete, and fluctuate. remove moon minerals completely, and slap the goo on comets. the comets move slow enough to where once found they can be mined for several months.6) remove belts completely. why even have them? just have them spawn on d scan randomly every day. the fact that systems have 5-15 belts on average is just dumb anyway. do this everywhere and make mining interesting.7) change loot tables.. abcs should be profitable to mine in null. speaking of which, does anyone even use a rorqual for mining ops anymore? something changed- when i first started it was desired to do mining ops for ark or bistot."
"qfe+1i think these changes would be great. i also heartily agree with point 3, so long as upkeep requires more than just isk, but also diverse resources."
"you must fly the phoenix, then, right?"
"lol wut.i forgot about those pesky nanotowers."
"this thread perfectly exemplifies what's wrong with the gm's.as long as the issues were easy, scripted responses, the gms were all over it.as soon as things got hard, with specific criticisms and issues- they're nowhere to be found."
"since dictor bubbles now cause agression on deployment: if your ship is destroyed in the dictor's bubble, regardless of warp initiation the dictor pilot should be on the km.if you force a 70m uninsurable paperthin ship to go down every time it wants to do its job, it should get some credit for being a hero.edit: this goes for blues too, so if the dictor pilot is freaking genius and bubbles his own fleet in a massacre it's well known who's it was."

"here's to realistic movement./emote slow-clap"
"you people do realize that majority of people that do use t3 gang links operate in small gangs. all your proposal does is promotes blobs and makes solo/small gang pvp even less viable."
"they are not used solo. there is no reason to think they are used by small groups more than large groups. the proposal just makes it so you do not need to multibox an alt t3 with gang links to be competitive. but like i said before if there were a way to give the bonuses and allow others who do not want to multibox alts a way to be competitive i wouldn't mind so much.i will admit that i like the extra layer of complexity that booster ships can provide. what if they said boosters basically provide a mechanical means to what a crew could provide. so you could buy crew members for your ship according to the different bonuses links give. the minmatar crew would give the bonuses of the skirmish warfare links a different crew member would be required for each bonus, and you could only have that type of crew working together. you don't need to have the whole crew though just for the bonuses you want. also since the crew members provide the bonus that you otherwise get from the boosters you can't add them together. this way people like me and others who hate the idea of dragging an alt around everywhere could simply by crew members which provide the same bonuses. the crew members would of course cost isk. i suppose you could set up academies or something on planets through pi in order to train them to different levels. you could keep your t3 alts as long as others who don't want alts can still compete. crew members would be destroyed or drop just like other modules in your shipmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"it's a curious question - why do learning implants exist? how can their continued existence be justified? you need them to train your hyperoptimized per/will skillplan as fast as possible, sure, but why should you need them to begin with?let me begin by highlighting the problems with learning implants:they discourage people from playing eve. you're still paying your subscription, sure, but you're not playing the game. you don't want to jump to your empty/combat clone and lose a day of \"optimal\" training so you can have some fun, and then have to jump back to your training clone the next day. this affects nullsec (especially wormhole) players doubly so - losing your ship in a bubble is a surefire way to get podded. people in empire still have a better chance of warping their pods out of harm's way, and thus have no qualms about running missions or otherwise ~flying in space~ with their implants, unless of course they are at war. that, however, is not our playstyle. they are seeded exclusively through lp stores rather than being made in-game entirely. characters that need pirate faction implants for any reason (supercapital pilots with slave/nomad sets, freighter/jf pilots with nomads, etc.) are essentially stuck with +3s. but this isn't about pirate implants. so what i'm proposing is removing learning implants entirely. there is just no need for them. add 5 base points to every attribute. remove learning bonuses from all other implants and set all base attributes to 22 points. it's trivial. leave the cerebral accelerator implant as is - 25 \"effective\" base points for all attributes for the month isn't quite gamebreaking. a refund plan would not even need to be considered - those who had +5 sets will still have the same bonus, those who had +4 sets will have a better bonus, and it doesn't put anyone at a disadvantage.it's a simple change, it doesn't throw anything out of balance, and it just makes sense. why the hell not? \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"posters attitude is typical of high sec carebears like him. the point of learning implants is to give an advantage to people who don't die and create a greater death penalty for people who die and are bad at pvp. this is something he might find exciting and intriguing if he were to join an actual corp and move to 0.0, which i recommend for him."

"i have first hand experience with this.my own brother started playing eve recently. yesterday i asked if he wanted go along with me on a 2 man roam to be my tacklebro. he didn't want to go because he would have to travel 40 jumps to get to where i was and he would have to podjump to get there quickly, wiping out his +3s i gave him.instead he logged off and played some starcraft.this is a bad thing for eve."
"as the main implant importer and seller for test, i can do nothing but support this despite what it would mean for my business ventures.i have first hand experience in not undocking which led me to not actually playing for my first six months since a friend gave me my first +5s. he thought he was doing me a favour but it nearly made me one less player instead."

"pod ganking thrashers are test reimbursable now c/d?"
"learning implants discourage playing the game (\"having fun\") and instead turn it into a paint drying simulator where players are discouraged from going out on that enjoyable destroyer op because \"noo my +5s\"."
"this reminds me of an old thread that had a fairly interesting proposal on how to fix this problem. the idea was more or less to have learning boosters that temporarily (maybe 24h) give you a boost in an attribute, each taking a different booster slot, each giving a bonus in a different attribute, coming in different grades ranging from +1 boosts to +5 boosts. these implants would not stack with implants so if you already have implants the boosters wouldn't do anything, unless the booster effect is higher than the implants. so if you have +3 implants and inject a +4 booster you will have a +4 bonus for the duration of the booster.i personally liked this idea since it mean that i for a small cost can pvp without losing training time and not having to risk my learning implants, while at the same time having the drawback that i would have to spend some extra isk each time i want to pvp."
"why are people so desperate to cling to the restrictions that learning attributes and implants give us?"
"i like the learning booster replacement. a lot."
"supported.learning implants are definitely a barrier to flying in space. i've seen it a thousand times. i've even done it myself when i was a newbie and isk-poor.while you're at it, get rid of neural remaps. i don't want to hear \"i can't train up battlecruisers/battleships/whatever for another x months because i am on my super-optimized int/mem map for int/mem support skills!\" ever again. there's a lot of newbies denying themselves fun ships to fly because they're obsessed with optimized training times. but thats another issue."
"hell, while we're at it, let's take out the learning queuelearning skills are optional."
"i kept trying to rationalise keeping learning implants but not sure if i can, however i think i have come to the conclusion that it is not the learning implants that are the barrier as in my high sec clone i have more combat implants that are just as expensive that i would also not want to risk losing.i would rather shorten the jump clone timer to say 12hrs. that said i still think that the combat implants are more interesting to use and so would probably still support the proposal."
"typing a lot of words doesn't make this idea any less terrible.you should feel ashamed for posting this and subjecting us to your foolishness. i suggest you edit this thread and change it to a formal apology to everyone that comes here and who may have read this atrocious idea.i will be waiting. i expect this done in no more than 24 hours from the time of my posting."

"the whole take too much time only counts for the first volley, typically takes 10 seconds max to hit the target from range, and then its rof from there on out, so it's not as huge of an issue as people make it. it makes a pretty good blaster boat with pretty much no tank. so it makes a fairly bad blaster boat overall. you can have 1200 dps on a ship but if you die within 5 seconds it isn't gonna do ya much. as far as having a real pvp ship choice.. if i want to use the new tier 3 i have to go to one of the other races.. or stick with my drakes. i'll probably keep to my drakes, since its extremely effective pvp wise, i just wish ccp had actually given caldari a good ship, rather then a talos disguised as a caldari ship."
"what if the talos is actually a naga disguised as a gallante ship?"
"less the case ya. but by the way have you read the lore? drones are the main gallente weapon system. though ccp hates on drones normaly more then missiles though both got poked in the eye this time.but ya hybirds are still crap. drones and missiles are the best thing going for gallente and caldari ships."
"personally i view drones as more of an auxiliary weapons system rather then a main one, since pretty much every one uses drones. i just don't like the lack of love for missiles :ptheir biggest drawback is simply that it takes time for the first volley to hit... after that it's the exact same as a hybrid weapon. and for those 5-7 seconds people hate on missiles, it just doesn't make much sense :p"
"miniers involvement in fwthe faction warfare missions when i played were quick and fast played one person in a speed tanker and the other in a dps ships like a stealth bomber with a targeting laser.could there be a mission or even strong hold that would only let a procure through fit and fit an ice harvester on to grab npc ice to be completed for mission.the value of the mission would be higher than most as it required an escort of a non cloak-able ship(it only has 1 high fitted with an ice harvester) a set amount of time has to be sent ice mining - maybe 2 blocks - the ship won't have much of a tank on it so the rate guarding the belt may be a problem.it make the mission of escort the diplomat (the procurer) and his papers (npc ice) a style of mission not seen in fwgrant you there are short cuts like take powler to local station, fit ship, do mission return to station with ice, package ship and return home. with ore in powler. but at the belt the guarding of the procurer would be interesting)______________________________________________________________________________________________npcs effected by fw (immersion)would be interesting for stations in fw space to close their doors to the opposing faction players: there would be some stations in the opposing space as they were loyal to the race they belong to.

"some kind of rebalancing has to happen between sleeper salvage drops and t3 building.the fact is, nanoribbons are the only valuable salvage b/c of various bottlenecks to the point that all other salvage is often not even worth carrying around because there is so much of it on the market comparatively. a while ago (on the old forums) there was a long discussion in either markets or sci/ind about exactly why this is true and why it is as bad as it is, but it would be nice if salvage was more balanced.

"one of the things i'll do this weekend is write up notes about the threads.i don't expect them to do it formally, but some devs may do it informally. csm meetings tend to be more high-level than particular feature discussions, but the lists are still helpful, especially if a csm doesn't have direct experience with a particular aspect of the game. and we can point the devs to the thread.we usually write up a shared document (in etherpad, for example) to keep notes.i try not to let my personal preferences influence me too much. that's one reason i did the crowdsourcing."

"it makes sense that you'd void insurance on self-destruct. it makes sense that you'd not generate loot when you self-destruct. i've seen no justification in this thread other than \"it's dumb\" for a self destruct to generate a kill mail for the attacker.if you can't kill the ship before the timer, then no km for you. better, self-destructing ought to be like a giant smart bomb and damage everyone nearby. if you can take down an aggressor with that last desperate act, so much the better.but \"it should generate a kill mail because it's 'dumb' that it does not\" is not a good reason."

"two part proposal: - add a module into the game that allows for a chance to deactivate a cloaking device.- eliminate the ability for people to frag warp a ship. this is an exploit in my opinion and is abused on every ship type. current state: eve-online has to for lack of a better term become eve cloaks-online. everyone flys ships that can cloak. cloaks can be fitted on nearly any class of ship. there needs to be a module that can counter act this effect in my opinion. the anti-cloaking device would only be allowed to be fit on a light interdictor or heavy interdictor and would have the same penalty as the current warp disruption field generator module, where a player would not be able to be remote repped or helped in anyway while the module is active."
"i agree with this and will add that i would also support another designated ship type whose designed purpose is for that anti-cloaking device."
"suggesting a solution for a problem (or two) that isn't there. well, i guess it's about par for this forum."
"as you are too much of a coward to live in nullsec and too stupid to adapt so you decide to die and cry all i can recommend is you go back to highsec its called afk cloaking for a reason they are afk and if they aint whats the problem dont like having cloaked ships around your intel channels/system security not up to scratchwell guess what thats your own fault cry more"
"look at thisbot, they already have the modules in the game already. there are modules for all other issues in the game, why not a de-cloaking device?"
"what is frag warping? unfamiliar with the term.also, no to a decloaker. i like watching people dock up because a non-blue is in their system. and yes, i stay at the computer. i do read a book though."
"fragwarping is using a non-covops cloak and a mwd to be able to warp as soon as you decloak.if ccp considers this a bug being exploited, they should patch it.as for the ability to decloak ships: just no. there would no point in a cloaking device if every wormhole corp and nullsec alliance could just pull out the magic decloaker whenever they felt like it. you're not talking about balance, you're talking about nerfing it to near uselessness."
"not unless you make the range around 10km, no falcon or other cloaky ship should be that close to a target while cloaked anyways, its designed to aid you in decloaking a ship in your immediate vicinity.ccp does not consider the frag warping a bug and working as intended."
"it means you need to defrag your warp drive every 5000 lightyears or so. otherwise you start leaving little bits of antimatter all over star systems and it just gets messy and cluttered (not to mention the possible damage caused by said antimatter chunks. if you hit one going at 10+ au, it could total your frig)."
"oh look, its this thread...again.there is nothing broken about cloaking mechanics other than your inability to comprehend and adequately counter them. good day sir."
"again the circular nature of these forums is revealed.the mwd and cloak trick has been raised many, many (oh so many) times and ccp has stated it is a valid tactic, have a remote sebo alt on grid boosting your interceptors if someone escaping your gate camp is that much of a problem for you.as to afk cloaking, i suppose it can be annoying if your on the receiving end and are of a delicate disposition but with proper organisation it isn't a real problem."
"we've tried that"
"by making money shop mandatory by giving game advantage, even with seemingly innocuous things like neural remaps and clone jumps, you're asking the hell to break loose. whoever in your management has the ridiculous idea that people will pay an arm and a leg to play a game need to sober before real damage is done. and damage will not be done to playerbase which will leave for greener pastures, be it wow or rift or sw:tor, but ccp.paying subscription and on top of it having mandatory microtransactions is unacceptable. most posters in the thread share my sentiment, i'm certain. and i smell the rat, now rmt is just for conveniences, just like before was only for vanity stuff. what's next, i wonder?and by the way, get rid of aurum and make nex store stuff purchasable with plex directly, if buying it for the isk makes your management uncomfortable, though because these currencies are interchangeable, nex items are available for isk. more than one currency feels horribly contrived."
"this. i am scared to death by ccp constantly bringing up micro-transactions. ccp used to pride itself on making a smart game that stood out. yet every time i turn around they want to do what works for cookie cutter mmo's that don't hang around for more than a couple years. i know this thread isn't meant for ccp directly but could you guys on the csm try extremely hard to drive home the fact that eve is inherently not your run of the mill mmo, and thus strategies meant for run of the mill mmo's will probably not work for their product? i feel like this was something they understood at some point.more on topic:vanity only.preferably none at all."
"make a market where items will be selling by players for rm and cpp will have % from it is good idea better then microtransactions.but i<U+FFFD>m afraid something like this"
"don't let up on this. \"vanity\" itself is a very dodgy and entirely subjective concept. one man's vanity is another man's content and once you start imposing artificial dividers between grades of content you open a pandoras box that ruins the integrity of the sandbox. we pay a sub, we get eve online. thats about as complicated as it needs to get. screw nex and microtransactions and the horse they rode in on to be honest!and the people in this thread still arguing that ccp need extra income do need to realize that things have changed in a pretty serious way this year. allow me to explain with a friendly illustration! ccp games is a successful professional father. he manages to pay the bills, and invest in the future of his only daughter \"eve\". eve is bright and original, lovely to talk to and manages to impress everyone as she's growing up with her quirky independence and feisty joie de vivre.then a few years ago ccp games met a mascara-wearing floozy with fake breasts and a penchant for dressing up her twin chihuahua muts in mink waistcoats. the name of the floozy was \"world of darkness\" and almost immediately she started spending ccp's money. hard working successful ccp soon found itself pressed for cash as world of darkness wined and dined a succession of long-haired poetic emo types and slept late after drinking all his wine and eating his larder bare.then even worse! world of darkness brought her unlovable adolescent son (from her first failed marrage) dust 514 into the house. playing loud industrial house music and snorting crystal meth at all hours of the night dust repeatedly broke all the furniture and invited thieves and pimps to squat on the living room floor and set up their mt/nex rackets in the front garden (because \"everyone else is doing it!\")between them world and darkness and dust came close to bankrupting poor old ccp dad, and while the goth harlot tapped his bank account for investments into the experimental \"work\" of internationally-reknowned fashion artistes \"monocle and $1000 jeans\", the horrible teenage stepson was trying to corrupt poor little eve into turning mt tricks on the street corner for small change to fund his meth habit (because \"daddy needs your help with the bills\") those players who believe encouraging this situation is the right approach (by finding excuses for mt) are simply abusing poor eve and betraying the hard working professional dad while overlooking the real cause of the crisis (an appalling girlfriend and her nasty teenage son). so what happened this autumn is that some of ccp dad's friends (the good player base) came round and talked things over (some with baseball bats). ccp woke up to the reality of the situation and threw world of darkness out on her skanky backside and hurled her suitcases out on the street. dust 514 promised to clean up his act and is now on best behavior and eve can finally come out of her room again without being paraded in cheap tarty underwear for the mt meth addicts to ogle at. ccp dad tearfully apologies to eve and promises never to get into bed with noxious slappers again in the future.so. the morale of this story is that the biggest challenge to ccp \"dad's\" income was resolved when the slutty-sleeparound world of darkness got booted out on the street. there is no longer any need to have eve turn mt tricks to pay the rent. sure dust 514 is still living with us but he turns 16 next summer and will then need to get his own job and place and sink and swim on his own.eve will keep growing and everyone is happy.the end. (we don't need microtransactions in eve.)"
"agree.get rid of all stats.i dont see concord out here collecting info so it has to go ;)"
"the contradictory factor in this post is astounding.you support making wormholes more dark and mysterious, yet you want more information on what wormhole bonus may be affecting a system? i think you need to rethink that buddy."
"i completely disagree. i disagree with the removal of the api data for wormholes, and i object to removing any more data from them.consider what it takes to live in a wormhole. there is no local, there is no concord, there is no market, there is no moon mining, no sovereignty, no jump clones, no static asteroid belts, no ice fields, no regularly spawning rats. if you're podkilled you get ejected to k-space and have to wait until there's an opening that you can get back through. you live under the constant threat of ambush, and must pound d-scan to have any degree of personal security. it's already incredibly challenging to make a life in that sandbox. making it harder does not make it more mysterious, it makes it more annoying.the api data was a small advantage that could give a wormhole settler some idea of activity in the system. it wasn't real time information, jumps (like kills) show up up to an hour after the fact. it takes resourcefulness and dedication to utilize the api.concord doesn't watch over nulsec either, so should the api data be removed there, too?if you want an rp explanation, try this. jumping the vast distances of space has many subtle, yet far reaching effects on spacetime. technologies used by modern capsuleers allows them to roughly interpret these effects and estimate the number of jumps to or from a given system. it's not concord keeping track, it is your ship detecting quantum particle spin aggregation through a eilfer matrix; which we all know is standard issue in navigation computers.don't make living in wormholes harder than it already is. especially at the behest of wormhole tourists and gankers who already have enough advantages over the inhabitants.do any of the people who +1'd actually live in a wormhole?"
"agree. remove everything. jumps, npc kills, ship kills, pod kills. (though those last two will show up on killboards, but that requires a bit more work).wormholes should be \"the unknown\" they advertise themselves as."
"god forbid you actually have to face the unknown in unknown space...."
"wormhole bonus is a static information; jumps and kills are dynamic information.you may see it as a contradiction, but it actually makes perfect sense when you compare it to other bonuses.take your ship, would you prefer if the bonus were hidden and were only available on a website? would this make it more 'mysterious'? no, it doesn't. it just makes it a hassle to remember all the bonus by heart.same thing with wormholes bonus; it would be nice to have that information available in game. right now, what we have is a message for half a second after we jump saying \"your ships is being affect by the system...\" - i'm not entirely sure what it says since i never get to read it all. it's easy to tell the wormhole bonus from the background though, so bonus are not something hidden; you only need to do a research on the web and connect the dots. i would just like to have that information available in the game.in short, wormhole bonus being unknown does not add to the mystery of the wormhole, so it's not a contradiction."
"its still information. the lack of information would mean unknown. the fact that information is provided means that is one less thing that is \"unknown.\" the way it should have been:no static dump of the information...no ccp provided information on exactly numbers for what changes were madeimagine that. all you received was a message \"weird effects on your ship\" and you could see some changes in space. now it would be on the players to figure out what exactly is changed. it would be on the players to face the unknown and possibly decipher it.would it be harder? absolutely. would players eventually compile the information into a database? probably.but at least we would truly have to endure the unknown. its easy mode right now."
"i realize that the words \"unknown\" and \"mysterious\" are frequently used when discussing wormholes, but i think you're being too literal if you interpret those word as some kind of mandate. wormholes are what ccp makes them to be, and i think it is a bad idea to further limit a third of the systems in the game in pursuit of an adjective.if the best argument for removing the api is because it increases ignorance, then i don't see it as justified. under the same argument, one could crusade to make d-scan useless in wormholes, or to make static wormholes to go to random places, or to make it impossible to tell how long a wormhole will stay open or how much mass it can take. in the pursuit of \"i have no idea what is going on\" you could stop showing the names of anomalies and let the pilots roll the dice and see if they land on grid at a class 1 perimeter camp or a class 6 core bastion. all of these examples make things more unknown, and all of these ideas are dumb.if you need a word to cling to, try arcane or esoteric."
"why i would like to see this change is simplemissiles dont work verry good in space. missiles depend on explosion force to do their damage. but an explosion needs air to travel trough. and in space there is no air for the explosion to travel trough. the only damage a missile does do is the kinetic damage of the impact and em radiation damage from a certain nuclear payload. heat damage and explosion damage is kind of rediculouse.so would vote for some new weapon. something like disruptors.this is an energy beam that disrupts molecular bonds of the targets thus doing damage to it.heat damage would work like a microwave disruptor beam agitating the molecules in the target.kinetic dmage would not be possible explosion dmage would be difficult ( still thinking on that one)em damge would exist of a high radiation disruptor beamcaldari would be a heat and em damage race like amarrammo would exist of disruptor energy crystals.fix the missiles once and for all by getting them out of the game entirelyreplace all missile skills by disruptor skills of the same level"
"go away"
"but.. my immersion."
"1) explosive damage in eve comes from a big burst of sub-atomic particles headed at you, not a wave of pressure (go look at a proton smartbomb). the reason that it's called \"explosive\" damage is because of the fact its associated with nuclear warheads.2) shrapnel still works in space (we know that from space junk and micrometeroids irl), that or you just drive a big fat ke penetrator straight into the target."
"i have two pos-es in hisec. keep the defence modules turned off to save resources. the fuel blocks will triple my lox burn rate and add 25% to my deo2 burn rate. slight decreses in other items to not compensate for this. also adds extra step of having to manufacture the fuel blocks and move them to the pos storagethanks for your consideration."
"supporting this because it benefits some lone hi-sec dude and his two little towers. **** everyone else who asked for this change!(not really)"
"awwwwww your personal high sec poss will no longer be profitable?how terrible working as intended, get friends.also, an extra step? thats absolutely great. its one more step people can make money off of. its also a step that enables pos logistics to be much easier."
"i'm gonna agree that the needs of your one man corp far outweigh the hassle that is fueling towers for the vast majority of tower fuelers, aka the 0.0 alliances. risk free play is what ccp is about, so your proposal makes perfect sense. we should enable play styles such as your where you only interact with others via the market, if that counter doesn't tick over on your isk as fast as you want you'd probably unsubscribe."
"admitting to giving the op the \"like\"...not because i agree though. i saw how many the op had and laughed...then i felt bad. negative kharma sucks so i \"liked\".now...stop badposting."

"there are tons of good information on dust514.org scroll dow to the interview with halldor fannan."
"just saying...i think it would be epic to see the crapton of engine trails in warp from a fleet of 50 ships. the engine trails should be visible as far as the eye can see behind you while in warp and disappear at the same speed you decelerate when you leave warp. anybody else think this would be cool?"
"prices of pi commodites have increased considerably since crucible introduced the tremendous increase in import and export taxes. this runaway inflation will eventually affect many other aspects of eve.recommend the taxes be cut in half and the csm monitor the situation and be empowered to order adjustment in the rates as needed to keep the economy moving. (interesting how this issue follows rl developments with various economic situations)this could be a quarterly review to start.one other idea to mitigate would be to significantly increase the storage capacity of the control center, perhaps to 50,000 m3. this would allow a way to bypass taxes on the outbound launches and would reduce the amount of time needed to operate a pi complex. would not solve the problem of import taxes, but there are ways around that.thanks for reading / fly safe"
"this has to be a troll. are you serious? if the csm was able to adjust the taxes on high sec pi they'd increase them. you know the csm is packed with 0.0 delegates right?"
"not a troll, simplt unaware of any 0.0 bias of csm. thought they represented all of us with equal vigor.so maybe plan b is best, increase capacity of the control center."
"see? this is why you don't sink sp into new \"features.\" you don't know when ccp will remove that \"feature\" for everyone except 6% of the playerbase whose subscription they deem superior than yours for some reason.this is why eve has 350k subs after 8 years, half of them alts the other half bots."
"no"
"actually the best plan would probably be for you to think about the game in a holistic way, rather than what impact any given chance has on your income. then again, you could just escape the bonds of empire, and fly free in 0.0 space. also you don't really know anything about economics, so please don't try to pretend like an increase in pi costs via taxation is going to create runaway inflation. it's merely going to shift the market a bit. in part because eve basically can't sustain a futures market due to trust issues, there's not going to speculation driven spikes in commodities prices, so equilibrium will be reestablished quickly where pi production is moved to places with lower taxes aka low sec or null sec.it's almost like that was the intent of the change - to remove another zero risk isk faucet, and move production of pi to places where players can interact with each other, through space boat violence."
"no. move to lowsec."
"go an d do hisec incursions for 10 minutes.. that should cover your months pi taxes."
"i thought this was going to be about scaling trails to the size of the engine they're from, because ("
"depends...i think making the trails too thick would look silly."
"ship trails add nothing to the game. i would just as soon see them go away"
"you add nothing to eve. i would just as soon see you go away."
"i'm concerned that player owned customs offices are being thought of as a means to drive conflict and encourage small gang work. as it stands it really doesn't happen because right now there is no way to inerrupt productivity of a planet as it appears the resources keep being produced and piling up until the gantry is out of reinforced mode. i'd like to make it more urgent to defend these structures by making it so that reinforcing the gantry/customs office stops production planetside. eg like in moon mining poses. a pos in reinforced mode does not produce moon goo (cpu based modules go offline) so should pi structures. alternatively, perhaps make it so its possible to raid planetary resources when you reinforce the customs office. what it boils down to, is imo there should be consequences for owning more space than you can reasonably police. right now, there aren't and thats a bit sad."
"regarding sov, i've written another proposal for the csm that covers the issues with territorial warfare:"
"the pay out for the hulk is in line with other ship of the tech 2 designtech2 ships are meant to be the lure for people to use and loose - higher reward = higher risk.stick with the covetor if your hulk is getting shot as the insurance the same as the hulk but the price of the hull is 1/9 of the price"
"dont fly what you cant afford to lose."
"i totally agree that the wardec mechanism need to to be updated! i think this is a good start. i don't necessarily like the platform thing but i am not oppose to it either."
"bananaphone! \o/"
"if you get past the ky, and look at the idea objectively:- may not make sense for outlaw factions but: would make sense for concord to jail hisec gankers for 24 hours."

"or we could just add a launcher hardpoint to both the moros and the revelation and an additional launcher hardpoint to the nag. problem solved the ccp way!"
"greetings,those of you who scan down explorations sites on a regular basis are aware that the best time to find them is immediately following downtime, as this is when many of them spawn. this is quite inconvenient for those of us who live in the us, as downtime is between 3am-6am and not the best eve playing time.i would like to ask for a greater randomization in the timing of these spawns rather than a whole bunch appearing after downtime. keep the number that spawn over the course of a day the same, just spread it out better over the course of a day so there are some left by the time us evening rolls around. no one should have an advantage based solely upon the timezone they do/dont live in.thanks."
"actually, all of us who actually do exploration know that that's complete and utter crap. sites respawn right after they despawn./thread"
"im not talking about ****** gravimetric/magnetometric sites, im talking null ded plexes. come back when you learn something son."
"that's actually what i was talking about too. all sites use the same respawning mechanic. it would behoove you to learn what you're talking about before you start throwing around insults."
"having ran these sites for 4 months, i know for a very solid fact that, yes, they are far more likely to spawn after downtime and much easier to find. experience has very clearly shown me this. if youre trolling then go find some other thread. if you havent figured this out yet, well go give it a try sometime. the mechanics on this need to be fixed."
"sounds like you're suffering from 'proof of the null hypothesis'. the respawning mechanics are well known by most explorers. if you choose to ignore the facts, there's not much that can be done for you.*shrug* to use a quote i'm fond of \"you can't argue with all the fools in the world. it's easier to let them have their way, then trick them when they're not paying attention.\" (though there's no tricking needed in this case)edit: and sites are ever so slightly more likely to respawn at dt, but only the 0.000000001% of sites that don't get completed for 3 days will respawn then. however, the amount of sites who get left sitting there half-run for three days is so small as to be completely and utterly insignificant."
"you're quite wrong actually, and only making yourself look like an idiot by continuing to post like this.sites will respawn at downtime only if their despawn timer has been started (i.e. by going to the site). this varies by site types but ultimately it means that when the timer is done and the site has still yet to be completed, the site will respawn somewhere else following the next downtime.this is why we often see \"stock piles\" of sites in systems that are not visited. these sites do not get their timer triggered and thus sit idle for days."
"i live in the us and i frequently find multiple ded 4/10s per hour."
"having run these sites for about 14 months, i know for a very solid fact that you're wrong.next you're going to be saying that mnr got stealth nerfed with the latest patch or something..."
"reduced jump clone timers would work in a pinch, but in my opinion learning implants are dumb and, well, nobody has come forward with a reasonable objection to their removal, just forum alts parroting \"risk risk risk\" crap. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"i mean yes, there should be increased risk in nullsec in relation to empire, but being forced to keep implant clones in empire is more of a punishment than a ~consequence~edit: i realize that mining barge insurance payouts matter a lot to a lot of people but really i'm bumping this \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"i haven't had a implant in for atleast 6 months now, can't say i miss them.also have 2 clones with full plus +4s and assorted hardwirings. haven't used them in nearly 7 months."
"risk should only apply to ppl other than myself. empire carebears should have their pimpboats ganked and lose everything they own, that's fair risk. but i should be able to get podded with zero loss in null bubble. because i'm not a hypocrite like that."
"didn't i say to come back with your main? \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"it does sound reasonable like that.i personally like that dying and losing a pod is a big deal, but if they replaced the learning attributes with more combat stats, then there would still be a good reason to get implants."
"except you won't be as compelled to put combat implants in a pod that'll get bubbled. oh wait, that's the whole point - ensure your null podkill produce zero loss.wow is that way ->"

"it does seem weird that all of the other anoms were balanced (buffed) and all the drone regions got was a nerf."
"perhaps incentive to.....desire other space?"
"maybe you should make a cartel on the minerals you get from the alloys.because thats the real problem here.drone anoms aren't a fixed isk give out like the others, don't expect them to get buffed when the problem is the one your creating.your suggestion is really dumb because what you want will increase the amount of minerals taht would be produced from drone anoms, there by causing the price to fall on them, there for once again causing the anom to not be as good as regular anoms. not to mention this would wreck mineral prices."
"i never meant that to be a suggestion, just the comment that they could double it and it still wouldn't pay out as much. this was to put into perspective how lacking they are compared to the other sites. the way i should have phrased it was \"they could double the value of these sites and it still wouldn't be the same\". there are a lot of ways they could adjust this value. as i posted in another thread, i'll leave it up to ccp to balance it, i'm only pointing out the problem. sorry if i phrased that to make it sound like i thought it was a proper fix.i don't think making a cartel out of the minerals is a proper solution either. assuming that drone alloys are really what is ruining the mineral market (i'm not certain they are or aren't, i'm not a market guy, and for all the talk i've seen i have yet to see numbers), thousands of pilots can't just sit on their minerals and hope that they double or more in value while they get no income, not to mention how the market would get flooded once they reached a valuable level. all this time hoping bots and other miners don't start making up the difference, preventing prices from even getting that high. income is necessary just like anywhere else in the game. any problem we are creating is out of necessity, we need isk, our sites give minerals. we turn minerals into isk and use that to pay sov bills, fit our ships, etc.again though, i'm only pointing out the problem. i really don't care how it's corrected, but seeing every region of eve get balanced and ccp not even commenting on when (or if) they will do something with the drone regions doesn't fill me with hope."

"this is a massive (pun intended) problem for wh dwellers. please read"
"i propose that when characters eventually walk around stations there be an actual location (station vaults) where your inventory is stored. in these vaults, you will be able to see the items that you have there, move the crates and pallets around and organize them as you see fit (or have drones auto-organize it for you if you don't care). you will be able to walk around in your warehouse, get a conception of the volume your items take up, and generally marvel at your growing hoard. this is not a proposal to replace the inventory list by any means, just to give that list more dimensions.further, you could have to pay rent to stations for storage. perhaps the station would charge more for larger and/or more secure storage facilities? if this is implemented, i would recommend that whatever fees on basic, unsecured storage be very minor.i would also suggest that players be able to try and hack their way into other people's vaults. once inside, there could be a way for them to steal things (reprogram forklift drones to move the goods to a waiting vehicle, or transport tube). there could be an array of security measures purchased by the owner (automated defense guns, detection grids, etc.) put in place to protect the vault. if you want to think ambitious, some commodities like slaver hounds and militants would naturally serve as vault defense. i would suggest that station security (roving security drones, cameras, etc.) scale in accordance with the security status of the station; the security patrols in the dark hallways of a losec station would be less frequent than the well lit halls of vaults in hisec. one thing to consider is what happens to those who get caught? death and a new medical clone seems relatively light punishment if you have a thief jumpclone. can an owner insure versus theft? could this lead to insurance fraud? is that a bad thing?these additions would accomplish the following goals: give players a greater feeling that things in their inventory actually exist. they take up space and would be easy to see how much (volume and quantity) of something you have, not just a number on a spreadsheet. encourage hoarders to put items on the market rather than paying for storage indefinitely. indulge those players that would enjoy being overly anal in organizing their gear. facilitate player creation of station security theory. people would talk about effective anti theft strategies, and evaluate the various countermeasures' usefulness. thieves would film their crimes, blog about their techniques and gloat about their biggest hauls. offer a new challenge to capsuleers, and possibly even introduce a whole new occupation of people specialize in station theft. this could lead to a new type of mercenary who targets assets of corps and individuals. more skills to learn. hacking a station vault would require a whole new set of skills. maybe thieving gear/clothes would have to be bought with aur? i appreciate your input. this is a big can of worms and admittedly it is a huge pipe dream, but what do you think?"
"i like the new fuel block. it will make my life a lot easier when refilling the fuel bay. also, if the price is good, it means i won't have to constantly check for what is missing in the fuel bay.if pos fuel becomes a widespread problem, then i'm sure ccp will look into it. until then, if you're unable to pay the maintenance fee, than find something else. share a pos with a corp or a friend to cut down on cost. there's always something else, and worse case, you just make less isk."

"i propose the following changes: awakening in a clone incurs a negative effect called neurotransfer shock that lasts for a while. you cannot undock with neurotransfer shock (rp justification: the doctors won't let you fly a starship in that state). the med bay sells a service (a drug) that clears the effects of neurotransfer shock but this costs isk. the amount of isk required scales with sp but remains constant after 54.6 million sp at 7.8 million isk (equivalent to buying a clone grade pi) you do not have to keep your clone up to date. you cannot lose sp in this system. you only pay to get back into action quick. the duration of neurotransmitter shock also scales with sp and reaches a maximum of x (1 hour perhaps?) at 54.6 million sp. the minimum is 10 minutes for very low sp players. the way i see it, there need not be the possibility of losing sp due to forgetfulness. also clone costs for high sp players is too high, it discourages them to to pvp in smaller ships or situations where there is substantial risk of podding. i have come up with this system to address these two points. numbers are pretty much arbitrarily chosen here to illustrate the idea."
"nope, remember to keep your clone up to date."
"have warpgates with extra restrictions for ship type and ship amounts. so only a set number of ships can enter like 1v1 and for teams have a set number of groups(2/4/6). a channel in cq for spectators. no rewards but have stat tracking. no auto queue or teleport to arena you have to still fly to the system. if your group disbands your warped out of the group arena. have time limits 20/30 mins after last activation."

"implants grant you bonuses. some bonus learning speed, others bonus combat stats. simple as that. the argument for removing attribute implants could also be applied to gunnery/missile hardwirings. there is no difference. eve is very much a game about choices. you can learn faster or you can be cheaper or you can use pirate/fw implants for other bonuses. but you must make a choice and that's important in games like eve. the simple fact is you don't need implants at all to raise your skills, it just takes slightly longer without them. care to know what the difference between my +5 set and a +3 pirate implant set is on the 50d skills i train nowadays? about 5 days. 24 hours of being in the +3 combat implants isn't going to make more than maybe an hour or two difference on that.i'm ok with adjusting the clone jump timer, hell i'm ok with setting it to a simple 30s session change timer. but the attribute implants are nothing like the learning skills. learning skills costed basically nothing and you didn't lose them when you got podded. implants you do. using implants, even attribute ones, is no different than slapping some faction gear on your ship other than it's obviously strapped to your pod instead."

"you fail at reading comprehension. please try again."
"reducing the jump clone timer (or removing it out right) has the same effect so vov you're just ramblingalthough i do fear that it'd lead to ~strategic~ placement of jump clones and allow large alliances to essentially run multiple campaigns at once in opposite sides of the galaxy and be able to react far better to attacks on allies, again, in opposite sides of the galaxy. have you considered that? replacing learning implants with +5 to the base values of all five attributes is a better solution. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"i plugged in +4s as soon as the lp store was introduced and the price fell to 20m. kept right on pvping and living in nullsec the whole 4 years.yeah i've lost a few sets, but the overhead was more than acceptable for the reward. if the horrible prospect of losing 36m isk worth or implants is keeping you from pvping now, then removing implants won't stop you being a huge risk-averse baby. you'll just find some other reason."
"removing attribute implants means you can just self destruct your pod and instantly jump across eve as well. the only practical difference here is changing the timer doesn't remove an important game element. that said, i'm completely fine with things the way they are in regards to implants/clone jumping and i think you'll find that most others are as well.and as has been stated, if the thought of losing 50m isk in implants keeps you from pvping, then i'm pretty sure you wouldn't risk that 60m isk drake either. so yeah, you aren't going to pvp in this game no matter what i happens i think."
"attack the argument, not the person."
"i'm not a risk-averse baby who is scared of losing implants, hell, i pvp with +4s and i have extra sets on hand. i don't have an insane amount of isk, but implants aren't a dent on my wallet. that's not the case for everyone, though, is it?are you forgetting that the guy who gets podded has, in 99% of cases, lost his ship at some point prior? popping someone's faction cruiser/hac/t3 inflicts a visible loss, doesn't it?it's not about me wanting to skill faster, it's about a bad game mechanic. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"you're entitled to your opinion but i think it's a good game mechanic. you pay isk to train skills faster and risk losing that bonus if you engage in risky activities. what is so wrong with that?"
"you can't remove it completely, that would screw things up hard. but i'm in favor of, instead of removing learning implants, introduce the much discussed skill to reduce clone timer. 1-2h per level should do the trick nicely."
"they're a relic. it's basically the same thing as learning skills. oblivious, new players screw themselves over by not getting them as soon as possible. it's yet another mechanic that alienates them. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"there is no good argument in favour of 24 hour jump clone timers, learning implants and arbitrary learning attributes.i'd like to see someone from ccp defend having to stay a year remapped into charisma because you want to be an fc."
"yes, learning implants suck.we need more combat, more pirate implants. perhaps some t3 implants."
"stopped playing eve because of learning implants. 5 times. in a row. now i have two metal plates in my brain. feels cold."
"here's an idea to kick around. lets say that ccp decides not to remove learning implants from the game (a very good probability.) how about charging a base isk amount to set the jump-clone timer to 0? it could be modified by the total levels of implants (learning and combat) implanted in your clone, and perhaps additionally modified by the number of hours left before you could normally jump-clone again?this way, if you had x number of hours left before you could jump-clone, and something came up, you would have the option to jump-clone immediately.this does not solve the problem of the isk strapped pilots, but it would promote flexibility and fun (pvp) in the game."
"i remember that thread and this idea is my favorite so far."
"near as can tell, the jump clone timer is helpful for keeping folk from bouncing from one end of space to the other at will and with no consequences. sort of like the old jump bridges, come to think of it; at least, that was the argument made for nerfing them. but anyways. essentially, the current system encourages players, especially nullsec and lowsec residents, to develop a \"home base,\" because it prevents a nullsec resident from bouncing to high-sec at will to grind isk, then instantly jumping back to null for a fleet op, or jump cloning for a fleet op in stain and then jumping back to geminate to run sanctums. so currently, jump cloning has moderate drawbacks, and forces a player to weigh whether jump cloning is worth it, or whether he should wait or find an alternate route for accomplishing what he wants. removing the timer might lead more players to live in high-sec and only jump clone up for major fleets, reducing null population. or it might not, for those players who already have high-sec alts grinding missions or incursions. i do know that it'd be nice to be able to hop down to high-sec once in a while for pve without worrying about missing a fleet op.also not sure whether removing the learning implants is good or bad, if only because they probably serve as a useful isk and lp sink. the big issue with learning skills was that they (1) were functionally mandatory and (2) kept players from getting into ships and doing fun stuff early on because they felt compelled to train learning skills. learning implants aren't considered mandatory, because their effects are relatively small, to the point where players who actively pvp won't bother to inject implants into the game, the training time for them is fairly short, and the +1 to +3 implants are cheap enough that even active pvpers can afford to replace one or two of them, while new players can probably save up enough to buy them without it significantly affecting their gameplay, if at all. at least, i had no issue affording a full set of +3 implants when i started, and a set of +4 implants was a nice goal once i got into a battleship. those at risk of losing implants through pvp have to make a choice between faster training time or losing isk when podded. but that's fairly similar to the effect learning implants had on new players, even if older players should be able to balance cost and benefit better, so i wouldn't consider it a terrible loss for the game if learning implants were removed. if attributes are boosted as well, then it would definitely be a minor benefit for those who actively pvp, though doubt it would really affect newer players all that much. removing attributes themselves sounds kind of messy, and i'm not sure who it would really benefit, if anyone. new players already start off with a generic attribute distribution, and so aren't locked into anything. nor does the game force a player to remap attributes. this character spent two years with an even attribute distribution, because i had no real idea what i would train even two months down the road and didn't want to be locked into a training plan; even though others were training faster than this character, i don't think attributes or remap timers really hurt me in any way, or stopped me from having fun, but maybe i'm just an oddball. in general, i like meaningful choice, and it seems as though attributes and remaps provide that -- a player who knows what he wants can remap and train for it quickly, while a player who doesn't can stick with an even attribute distribution and train slightly slower, but with the option of training for something else at any time."
"that's like sayin amarr has too many laser ships and not enough missile boats o.o and the rokh itself is outmatched when compared to other ships of it's variant, don't get me wrong i still use it and love it, but it just doesn't match up to the other tier 3 battleships."
"i'm just going to throw this out there, it's my opinion after looking at all four tier 3 bc's that the naga, with it's rails, is in fact the best of them. so quit your whining already."
"oh no, now if you want to fly a caldari pve missile boat, youre only limited to drakes, ravens, and tengus missiles are horrible for pvp, so if you made the naga a missile boat its primary purpose would be for pve. if you want to fly a pve missile boat, use one of the above, as any of them would be more effective at pve.so if you made the naga as a missile boat, it would be useless in pvp and outclassed by 3 other ships in pve, essentially making it a useless novelty.its working as intended, get over it, move along with your life."

"the mwd trick is imho pretty lame, but i suspect ccp are letting it be because they can't fix it, rather than because they don't want to.as for general cloaking, meh, seems fine to me. if you really need to kill stuff that badly litter the gate/bubble with drones and hope you get lucky."
"this again. really?cloaking is working as intended. it is the most balanced mechanic in the game actually.while cloaked the pilot of a ship cannot do the following:- target- engage- utilize ewar- get close to anything (or risk being decloaked)while afk the \"pilot\" of the ship cannot do the following:- anythingso, what mechanic here is broken that needs to be addressed other than the fact that you may need to get psychatric help for your irrational fear of things that you cannot see.i am the one who exists in shadow. i am the devil your parents warned you about."
"everyone uses a cloaking shiper whatit would be easier to list the ships that commonly use themcovert opsindustrials and other ships traveling not trying to get into fightswarp indicators, or other ships that are background support ships.fitting them to any other ship gimps ganking and pve for lock times which are pretty important for the very fast and slow locking ships. ever look to fittings for any commonly used pure fighting ship and notice the lack of them. also the fact you have to use a highslot that could be used for a different utility or in the case of a perfect layout ship that has 8 weapon slots, more guns. also anything but covert ops can't warp and cloak.covert ups this does not apply, they are also expensive tech 2 glass cannons. tech 1 ships in the same weight class or higher class or tech 2 in the same that is pure fighter can beat them. so if fighting them keep in mind that any ship fit with a cloak is gimped in either being a expensive glass canno covert ops, or a different ship gimped in other ways"
"i don't think you understood what the op is qqing about. my guess is he's more bothered by mwd tricking dominix pilots and the like than covert ops ships. which is fair enough really.although adding cloak jammers would really be too far. cloaked t3s that can warp around, swap subs, and plex with impunity are somewhat annoying, and i know where the op is coming from, but without them low/null pve would be impossible outside of deep blue sov space.maybe add cloak jammers, but give cov ops cloaks immunity to them? at least then the mwd trick would still work against most gatecamps, and covert ops wouldn't be broken beyond repair."
"problem: to the limited extent to which this pathetic excuse for a csm has achieved any tangible results, they have represented their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the game. they have no incentive to look out for the best interests of the game (as csm v did) or to act professionally (as csm v did) because their constituency is composed of a bunch of ******** neckbeards.solution: 1. strengthen the eligibility requirements for the next csm election so that only active accounts that have been active for at least 6 months total are eligible to vote.2. give each eligible account 1 vote. that vote may be cast for or against any single candidate (not both.)any candidate with a negative vote total would not be eligible to serve on csm in any capacity that cycle."
"talking about theft and first person shooter mechanism in eve seems a bit premature. your idea of thieving seems highly unfair though. training a thieving skill and stealing people's stuff like you do in skyrim simply doesn't work in eve. the risk and potential of retaliation should be equal to the potential gain, and to me, your idea just sounds like a quick isk grab without risk; you target a player that's offline and steal their assets without any chance of them fighting back.the idea of limited cargo is interesting though. i know a lot of people hoard material to make a profit later on. it would be interesting if stations had limited space and extra space had to be bought with isk.i mostly like the idea because it's an isk sink, and most of the time, only the wealthy player have enough stuff to justify expanding the station cargo."
"i agree. i know a few people who would go absolutely insane at the idea that anyone could steal their stuff. perhaps though, there is a way to balance the risk and potential for retaliation with the gain, as you say? oh, and i wasn't thinking about this as turning into splinter cell; i was imagining a mini-game (maybe similar to how they handled hacking in bioshock). i don't really have a mental image in my head about what it looks like in the vault, or how anything works beyond that point.is is totally broken, or is there a way to make it fair and fun?"
"no, stealing in eve shouldn't be a mini game. there's already other more appropriate ways of stealing from people; you blow up their ship, ninja salvage, destroy their pos or scam them in some way. those are appropriate ways of stealing in eve.stealing cargo and commandeering ships is the sort of things you can expect from dust 514, but it doesn't necessarily have a place in eve. if there was a hacking mini-game, it should be kept to pve encounters."
"one perk came from incarna and development of1. better avatars, able to repose them at moments noticei have had avatars from before the improvement that happened years before the incarna re-release. they were really bad compared to the new ones. i spent 15 dollars for a one time change to avatar to the first improvement because the initial ones (that were unchanging) were that bad. then incarna avatars came, and for fweee at any time i could change it, that's a big improvement.the big downfall was the lack of any player interaction during release, and subsequent releases. add to that, the incarna part is really graphics intensive. doing the single player game with a few rooms is overwhelming my cpu. now add larger station environments, multiple people yea, no wonder it hit a rock wall. even now months latter, new expansion multiple races captain quarters are being released, not the full or real incarna.relating to that, axing went on with the clothing shop and world of darkness."
"i refuse to get excited about incarna until i can find the neutral market alt in my station, kick open the door to his little apartment, and shoot him directly in the face.ccp if you make this happen i will buy all the \"men's precision boots\" you wanti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"another thought to the world of darkness thing. i think its good they stopped it, but they can always try it again. though i think the majority of the staff working on that are still around should refocus on the incarna game. then after that is playable with multiple people then they can go expand on it same engine to the world of darkness thing. maybe reusing the same backgrounds too, i think cyberpunk, city's and castles and landscape would all fit nicely inside of the mammoth sized stations. lore and physics wise the stations are huge, nearly deathstar scale being the size of 10 or 50 titans. the space faring people including pod pilots are opulently wealthy to a scale unmatched by any king of a past era, so they can recreate just about anything to a hearts content. also reuse avatars and clothing. human is human after all, and vampires are basically altered humans.going back to my experience navigating the single player game. if the backgrounds are larger then one room, really need lots of fast and very fast travel, fast walking running. airports have walkways and scooters going around. elevators going multiple directions and railways.another thing to add sometime after a multiplier incarna (not really super important as other things driving people to a social environment) is a way to go to a personal assets warehouse, and have other players be invited to go in too. being able to see every item in the game with the scale of a person would be awesome. not the most important thing but some down the road. might need to have npc's on cranes moving the items around out of your hanger when you sell them, and to access them for better viewing."

"physically it looks like they can dock in stations but, they should be 10 times the size of a regular carrier. half the size of a titan. hell i would think a carrier should be anywhere twice to 10 times its current size, then scale the super even greater.super caps are supercaps, not everything needs to be able to dock in station, but maybe a secure way of keeping in a pos should exist without the juggernaut of current pos corp roles, and setting up personal ones."
"wield in what way?in game i think the alliance leaders who are also on csm will do better in general than those who are not on csm. outside the game i think we saw people unsubscribing en mass that influenced ccp.i think we saw csm often explain that they couldn't say much due to nda so players never really knew what was going on.i'm not sure if you include my post in the collection of \"tinfoil\" but i'm sure even you could see that the nda was onerous this time around. why not make it so the nda is the exception and not the rule? that is make it so csm can discuss with the players they supposedly represent about what they discussed with ccp unless there is clear indication it is nda? now it seems the other way around. it seems you can't discuss anything with he players unless ccp says you can. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"the one thing csm has been slacking on, is, ironically, communication with the playerbase. except for trebor and two step the csms rarely give input on discussions the forum (especially ass. hall, which is supposed to be the official venue)."
"good then csm seems to agree with me. maybe that will be a topic of conversation. to say \"ccp dictate nda's, not the csm\" is irrelevant. ccp dictates *everything* in game but this is a meeting between ccp and csm. so csm could presumably discuss things that they want changed - liked the extremely overbearing nda cloud that looms over their communication with players.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"players can set up arenas, and tournaments, for no or high rewards.also regulated by players. in anyway they see fit.if outside of corp, do it in lowsec, so concord does not intervene.the advantage and disadvantage of eve is that it is freeform game, a player driven stimulation. any game mechanic can be used to any end, chaos is a star that points outward giving limitless freedom to order.one could set up a arena, sounds like a cool idea. have betting too."
"not possible under current game mechanics that does not allow it. oh wait, you know that already."
"currently wrecks all have the same amount of hit points and it is a very, very small amount. it makes no sense at all for a titan wreck or anything else massive to have the same tiny wreck that a frigate would have. the ship is dead, but the hull should not just vanish with one alpha shot from a frigate or a few warrior drones.what i would like to propose for all wrecks is for them to have the same base stats as the ship without including any skills.so a taranis wreck would have 1,858 ehp while a erebus wreck would have 2,931,086 ehp. a vast difference and more realistic. it would take on the same traits as an unpiloted ship with nothing fit on it.salvaging wrecks also seems unrealistic. it seems fine if there is only one person salvaging a wreck, but what about when say 50 people are trying to salvage a super carrier wreck. from start to finish the entire wreck is salvaged in just a couple seconds and the entire salvage goes to one lucky guy. that is ridiculous on several levels. the larger the wreck the more salvage parts drop which is fine, but the process to salvage a whole wreck should be relevant to the size of the wreck. also all the salvage should not go to one lucky person like it was a lottery.when a wreck is spawned the salvage parts are determined. access difficulty is now changed to reduction in salvager cycle time. one cycle from the salvager produces one unit of salvage.salvaging is now turned into an actual process of sifting through a wreck and pulling out the usable parts. also the lottery feel is gone."

"dear trebor,as you see in here there are more question marks than answers provided and they all circle around the center problem of information/communication to the community behind the status quo. dust514 is supposed to be released this summer and it will be a first in the gaming world as two platforms interact together. this is a major task going online with the next eve summer extension and might be underestimated by many even within ccp, tecnically like content wise.the question of how those systems work together must be better explained and in detail.features should be introduced by devs on the forum to get sufficient feedback. i will name here the example of occ (orbital command center) these occ<U+FFFD>s are supposed to be installed at planets as recently the poco<U+FFFD>s and serve as command center for merch<U+FFFD>s (ps3) but as i read there are attackable form players in space (pc) like poco<U+FFFD>s. now how does that work together? once d514 feature is in it<U+FFFD>s final stage a dev blog should present this feature to gather additional player feedback. i understand ccp don<U+FFFD>t want to give the ahhhhh<U+FFFD>wooow...., effect away, but finding better and deeper information<U+FFFD>s abot the d514 development on a fan page rathere than on the official page is once again a short coming of public relations to a new type of interaction and first in the gaming industry by both, the technical as the content aspect. more transparency and a heighten effort to communicate with the player base (dev blogs) should be a priority question to the ccp management. summer is just 6-7 month away. to support the interested ps3 community to participate prior to the release of d514 there should be ways enabled (pre-subscriptions) which allows the ps3 community to access eve gate and this forum prior to the release of the game on their platform."
"at near light speed travel all the light in front of you would blue shift to gamma rays and you wouldn't be able to see it. in fact, it would fry you.what needs fixing is trails from other ships you see warping in. for some reason, the graphical engine plots some swirly trails, instead of straight ones matching the warpin trajectory. i'm guessing it's related to the same issue that makes ships warp in sideways, i.e. not facing their direction of travel."

"why do you cling on arbitrary entitlement of +5 while having fun? or arbitrary zero loss when podded? action and consequence, where's yours?train without +5, problem solved. what? you're entitled to +5?"
"why do you refuse to post with your main? \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"i wholeheartedly support this proposal. it would be a hard decision if stats actually affected the game beyond skill training, but they don't. relegate the learning implants to the darkest pits of oblivion and add more boosting implants in their place. yeah, kids these days and their entitlement to play eve."
"risk vs reward is good, but are attribute implants or attributes really necessary? i would say anything that discourages activity should be removed, encouraging more activity is a good thing.that way, a person could train as fast regardless of implants, so people might use some, or none. implantless body, who cares ill train just as fast.a person could use a 60 mil drake, but what if they pvp in a much lighter ship due to lack of funds.going with that, younger chars likely every skillpoint counts because they can't do as cool stuff otherwise (be the pro with the tech 2 ship with the tech 2 fit). for example me, losing training time on my main doesn't mean as much being that i can do just about anything from fly a hulk to carrier, and every racial bs, and a slew of tech 2 ships. if you reach a certain point as a established char, you just try to think of long skills to train for obscure bonus that is not even necessary for you.same think with implants, tens to hundred or so million is a portion of my wealth, to the noob that's like everything. anything encouraging more fights is a good thing, more new people in the game, people less hesitant in general.keep clone costs still obviously, maybe bump them up a bit to make up for people not spending isk on learning implants."
"i think the real damn problem is that it would take 37.5 years to train all skills to 5. which is ridiculously stupid. skill training has been seriously flawed from the beginning. it is horrendously slow, and takes entirely too long. eve isn't going to be around forever people, or atleast not this incarnation of it. it is almost nine years old. i think at max training time of say 4-6 years is more in line with reality."
"no thanks. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"admittedly the removal of learning skills has made the implants nearly useless. a full set of +4s has only knocked off 2 days off my current skill plan. but the removal of both should by all reason be accompanied by faster training times. say something close to what you would have gotten with all lss to 5 and a set of +5 implants to be fair."
"what?"
"signed+5 implants are much too expensive to be bothered with anyway."

"currently sd generates no record of the loss, either for the pilot, or the killer.if you don't want to generate a mail for the killer, then at the very least the pilot who self destructs should generate a personal api verified loss that shows his self as the player that landed the final blow.we don't care who gets the mail, as long as some evidence of the pilots final minutes is generated."

"danthomir wrote: denies intel on fittings because ship scanners are so hard to come by. if i want to know what you fly, a disposable alt in a frig with sebos and a scanner can get that intel in less than a second. besides that, i'd love to know just how much your lossmails say about you that you feel the need to protect that as \"intel\". ccp has said that killmails are a crucial part of the game, enhancing them with implants on podmails. what's more, concord kills give killmails to the player (if there is one) that does the most damage. i see no reason to do sd any differently."
"not really, this is the current situation, dreads in siege, the fc's address book lights up with hostile supers, all dreads initiate self destruct. no actual threat to the dreads ever made it to system in time, but about 35 of them exploded. this actually happened yesterday.nyx tackled outside of a pos, by 70 bs and some hics. instantly initiated self destruct, theres no way short of lagging a system out right now to generate a super killmail as they all simply start the self destruct timer the second they get tackled, since they can no longer fend off tackle.there is no skill involved in anything i just described, and there is also no record of the ships demise. like i said, we don't really need the mail, but the loss should show at least on the pilot in questions combat record as a loss, and api verifiable loss, if its under fire at the time, the api will record the damage its sustained in its final minutes from other players and or the loss of the ship. in the case of the dreads that died, they would simply show themselves on their own mail."
"i agree with no insurance, but i disagree with the kill mail. i prefer that people be allowed to give km lovers the bird.destination skillqueue:- it's like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah, if you're small, fat and look helpless."
"stoffer gets it wrong again, no surprise.i've lost rorqual and carrier killmails and i've never successfully avoided lossmails by self-destructing (the one time i tried (in an orca) i lost my pod for my troubles.) self-destructs should not generate killmails. scuttling a ship is a time-honored military tradition and eve's version of it works just fine, tyvm.mag's has it right. no to insurance payout (this isn't iceland, after all, where people routinely blow up their cars for the insurance payout,) but no killmail either."
"i am fairly new to eve .. if it makes a difference to the devs or whatever, this topic is the first i have read on the forums that has inspired me to actually participate. i play this game with a small group of friends and that's how it will stay regardless of how impractical it may be in the game world . most of the game mechanics that punish the little guy make sense within the greater scope of eve and so, although they might make my life difficult they also make sense and create the challenges inherent to eve that make it fun to play.all that being said, fix the fvcking bounties!!the fact that this idea in particular creates a profitable pursuit for small corps and gangs, which the most ambitious and dedicated of your new players are going to be in, should make it an easy sell. on the flip every pirate dreams of being chased across the galaxy by bounty hunters. that's like a 'thing', which was obviously intended for eve but ended up being every grifter's wet dream. the system as it stands makes literally no sense. i can't think of any other game mechanic that makes entirely no sense to me, except this one. the one that i would most like to make some sort of workable sense doesn't. it makes more sense for me to just go gank. not the sort of elegance i have come to like so much from this game.no new skills are needed and screw the insurance problems (although of course they would pay the bounties and of course being a wanted criminal should affect your ability to get insurance, the fact that it doesn't is also completely illogical but i digress) this idea is ace. what's the effing point of tier 3 hunter-killers like what we got with the expansion if there is no game mechanic that allows players to profit from going hunting? what's the point of having criminals if you can't get paid to chase them? where's the bling? i have to be a slimy scam artist to be legend in eve? no epic criminals who escape capture for months, years? no good men with bad connections that can get the job done? fail, man.i get miners or griefing miners. or i go fight for the man in nullsec in some anonymous fleet. wow, epic. or, this basic spreadsheet payout scheme that makes the bounty office button in my station services into something that does something other than mock the reasons i started playing this game. how about that for a reason to fix the effin' bounties?"

"i propose that a new type of bomb be created whose sole purpose is to destabilize wormholes. the bombs would be fired just like existing bombs. they would have no effect on anything that is not a wormhole. they would either: remove a fixed amount of mass from the wormhole's max mass. remove a variable amount of mass from the wormhole's max mass. reduce the wormhole's mass by a percentage of it's current mass allowance (not the maximum). half-life decay.like all bombs, these would have enough volume to prohibit carrying too many (75m3). like all bombs, they would be slow loading (135-160 secs depending on the launcher).to make them challenging to deploy, the bombs could have a much smaller area of effect (perhaps only 1k instead of 15k). this would mean that you would have to be spot on with your accuracy, or risk wasting the bomb. to raise the bar on who can fire them, these bombs could require a bomb launcher ii (i.e. bomb deployment v, a 4x skill).to limit overproduction, the bill of materials could be balanced in a way to make them cost prohibitive for generic circumstances. blueprint originals may not be available, or may exist in very low numbers. other possible restrictions could be to confine their effectiveness only to the named side of the wormhole and say that it does nothing if fired at a k162. or, perhaps there could be 2 different kinds of bombs; one that only affects k162's, and another that only affect named sides, which means that you would have to stock both types.if implemented, i recognize that this proposal would greatly change the dynamic of w-space. i am dubious that this idea will get much traction at all, but i thought that it would have the best chance if it was introduced along with a buffet of ways to restrain it. i welcome your feedback."

"damn double posts, sorry."
"i think it won't matter what you do, only some players want to be actively engaged in this process and with such a low subscription count for such a huge world you inevitably have a low amount of people being actively engaged in politics. possible solutions: - rewards for voting. anyone who needs these rewards will most likely vote at random, people who do not need rewards and are not interested will still not bother. unless you can make a reasonable incentive to voting along with public, thread based votes in which people must give a reason and limit corp/alliance voting for their own members along with a way to nullify votes which are obviously only for a reward. understandably another council would need to be set up to overview the voting procedure and nullify votes which are deemed invalid by a set of rules. however this causes more complications, such as that council favoring certain candidates or taking bribes not to nullify votes for certain people. at any rate this is just another idea to add to the pile.- forced voting. this would not work in my opinion. people would just vote at random and it would create a breakdown of the political game as the people who actually care would not be taken seriously. in addition to the idea of negative votes the ability to impeach or remove csm members by majority vote would be good. i think in conjunction with the csm a judicial committee needs to be comprised of players to facilitate impeachment and/or dissolutions of the csm."

"many of the militias have been crying out for more meaning in holding sov, many rightfully feel that the whole war is nothing more than an arbitrary war dec. everyone wants consequence to ownership, so here's what i propose: 1) switch faction ownership of stations in systems that are lost to enemy factions. auga has, for example, a tribal liberation force station. should the amarr invade and seize auga via plexing, that station should be renamed \"24th imperial crusade occupied logistics support\" or something along those lines. the architecture of the station might, or might not be flipped in accordance to ccp's judgement on whether it would realistically be dismantled and replaced, or simply occupied by enemy troops.2) have enemy stations fire upon the opposing station, much like gcc. it currently makes no sense that i, a soldier in the tribal liberation force, can hang outside a station run by the 24th imperial crusade, and while the capsuleers will fire away, the station owners seemingly don't care. this creates a \"safe zone\" for owners of a system, and adds consequences to system loss. docking / undocking games are really lame, and this would quash station camps amongst the militias (which noobs and vets alike hate), and force the fighting back out into the plexes ccp designed for them, that are now spawning round the clock.all this requires is enabling a name change on stations, and a guns-on ai against enemy faction members. two simple programming fixes, much meaning and value to holding territory. some militia advocates the banning of enemy docking at stations, but this would unfairly punish the new players fw is designed to attract, who would be deeply frustrated if they didnt personally have the ability to haul out and move their stuff safely if it were locked out of a station. with station guns being the consequence, they could still undock and warp away with a z-mark if needed.thought? feedback? support for this proposal? i think this is a great \"bang for your buck\" fix that would have immediate ramifications and give militia members a reason to fight round the clock in defense of the systems they love."
"i support this changes and hans jagerblitzen faction warfare cause."
"thanks! i appreciate it. now admittedly, my timing of this is a bit late as they are on the way to the summit, but i wanted to throw it down here for the record if nothing else. if feedback is positive, maybe the next round of talks or the next csm can pick it up if it doesn't get brought up over the next few days. i also don't know if the strict two-week rule is still in effect regarding proposals. i hope its still useful to the csm or ccp dev's, either way!"
"i support these changes."
"hansi like it in general but in you don't explain what will happen to the agents. 1) the agents for tribal liberation force stay in the station in auga even though it is now a 24th station?? or would 2)they become inaccessible or 3) be replaced with agents for the 24th?i think 2 or 3 would be a bit too harsh.perhaps we could have a system where the station guns will fire on the enemy if 1)its your station and 2) you have sov. if the enemy gains sov in that system the station guns will no longer fire but it will remain your station. so the 24th station in huola would fire on minmatar if amarr keep sov. however if minmatar gains sov there is no station gun firing. also i have to say although i like the idea, its very minor/superficial and doesn't really address the substantive problems with fw plexing. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"i agree with all of your proposals, except for the docking rights. faction warfare needs something that separates it from the rest of eve. something that makes it unique. but, at the same time, low sec (specifically faction warfare) should also incorporate the aspects of eve as a whole.now, some people would say that not allowing people to dock in enemy stations is too much null sec. but, if docking rights shifted based on control of the system, imagine the dynamic that would add.low sec staging grounds could be lost. access to mission npcs could be lost. guns in your own systems could turn against you.that, to me, seems like it would increase the need to plex, offensively and defensively.and, since all militias have (if they don't, ccp needs to add them) an fw station or two in high sec, you can never completely lose access to missions. you just have a lot less options.but, since that would make only certain systems \"worth\" capturing, add in a \"border\" check. if you don't control an adjacent system, you can't capture the current system. if you lose control of all adjacent systems, timers in the \"cut off\" system are halved.congratulations. you have just made an active battlefield, with fronts, strategic approaches, placed hardships on your enemies by denying them their systems, and pushed a majority of fighting into plexes.gate guns, however, should never get involved in militia fights. that would give defenders an unfair advantage. gate camping is almost as bad as station camping.faction warfare becomes unique, pvp-oriented, mission-driven, and yet is still something the casual and hardcore alike can participate in. and, all you need is a t1 frigate to get started.couple that with my proposed changes to fw missioning and you've overhauled the entire system and made it something truly special.eh?edit: and make sure to give a two-week notice (minimum) before implementing the \"no docking in enemy stations\" rule. it gives people time to move their stuff. otherwise, they'll have to invade. or drop militia for a few days to get their trapped ships out. edit 2: this would probably require a new militia-specific channel for enemy activity alerts. notification of systems when someone triggers a plex button. something that people could close if they wanted to, was a permanent channel so they could get back into it, and probably shouldn't be allowed to talk in because it would get too spammy and people wouldn't notice alerts."
"this, to me, would be an acceptable solution to the agent issue that rightfully needs to be addressed. admittedly that was an oversight i should have considered in my initial proposal. ccp may have an even more elegant solution, but in general, station guns seem like an easy-to-implement and yet impactful change that could push a lot of fighting out into the field where it belongs.and yes, this is absolutely a superficial change. but at this point, ccp seems to be pursuing the fixes and updates in order of hours needed to complete them, meaning the easy stuff like this gets hit first and more sweeping overhauls get postponed till they can receive further attention. because of that prioritization, i'm trying to make sure as much of the \"low-hanging fruit\" is elevated to the csm level as quickly as possible, because i really believe that even a handful of small updates like this will mean a lot to the players and keep them around and fighting and most importantly (for ccp's sake), continuing their subscriptions."
"take back faction warfare!!!!!/signed"
"i agree, fw should be unique and separate from other forms of gameplay in eve, and that's precisely why such heavy handed solutions like \"no docking at enemy stations\" should be avoided, in my opinion. this is coming purely from my experience with corpmates that (despite all my warnings) have sold everything, rebought a personal fleet of ships out in nullsec, and lost sovereignty, only to limp home penniless without even a rifter to fly. losing access to all of your stuffs is a major morale killer, and one i fear new players won't be able to handle. despite the fact that the militias are currently comprised of high skill point pvp enthusiasts, faction warfare traditionally served, and should continue to serve, the newer players as well. frankly i'd much rather my recruits and friends focus on learning to fight, not learning to manage multiple hangars spread out to avoid a lockdown. newer players focus on industry or pvp, but not both, so those delving into fw at a young age likely lack the transport needed to move groups of ships around, and will fit and store ships one at a time most likely. even now, we face multiple front lines that are a half dozen systems apart, so even existing militia vets can find themselves without the right ship close enough by to make it when a mate hollers for help. i have concentrations of ships in at least 3 systems in lowsec, and still shuffle them around to fit the varying activity in different systems. adding a greater shuffle on top of this would even further cut into my pvp time, which is precious to me. i personally feel that faction warfare should be battle-focused, with a minimal emphasis placed on the logistical support that becomes crucial to living out in nullsec or wormhole spaced. i want mechanics that encourage more time fighting, not more time resupplying. removing docking rights and locking players out from their hard-earned gear would indeed add consequence to the warzone, but i'm afraid it would simply eat into time that could be spent out engaging in the almighty pew instead.this is just my personal take though, i'm certainly open to the consensus of the community should the majority disagree."
"*ack* another double post. ccp, lets get these errors taken care of!! forums kinda suck still."
"good idea, should be fairly easy to implement.side note (related): docking rights should never be removed in npc stations, but what of changing what can be done once inside .. increase service fees or even prohibit use of services entirely in enemy occupied space. alternative option is to add a 3-4x multiplier to redock timer in hostile space .. not sure if it is separate from aggression timer though and gate jumping should not be hindered, so might not be possible off hand. oh please, he only started championing fw recently while some us have been at it since the war was just a few months old .. just sayin'"
"i can only advocate for and organize feedback for the gameplay that i know, and i've been a militia pilot since i started playing the game 2 years ago. i completely respect the fact that there are others that have been fighting long before me, and yes, my real push for change has come in the last 6 months especially. i wouldn't have bothered before that, being a new enough player to not feel like i had an informed enough opinion to make a difference.the recent change in direction for ccp and the increased focus on \"flying in space\" improvements gives me hope that a window has finally opened up for us to make a serious bid to improve faction warfare, and i have no problem being a vocal, repetitive, outspoken supporter for the community and the game play feature that i love, regardless of my character age. i've seen a lot of scattered posts throughout the forums over the last couple of years that never gained much traction, so i'm trying to capitalize on ccp's recent willingness to be more receptive to player feedback and organize the feedback into something more digestible and manageable so we can finally see some real change. i really believe the plexing timer fix is just the tip of the iceberg, should we keep this up. i can't do it alone though, i'm only one man, i need everyone's expert advice, and hirana, yours is greatly appreciated."
"keep in mind that plexing as it currently works is pretty much a pve grind. so imo it is a good we are not required to plex at this point. also keep in mind there are very few roleplayers in fw. so if one side is winning and therefore gets large advantages pilots will just join that side. there are a few stations in high sec but very few. typically people do missions by gathering allot of them and then running them after they travel. i think completely shutting these down would be an advantage that would indeed make people choose to join the winning side. if they combined your idea with some mechanics that made it harder to capture more and more enemy systems (e.g., the losing side was allowed to bring larger ships into smaller plexes) i think we could have more dire consequences. but until then i think consequences that are clear but not huge are in order. hans proposal is really trying to walk that fine line of making things have some impact but not so much that every new player will just join the winning side. this is something that would truly improve fw plexing. it has been proposed for years. however there used to be allot of carebears like ank who did fw and they liked to run the plexes without any pvp so the idea didn't get too far. i think the latest proposal that incorporates this idea is in my signature. give it a like if you like it.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"not to sound petty, hans, but did you overlook the part where docking rights was tied to sovereignty? you don't lose access completely, only until you can retake the system (or leave fw temporarily, if you can't wait to get your ships back).plus, it would stimulate the \"faction\" economy by making militia lps more valuable. and it gives capturing and defending plexes a purpose. people would come out in droves to repel invaders if the caldari were taking plexes in heyd.also, if plex timers were dynamically linked to the number of people (with a limit) it would make small-gang warfare more common, or more the point. imagine if a plex took 60 minutes to capture solo, 30 minutes if you had 3 people, 15 minutes if you had 6 (within range of the button). those numbers are purely arbitrary. but, what they accomplish is not. now, one person has less of a chance to flip a system in a day, and having 60 people in one plex gives no more benefit than 6.faction warfare is teeming with possibilities that i don't even think ccp has even begun to scratch the surface.this is their opportunity to create a whole new type of pvp in the game that already has the greatest pvp of any mmo.i really wish they would grasp that fact and run with it."
"if this change were combined with my proposed change to fw missions, it would be of limited to little benefit for people to switch sides. also, some people love an underdog, challenge, good fight, being outnumbered, etc. so, you might have people switch to the losing side, as well.which is why we need ccp to give plexing a meaningful purpose, so that it is just as important to capture plexes as it is to defend them. when it has no purpose and no value, it will be done by only those that want to. no one felt the \"need\" to plex, so it became a pve grind.make them strategic objectives that impact the map in some way and every member of faction warfare will have a vested interest in participating. change the missions, too, and even the stealthbombing carebears will have to join in or lose some income.eve isn't supposed to be easy, and signing up to be at war with half of (the factions in) the universe damn sure should be harder than \"normal\" eve."
"by making it so every pilot counts we can spread out the blobs. if you capture plexes faster by blobbing up then this will be just like null sec. if pilots are better used by spreading them out then blobbing won't work. its clear you understand this when you say 60 piolots gives no more benefit than 6. however when you have 3 pilots able to capture plexes faster than one pilot then you will find that the larger side will just win. the side with fewer active pilots will not be able to spread out and capture plexes because their solo pilots and smaller fleets will take too long to capture plexes. the larger side will always have time to come with their numbers. i couldn't agree more. fw should be the place for \"frequent, quality, small scale pvp.\" ccp should focus on making that so. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"thanks hwong, but no, i wasn't overlooking the part about docking rights and sovereignty. i understand everyone's stuff would be intact until they regained system control. i'm just remembering back my early days, where it was simplest to manage by having a stack of ships in a common friendly militia \"home base\" (for us it was auga 3rd) that also had some market function, making it easy to be prepared for a fight at all times. if i had suddenly been locked out of all my ships, and i was still in the stages of learning how to make a decent isk income to replace them all, i would have been deeply frustrated by not being able to access my hard-earned ships.even if i knew i could get them back eventually, not having any ships to use in the meantime (which i'd need to help my friends regain sov) would have killed my interest in staying in faction warfare. i would have left, and not returned until i could afford to spread dozens of ships in every system as a precaution. having pilots leave and rejoin faction warfare constantly just to move ships seems like a waste of time and breaks immersion. everyone values their employment history, i don't see any advantage in encouraging corp-hopping simply to move ships.one of my deep appreciations for low sec pvp life is that my stuff is secure. i know that if i've earned it, i can pvp in it when i log on. that security is one of the primary reasons i've refrained from joining a null sec alliance, where if i have a busy month with out-of-game activities i might log on to have lost it all. having your items always accessible (even if you're being shot at on the way out the door) continues to be a huge draw for those of us who want \"casual\" pvp. i'd hate to see this go away, i just think there are other options (limiting station functions when docked is great) that don't disrupt a key advantage to living in low sec for the sake of adding an adrenaline boost when you're defending sovereignty."
"i have no idea what thread to post this in, but i just had another idea. purely cosmetic, but for plexes. (note: this should not be added in until plexing is changed to be a pvp-related objective.)medals! awards!specifically the following:conqueror: capturing plexes/conquering an enemy systemliberator: capturing plexes/liberating a friendly systemassault: destroying x ships in offensive plexesdefender: destroying x ships in defensive plexeswho doesn't love more bragging rights and chest beating?edit: and, hans, it makes absolutely no sense to me why a state protectorate station would allow gallente or minmatar to dock. that, specifically, is the problem i have with low sec docking rights.i ******* hate the fact that more than a few gallente pilots have carriers docked in caldari fw stations."
"yes there is some truth here some will change sides. but even when fw was pretty much meaningless and not hitting us in the wallet the caldari had many many more pilots than the gallente when they were rolling through systems. in eve more people tend to choose the path that gives them more isk.i am not sure your proposal would do much. yes it limits the fw lp to those who do pvp which is good. but you won't be able to make as much isk if you are on the losing side even if you do as much pvp as anyone on the winning side because you will not be able to collect as many missions per mission run.again i think you are right in part. however plexing is *mainly* a pve grind because there are allot of npcs in the plexs. this is why i don't bother doing plexes for the amarr. if they increase the consequences of plexing i still won't do them because i want to pvp.if i do not fit my ship for pve the rats will eat through my tank. then when an enemy or neutral comes to pvp i will either have to fight them with half my tank and npcs still hittting me/ or i will have to warp off. if they don't want it to be pve then they should stop making it pve. remove the npcs and give players notifications of plexes being entered. if they want to defend them then they know where to go. if they don't then they will lose it. either way it will be pure pvp. leaving plexes up to the npcs is why fw plexing is, and always has been mainly pve.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"just a reminder everyone, the assembly hall is designed for obtaining support for specific proposals, while your feedback is greatly appreciated, lets keep this thread focused on the original proposal and any general discussion about faction warfare to the main faction warfare discussion thread, or feel free to post your proposals for separate ideas in their own threads.thanks guys, the more we stay organized in our response, the easier it is for the dev's and csm to sort through and digest."
"i absolutely agree with you, it doesn't make sense that we would be allowed to dock at all. but there is lot of \"realistically, that would never happen\" arguments that have to be tempered in order to create manageable game play in a reasonable amount of time. again, i'm not at all shutting down your idea of denying docking rights, you're not the only one who feels strongly about this, i'm just explaining my own personal convictions regarding docking restrictions."
"i don't like the change on the broadcast history on fleet ui ; it take too much spacebefore it was like\"travel to xxx\"now it is :\"zzz request that the fleet travel to xxx\"take so much space for no useit's true telling us directly who sent the order is good. however we don't need nice sentences at all : the more words to read, the less easy it is to get the order quickly. and i have to rescale my fleet pannel cause this change take too much space on the x axis. and i don't have space here most of the time with the modules pannel... i was forced to change the entire ui to 90% to have enough place... that's ridiculous.so please do something like that :at the place at \"zzz request that the fleet travel to xxx\", just write \"zzz : travel to xxx\"it's simple, clear, and take no place. the only thing we need that we did not before is the name of the guy, no need for a ******* well written sentence.you imagine a marine giving a well said sentence to his guys on the battelfield ? seriously ?hell if you want to have a nice sentence at least put nice colors on the key words"
"ka-bump so ccp will find this and take my proposal into consideration."
"your gonna need to buy the guys over at ccp a couple more rounds before they take you seriously"
"fix'd================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i do kind of agree that training skills to increase the size of your corp is rather silly. the rest of the post is bunk though.personally i think training skills to increase your corp size is silly because anybody can be a leader. the guy that flunked out of high school can be just as good of or better a leader than the college graduate. this does not however mean that i think it should change. the current mechanic is silly...but fine.they are almost on the level of the old learning skills actually but not quite as dumb as \"learning how to learn\"."
"the reason for this is to prevent n00bs from starting corps without even knowing game mechanics. by forcing them to train it will force them to learn game mechanics before they come on the forums with tears of why is my corp no good ect ect."
"no!!! a well thought out idea though, but criminal scum already have enough things to grief with and brag about. if they want to steal millions or billions of isk worth of item or ships they can do it the hard way."
"i dislike the idea of theft. but building on your idea of cargo allowance in stations you could open a new medium for traders. for example, if all players receive a certain amount of cargo allowance (which can be increased/decreased with standings, skills, etc.) at each station you have to balance whether it's worth keeping all your items. allowing players to buy excess cargo allowance will serve as an isk sink and allow for players to trade these cargo allowances will create a new market. obviously cargo allowance has to be capped somewhere and a realistic price point will be extremely hard to determine as ships require tremendous amounts of room but do not necessarily sell on par with most items m^3 wise and, as such, could damage the ship building/trading market."
"the only way i would support this is if i can leave my hanger and vaults open to vacuum at all times and there was an automated clean up service to deal with the mess left after an attempt at theft."
"well maybe...... but still, it would be good to have some walking in stations. what if incarna was released and it was a success. its kind of like something else, you want it to be strong and big and then it's small limp and flaccid. with all the effort that went it, you just can't throw it all away. without the wod stealing development eve can get incarna and it will not be limp."
"incarna was released, and it was a dismal failure. the \"release\" didn't contain half as much content as wis was built up to have over the years it was being developed. all the effort that went into it worked against eve by letting it decay."
"bump for keep developing incarna but stop worrying so much about graphics."
"wtf is lox and deo2?poses use liquid ozone and heavy water.ozone is liquified ozone which is o3 and heavy water is 2h2owhere the hell do you get lox and deo2?? it's no wonder you can't make a profit running a pos, you have no ******* clue what to fuel it with currently.if you are fueling it with lox (liquid oxygen!!!) and deo2 (which doesn't exist), you are an idiot."

"get friends or uninstall eve. simple as. mmo's weren't made for singleplayer."
"i believe eve needs a judiciary committee (hereafter refereed to as \"the committee\") to help facilitate certain issues.issues the committee can address:piracy.scammers.csm dissatisfaction.how:piracy at the moment is quite rampant throughout eve, not that this is a bad thing but there are few, if any, serious anti-piracy corporations. none that i know of. the committee could act as a middleman for corporate/alliance wars, especially between \"anti-piracy\" and \"piracy\" corps. the committee should be given a budget, with which to place bounties on large scale piracy and null/wormhole sec corporations which subvert the empires. by placing a bounty on a corporation anti-piracy corps can have defined targets, with bounty being awarded based on the pirate players corporate rank. scammers are also a dime a dozen. i believe the committee should be allowed to punish serious scammers or corporate espionage, either through bounty as mentioned before or by flagging players as wanted. i'm uneasy as to whether being flagged would allow any pilot to attack them without security loss, only anti-pirate corporations or just as a flag for people who want to get even if you see them in low/nullsec. csm dissatisfaction and \"vote rigging\". and now to the main port of call for what i initially thought of the committee for. the committee should be able to impeach and dissolve csm's if player dissatisfaction becomes exceptionally high. they should also oversee the voting process and be able to nullify votes (such as an alt voting for the main, all of a corporation voting for their members [because they are forced or rewarded in some way]). this would need to have a strict set of rules laid out with which the committee can engage within. however, all things must eventually become decisions of the players in my opinion. a pass vote in the committee to impeach a certain member of the csm should not necessarily immediately impeach the csm member, rather open the vote to the whole community to remove them. again the vote process would be overseen by the committee to stop corporate and alliance voting within. this would force csm candidates to stick by their mandates.anyway, this is just an idea i've had and would welcome suggestions and feedback.and yes, i am a new player, however for everyone out there who keeps saying we need new player retention, this means we need new player involvement so i'm taking the first step to moving into a political career within eve.thankyou for your time,"
"cannot support in any shape or form.this would be open to massive abuse by the members of your \"committee\". the majority of this proposal seems to be aimed at closing off playing options that you don't like. i don't need a committee to help me deal with pirates, i shoot them. if others don't have the guts for that then it's their problem.scammers prey upon the inexperienced, stupid and greedy so while i don't like that (except i do like to see the greedy gouged) it is a valid way to play the game, a way that they pay their subs to play. as to your proposal that this committee would monitor the csm i find that pointless. the csm has no power beyond that which is given to it by ccp and the players that support it, treating it like an organ of government rather than what it is, an advisory body, seems excessive to say the least."
"i would also hope that this idea would give the csm more legitimacy and therefore more power."
"only if said committee can get people like the op banned...permanently.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"thanks for the constructive criticism there. no wonder you have no new player retention."
"it's very constructive.you want a committee? then i want the ability to have you banned permanently for any reason i choose.if you can't figure out why... you have no business posting here.think about it.why would i make a requirement like that?================ stop the evemail spam!"
"the problem is that new players who don't really understand how eve works post stupid ideas and then get upset when older and more experienced players tell them that it's a stupid idea. if you don't want to get called out on stupid ideas, don't post them. there are two ways to deal with the situation:1. toughen up. if you post stupid ideas, they will get torn down and laughed at. end of story. either accept that fact or ragequit.2. wait, learn how eve works and what is and isn't an intelligent idea, and then don't post stupid ideas.eve is not about people holding each others hands and being nice because you're a noob. eve has a system of consequences and rewards; if you do something stupid, you will pay for it. if that's not your cup of tea, there are plenty of other mmos out there that are much more willing to cater to people's feelings. you're more than welcome to play eve, but don't complain because a stupid idea of yours got torn down, c'est la vie."
"i understand that not all ideas are great, in fact most of them aren't. but there's no point shutting down all new ideas simply because they don't fit with what you define \"eve\" to be. eve is unique in the mmo world in that it is constantly evolving from player interaction, by simply dismissing all new ideas which don't fit \"your eve\" you marginalize this player interaction with the game. so don't just \"it's a bad idea because it is...\", rather say \"it's a bad idea because... it could be abused, we don't need further checks and balances in the csm, they're figurehead anyway... etc.\" by simply saying; you're new so your idea is bad you give new players no reason to keep trying.and regarding to the third paragraph, how does this idea not fit in line with that? by being a pirate corporation you engage in the risk of retaliation from a judicial branch. the reward however is that you can gain notoriety, bounty for all members to increase pvp activity and a more realistic empire response."
"i had thought this thing about the \"csm rigged voting\" was put to bed...it's like this: do you complain when a politician wins every time becuase he's from a very large city and that city always votes for him? yes, this doesn't always happen, but the point is people are going to vote for who they know. if the rest of eve doesn't vote at all, that's not anyone's problem but theirs. the csm represents the voting (and thus politically active) playerbase, not the whole playerbase. it was never meant to, because in order to do so they would have to make it so that you could not log in without voting for someone, and even then people would just vote randomly most of the time.and in terms of anti-piracy corps, they do exist. there are quite a few out there. they just don't form alliances because then pirates can see them coming (they all communicate with each other doncha know).i've been on quite a few anti-pirate roams, and we've actually had a lot of trouble keeping the bait and scouts mixed up so the pirates don't get wise. i've seen times when we've held the fleet 2 jumps out, jumped a single drake into a gate camp and the pirates all warped off before he even loaded grid.thirdly, griefing is not a problem in this game. it's legitimate game mechanics at work, and there are multiple ways around it. don't want to be war-deced? stay in an npc corp. don't want to be scammed? don't read local. don't want to be suicide ganked? don't fly where they do. it's actually quite simple. eve is about risk vs reward, and a lot of people keep forgetting that."
"i understand your point about the largest city idea. but it's not a very representative democracy. on to the third point, your solution for new players who get abused involves no risk, no reward and no socializing? that sounds like the most boring mmo i have ever heard of."
"piracy and scamming are completely in-game and no official committee should interfere. just make an anti-pirate corporation if you feel the need.csms last only one year. wait it out."
"piracy: working as intended.scamming: working as intended.csm: working as intended while conspiracy theorists complain and moan on forums.final tally - working as intended 3 : not working 0"
"if you want to ***** about piracy and scamming in-game.then i want the right to ban anyone in the game without restraint.your idea is just that...the ability to punish people without restraint.eve onlin is a world where scamming is a legiitmate business...so is piracey..theft..lying....and anything else in-between.if you can't handle it...then please be kind enough to \"get out\"like i said...you want to change the game to that degree? then i want you banned.why you ask?simple.... the same reason you want to punish pirates and scammers.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"the op's suggestion - while i cannot support it personally - is a trillion times better formed and more articulately executed than anything you could excrete out of that face anus (ingame) of yours that you call a mouth. he explains the rationale and some of the mechanics of his proposals, even recognising that he's not comfortable with some of the aspects contained therein. so, as a courtesy to all of the right-thinking members of this board, please do not again jump into a thread with a half-cocked line like: \"this proposal is crap hurrrr i'd tell you why hurr hurrr but i'm too leet for that\""
"thankyou for the feedback everyone, and to clarify i don't think the committee should be able to just interfere with any pirate or scammer. only huge scale corporations who actively pursue such nefarious means to hurt the player base. i've been killed in pvp before, lost the most expensive ship i owned and i couldn't afford to replace it at this point. i was tempted to quit eve, but you've gotta keep on fighting. so while i understand this is how you guys have played the game for the past eight years, i think the addition of an idea like this would increase legitimate and new-player pvp options by allowing serious anti-pirate corporations to be formed. if being able to interfere with scammers is something you all don't agree with that's easily fixed, just remove the paragraph.thanks everyone,"

"i have been thinking about this and i think the whole docking thing comes down to what ccp's original intent was with not letting them dock up.i think the original idea was to have supers and titans be this corp / alliance asset that no one person would be able to dock up for themselves and would sit in a pos someplace when it wasn't in use. then their enemies could come by and siege the pos and get at the phat lootz inside.but nowadays people just hide their supers using an alt. you get the super for your main and then train up or buy a super holder alt that can go in one of the 3 character slots on your cyno alt account. it has carrier 3 trained and nothing else. all they can do in the universe is climb into your super and logofski.now you can fly around on your main doing whatever you want, while your super holder alt (who is still firmly under your control) is offline keeping the super safe. then when you want to rock and roll you go to the safe spot you put your alt in, log it in, and switch ships.actually i think the super is safer logged off in space than it would be docked in a station. i've lost ships because of getting booted from an alliance while on vacation and i can't dock up and get them. also i think i have been too lazy once or twice to pull a hurricane out of a station that we lost in sov warfare.i think there are two solutions to this depending on how safe you want supers and titans to be.1. just say that supers and titans can't wink out of existence when you log off. that way you'll have to park them at a pos.or2. let them dock up.right now the super holder alt convention is more of an inconvenience than a game changer.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"said the tin supplier and foil maker.explain why the csm is better than all of the other methods for systematically gathering stakeholder input. why is it better to filter everything through a small group of people who are self-admittedly acting in their own best interest? is the purpose of the csm to provide feedback on the game? if so, who is gathering the input from the groups not represented by the current csm members? since the majority of players don't even vote, can it even be said that the csm is truly a representative body in the traditional sense? if we're going to pretend that its a democratic process, the process itself must first be decided on by the body politic, which is something that never occurred. if low participation is a sign that the majority of players feel the csm is a sham, then why do we still have a csm. the \"vote\" would seem to already be in and counted. why not formalize it? let's have a vote to decide whether there should even be a csm. or a vote to decide between a variety of methods to accomplish the same goals. finally, *adjusts tinfoil hat* what checks and balances prevent any csm member from from acting on nda information through indirect means? a smart, observant player with resources and an advanced understanding of the interrelationships of game mechanics could easily get his group to act in such a way that no one could ever say he violated the nda, yet they would still benefit from it. e.g. it is confidentially revealed moons will be reseeded throughout eve. so an alliance leader opts to not defend the space he currently controls and instead prepare to move to whatever new locations are eventually revealed. there's no way to prove he stopped defending it based on that information. i'm not saying its happened for sure, but the metagame extends into the csm process, so it seems safe to assume that it does. intelligent belligerents use every tool they can."
"disband the csm and with the money you save hire back 1 of the crying dudes that got fired. maybe have a blubbering competition where whoever produces the most actual tears in 10 minutes wins.seriously, this csm has been horrible and proven that the csm election mechanic is so broken that ccp would somehow incorporate it into new eden if it could only figure out how.failing that, support my proposal and let's at least have the opportunity to vote the worst of this bunch out."
"this isn't necessarilly better. and i don't think ccp intends it to be the only way to get input. i would say ccp have been very good about getting information from the forums about what players want. in fact i would bet there have been 5xs as many posts directly from devs as there have been posts from our csm representatives on the forums. most people at ccp are smart enough to know that the csm is not representative representative of the playerbase at large. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"let's hear them say say that, then. that would be a good first step."
"they pretty much have. don't get me wrong the csm is helpful to ccp. but its pretty clear that many people just voted for whoever their alliance leaders told them to vote for. there was no real close consideration of why they play eve and whether their alliance leaders ideas will make them play eve longer. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"you trolling, bro?if they 'pretty much have' then why the **** am i posting in the 'council of stellar management' section of forums?why am i not posting in the player feedback and suggestions section of forums?show me where hilmar has said 'yes, we're aware that having a goon spy lead developer (soundwave) a former goon leader security chief (darius johnson) and a goon spy/leader csm chair (alex) has a huge potential for favoritism and otherwise unacceptable behavior.'show me where hilmar has said 'yes, we're aware that csm v represented all of eve and we ignored them, so the best of them quit. we're also aware that csm vi mostly behaves like a bunch of juvenile delinquents and most of their 'ideas' are self-serving.'csm vi is like me without the foresight, ethics, eloquence, or intellect. perhaps that's why they get on so well with ccp."
"this is a pretty simple one, but one that i'm sure annoys the **** out of many people.say you have two equal stacks of trit in your cargohold that fill it to capacity. you right click in the cargo window, hit stack all, and the trit gets magically stacked into one neat pile. easy.now try to do this in almost any other location; pos corp hangar, cap-ship corp hangar, fuel bay, drone bay, etc. if there isn't enough free space left in the hangar to fit one of the stacks, you get an error message saying that there isn't enough space to move this item. you have to pull one stack out of the container entirely and then drop it on the other stack. why?fix plz"
"agreed...irritating bug, and not controversial to fix."
"plex is fine. let the socialists rule earth, not eve. nobody is forcing you to play the game for free. step up and pay for the game if you can<U+FFFD>t afford the isk to purchase a plex."
"i agree that plex should be account locked after one sale but instead of being able to only activate it for yourself you should also be able to activate it on another person aswell. i understand this creates another option for scamming by players \"selling plex activations\" but i doubt anyone would fall for this, especially considering what a plex is worth. this reduces plex liquidity, as any plex introduced to the market will only ever be there once. this means players will be forced to decide whether to buy them as they need them or stockpile them from the get go (creating a jump in the market)."
"any change to plex and i just won't buy them anymore. hope that is clear enough ccp, and csm"
"but other people still will, and ccp would like to remove the number of plex that are being traded, aur didn't really do a good job i'm guessing. if plex can seriously compete with isk buying then you're ensuring the profits go to the company who does all the good work, rather than to bot groups. to accomplish this either botting must be completely removed or plex must become more valuable than a bots time."
"seriously you guys want to fix an imanginary problem over 150 million isk. plex had been, until recenlty, hovering around 350 mil for over a year. plex is working as intended. there for leave it alone. market manipulation is a part of eve. welcome to a differnt kind of pvp that dooesn't require shooting space lazors."
"there is plenty of items to play market pvp with. plex is the only one which should remain clear from that for the reasons i've already mentioned in my previous posts."
"i'd like a straight answer from ccp just how much they've meddled in the plex market and in what direction.have they printed trillions of isk and bought up plex with it or not?all ccp meddling in the in-game economy needs to be fully disclosed."

"this a thousand times.eve isn't about honor points, it's about shooting rocks, building stuff, then shooting players. alternatively rats if you don't have the stomach for it (like me)."
"i like both ideas. while yes, velicita, you did just burn through their armor and structure hp the wreck isn't a single entity. it's a lot of smaller pieces of a ship. take a car, for example, if a truck hits you then your cars completely wrecked, but it's not like going up to it with a hammer and hitting it will do any more damage realistically. there is still salvageable parts if you do... the second one is a bit less realistic, considering mining lasers can pull in hundreds of m^3 per cycle, unless you also want to significantly reduce the salvage cycle time a single piece of salvage per cycle is not a good way to go about it either in my opinion. but removing the \"single winner\" outcome from salvage is a good idea."
"1. i think 10% to 20% of the unmodified hulls hitpoints would be better, it has after all had holes punched in it and been blown to hell.2. like this, makes salvaging a proper job."
"the perfect route design in this game is jita to hek/rens (hek for brevity, from here on out.) it's the route that most exemplifies a risk/reward design philosophy. yet, it's only one of two hub to hub routes in eve online that offers reward for risk as a travel option.this is a shame.travel between every pair of trade hubs should offer two distinct routes, with one route rewarding risk. the reward for that risk would be time.take jita to hek. the highsec, safe, reasonably risk-free route is 19 jumps. the riskier, much shorter, route through lowsec is 9 jumps. this is why rancer is such a popular spot for pirates. there should be popular locations for pirating. these locations should be along shorter hub to hub routes. i argue that there should be more of them.another route that is perfectly designed is amarr to rens. it is 20 highsec jumps, 11 jumps via lowsec. again, risk versus reward design. the reason why amamake is a popular pirate destination.shorter routes aren't going to get freighter pilots and carebears into lowsec. that is not the argument i am making here. those people are still going to take the longer routes. that's fine and okay. but there are a subset of people who will take the shorter routes, when they are available. they don't mind the risk of facing pirates, if simply to save some travel time. i'm arguing for the pirates, that they need more opportunity and more locations in which to ply their trade. there need to be a few more rancers and amamakes on the starmap.i'm making the argument for them, but i am not a pirate. i'm a freighter pilot. i'm also an impatient son of a *****. as a freighter pilot, longer routes would be a detriment to the hauling that i do. but i'm also damned impatient, and dislike long travel times, if i can avoid them. when i'm in the appropriate ship (frigate, covops, blockade runner) i do take the rancer pipe frequently when travelling between jita and hek. i've been killed in rancer, it still does not deter me.for other hub to hub travel, there needs to be an adjustment in the routes. for instance, jita to amarr needs more highsec systems between the two hubs. currently it is a 9 jump highsec route, but it should be a 16-19 jump route; it then needs a 7-9 jump route that passes through some lowsec. the same goes for jita to dodixie, currently a 15 jump highsec route versus a 12 jump route that passes through lowsec (the differential needs to be greater.) dodixie to hek is 9 highsec jumps, it needs a lowsec route that is 4 jumps. dodixie to amarr is 16 highsec, 14 lowsec; that lowsec route needs to be decreased to about 8 jumps.think of the pirates, man!-- from hub to hub travel: think of the pirates"
"this is a reasonable idea however i think the reward may not outweigh the risk unless you decrease the lowsec jump amount further, or increase the highsec jump amount. it would involve a lot of gate changing on ccp's part but it is without doubt something that should be looked into.edit: also an option for high sec only and low sec included routes should be there when you click set destination if it isn't already?"
"i want the \"time for plex\" option to be restored on the eve account management website. idk why this was disabled, but it sucks, plex are how i run my 3 accounts, and funds go short pretty often, so its usually every other 2 months that i have to let 2 of my accounts run out before i can afford to reactivate them. and i have made good use of this feature cause it made my life so much easier.so ccp, please bring this feature back. dont introduce convenience of this magnitude and then take it away 6 months after without telling us any reason.. plz ccp.players: like if you agree, and if you dont, please list your reason why.. thank you"
"this is \"hours for plex\" i believe you're talking about. they've temporarily disabled it because of the current gift items that they're making available to people. they don't want people to reactivate accounts they don't intend to plex, just to get the gift, trade it to a different account, and then expire again. at least that's their logic...of course there are plenty of ways to fix this, if they bothered. we too haven't been able to bring dead accounts back to life after the expansion because of this. they're really hurting their subscription base by making it hard to come back. the current working solution is that you have to file a petition and/or send an email from the email address registered to the account requesting it be temp reactivated. and then pray that you're at your computer for the 4hrs they reactivate it in."
"rumour has it that \"hours for plex\" was disabled for the duration of the \"core augmentation\" offer, to prevent people farming this implant. i would expect it to be back once the ca-2 redemption period has expired (but that hasn't started yet, so don't hold your breath).i won't \"like\" you just because you posted a poll. if you want to farm \"likes\" please post in the \"like and get likes\" thread."
"that worthless piece of +3 is worth the hassle?"
"eos is a pretty good close range pvp brawler good dps, tank and drone utility space it's bandwidth makes it a very poor pve choice thoughit could do with some tweaks just give it the 225m3 drone bay and another bonus instead say drone speed and tracking, it could get overpowered for it's role if you give it full drone bandwidth and might make the ishtar redundant if you give it the damage/hitpoint bonus.by the way it has 75mbit bandwidth at the moment and there is no frigate that can control five medium drones.main problem is that information warfare is rubbish."
"ah, a very interesting idea here. this would be a good fit to tie in with faction warfare plex revamping, since that is the principle they operate under - control fleet composition, and you give a chance for smaller ships to become much more significant."
"many <U+FFFD>fix lowsec<U+FFFD> proposals revolve around how to encourage more carebears into lowsec. i believe that's a mistake. the strong point of lowsec is the small gang, casual, pvp. and we need more pvpers to realize its potential.lowsec has many good points to attract the more casual pvper: it's very accessible. the combination of no bubbles and sentry guns discouraging small sps on gates make it easy to move around lowsec. with so many stations, it's easy to take a break pretty much anywhere.however, if you pvp for any amount of time in lowsec, you'll get cut out of ghsec. for the dedicated outlaw, that's not a problem: alts and corp-level logistics make it a non-issue. but it closes most of lowsec from the more casual, single account player. the one who would enjoy lowsec the most.so i suggest, <U+FFFD>what happens in lowsec stays in lowsec<U+FFFD>:lowsec sp and structure kills can't bring your sec status below -2 (the point where travel restrictions kick in). to compensate, make anyone with negative sec status a valid target wle in lowsec, with no gcc or sentry repercussions. sec losses from ghsec ganks remain untouched and so trigger travel restrictions. optionally, allow pod kills in lowsec to lower your sec past -2. ts lets people who want to be -10 for whatever reason become so. optionally, rework killrights to either remove them, or make them only usable in lowsec. people can now become part of a <U+FFFD>lowsec fight club<U+FFFD> where they can shoot each other freely, without losing their ghsec access.for the current lowsec residents, pirate and anti-pirate alike, ts would bring more fun targets from ghsec, in the form of <U+FFFD>weekend pirates<U+FFFD> and ghsec alliances trying to control lowsec systems and resources. both of those have given me many enjoyable fights, but both are unsustainable in the face of sec losses.i'm not sure i can tnk of a negative side to the change.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"not a bad idea, a lowered entry barrier and more incentives really are what low sec needs. you also might what to post ts in the features & ideas discussion forum though so it can be refined with more details."
"damn sir, that is a fine idea.i would like ts - there seems to be no upside to locking pirates into lowsec anyway. podkills and the like, aye that would make you unable to go into ghsec but sp kills... aggression and gcc to stay the same.i don't get why lowsec pvpers are the only ones who are penalised for wanting to shoot other people..."
"wow, i tnk ts is an awesome ideai like the idea of pods kills still make you go below -2.0, so if you want to be a real pirate and kill pods you can, but it makes alot of sense to make casual pvp possible"
"i agree too. especially since ccp are going through a phase of trimming out all the unnecessary time consuming fat, such as making pos logistics easier, surely it makes sense to make a change that eases logistics for lowsec pvpers? as jack says, it's sometng that's really not a problem for dedicated lowsec dwellers, just an unnecessary annoyance, and for the casual player it's a considerable barrier to entry."
"now when ccp made it the corp bookmarks. the bookmarks on overview would be nice.idea:two \"overview\" named folder to personal and corporation locations and when a bookmark copied there thats would appear on overview."
"you don't have to train every skill to level 5are you seriously considering training every racial capital including titans, to 5, all combat subcap ships, mining ships.add to that skills in market production, and research, and god knows how many category.just a hint, you don't need to. go for basics. if you have ridiculous amounts of personal isk to buy a titan you can buy a char as well.i can nearly perfect train a market alt in about a month, that is where the real isk is anyway."
"once upon a time my corp lived in nullsec and we had a ball with small-scale pvpthen i got my first set of +4s and got so freaked out about losing them that i froze in a bubble instead of burning for it, like id trained to do from my first step into gw. needless to say, i got podded and lost them all. it took that loss to show me how stupid id been about it all. im not in a terrible hurry for level 5 anything, so what difference does it make? since then, i havent plugged in a single implant, training times be damned. im a much happier pod-pilot now, btw, and pod kills mean little more than a nice quick ride home, haha. as to the ops suggestion, i like it. makes nice simple sense to me...oh, and i secretly think the guys in my corp get a little rise out of it when they hear on ts that their only verified female corp-mate is 'flying naked'"

"kinda want... not sure though."
"+ 1 suportthis this realy discorege ppl form pvp"
"not supported.losing the ship is one level of hurt, losing the imped clone should remain a second one. that argument \"it would remove a barrier to pvp\" fails when looking at the really expensive implant sets - the typical learning implants are just a pittance compared to the values a number of players (even pvpers) have in their skulls.\"don't fly what you can't afford to lose\" - you can extend that sentence to your implants as well."
"thanks for your contribution, faceless forum alt! \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"surprised to see this request coming from the goon camp. that said, i like this side of them \o/ . this is indeed a logical request. many times have i given up on a nights worth of pvp, as those 24 hours with sub-par implants in my throw away combat clone, just seem a waste of training time. is a perfectly reasonable suggestion. +5 base to all. everyone's a winner (in some cases there will be whiners, there always are)definitly an idea i think is worthy for more discussion & consideration."
"agreed on the point of not flying what you cant afford to losebut im afraid your argument on the 'expensive implants' part is a bit off... op is not advocating the removal of all implants, just the learning ones. the ones you assert are a mere 'pittance.' if there's an across-the-board means of compensating for their removal (the +5 stat boost talked about earlier), there where is the downside?adding more implants for operational buffs (combat, mining, exploration, etc) would be a nice addition to our favorite sandbox. wintheres always gonna be people that are afraid of pvp, for whatever reason. with this proposal we get rid of an outdated mechanic and some new shinies to try to avoid losing in pvpno flame intended, nor feeding of the trolls... the more i think about it, the more i like this, and just want to foster some genuine discussion"
"sweet troll thread. thanks for the laugh guys."
"agreed!"
"keep them. look, eve is about choices. with implants you have a lot, esp. since jump clones came about. first, +3 and +4 are pretty cheap. the older the player, the more true this is. second, you only ever use two of these implants at a time. if you remap focusing on two attributes, then you only need two implants. you can also mix and match. you can do a +5 and a +4 for near maximum training yet a risk worth taking. you can do a +4 and a +3 for a little boost over +3s.for crying out loud, don<U+FFFD>t fly in low/nullsec with a full set. when i was out there i just used two +3s, had spares, and kept them with my jump clone. it<U+FFFD>s not a big deal.we need to focus on the real issue: costs. the costs are fairly high for +5s. the costs for +3s is high for a new player. there is an easy fix for that. lower the costs of implants, release +6s and +7s at the current +5 price, and call it a day. this also doesn<U+FFFD>t address the +5% implants. the problem is the same there. it gives a direct boost at a high price that gives an incentive to stay in highsec. again, a person has the same options and the same problems.there is no way to make people happy short of giving them skills. people are not patient. all the time i see posts about increasing learning speed, getting back skill points, giving people unallocated skill points, letting people (through an obscure method) buy skill points. this whole thread is a <U+FFFD>we want to train faster<U+FFFD> thread. that is never going to change. attribute implants are just a scapegoat that people can focus on.since learning skills where removed attribute implants are the next target. this will either force everyone to train more slowly, give everyone maximum training speeds, or end up somewhere in the middle. the next target is attributes themselves, and people are already clamoring about removing those. after that, all people can ask for is faster training time. why? because they ran out of targets/scapegoats.highsec envy is no excuse. all the time i see complaints about highsec mission runners, incursion fleets, trading, etc. we used to see complaints about highsec mining until ganking became so common. those who live in highsec are always going to be more likely to use expensive gear, high priced ships, and *gasp* costly implants. that leads me to my next point<U+FFFD>add attribute boosters. make them easy and cheap to produce out in nullsec. heck, make them illegal in empire. sure some will smuggle them in, but at a nice profit level, increasing the rewards of nullsec. make them last 24hrs (boosted to 48 w/ skills). if you die while under the influence of these, who cares? they would lose their effect soon and need to be replaced anyway. you could change them more often than a remap too. heck, then use +2s with these and get a cheap boost.the justification is choiceswe should have a choice of how we train. there should be ways to increase and optimize that rate at an expense and risk. individuals should be in control of this tradeoff. those who deem the risk too high have made their choice; that choice should not affect anyone else<U+FFFD>s.other repercussions to considera secondary reason is that they are a good isk/lp sinks and serve as a <U+FFFD>highsec tax<U+FFFD> as it were. with 6 clones, 5 slots, and most of the population in highsec, it has to be a huge isk and lp sink. just removing it from the game when there are not enough isk/lp sinks is a bad idea."
"meh. i got podded the day before crucible and lost three +4s. it's entirely possible to simply choose to accept the risk of losing those implants. also, don't shove every implant in your head that will fit. only buy what you need.you might as well propose removing all expensive implants as well. faction sets cost a lot of isk and no one wants to risk those in nullsec, so let's just drop them from the game to save you from jumping clones."
"i'd say most people would be happy with the ability to pay plex to release skill points. most of us made a lot of mistakes early on and could free up anywhere from 1-3 million sp if there were a way to do so.it takes about 3.5 million sp to train a new racial battleship with t2 weapons (assuming you have the requisite support skills). that's frigate, cruiser, and battleship 4, and all of the weapon systems skill required for the large t2 skill at level 4. with +4 implants it takes two months to be able to change from one set of ships to another. for those of us who have been playing less than 2 years, that's a substantial percentage of our time in the game spent training skills we won't use. and then there are the l5 command skills necessary for t2/t3 ships.i'm expanding my command skills to other races right now and i admit, i'm getting impatient. it's going to take a long time for me to reap the rewards of training all these skills. meanwhile, sp i wasted in my noob days go unused. so yeah, i'd use up some plex to get sp back if it were available.i wouldn't want to be able to buy sp; that would be potentially game-breaking and definitely a step too close to pay-to-win."

"nah that's lamewhat would be cool is a special bomb that popped out on the other side of the wormholei mean it'd be stupid as hellbut cool"
"true, but there is an upper limit to the battleship (even with afterburners) option. if this bomb took away half of a wormhole's mass that could easily be billions of kg (an unfitted orca is 250 million kg). if it was a fixed or variable amount, it could conceivably replace several round trips with a single shot.the exact amount of mass 'damage' inflicted is still up in the air; i don't know what would be fair, but the harder these are to make and use, the more 'damage' they should do to the wh.you, know there's always the possibility to make another bomb that can extend the life of a wormhole, rejuvenating it's age and mass allowance."
"i have a serious question: why should there exist a mechanic to trivially close wh's? i really think there should be significant risk involved in closing a wh. sending through a large bs or hic at least has some risk, where it might get stuck on the wrong side, might get surprise attacked, etc. creating a sb bomb to close a wh from complete safety is just unacceptable!! imo, for most wh's, the game mechanics should highly encourage lots of bs or the use of capital ships to close a wh. it should not be something trivially done from the safety of a cloaking sb!!!!"
"this to be quite honest.course no whs spacer worth his salt wouldn't miss \"counting\" and \"calculating\" mass on a wh when it comes to these things.a \"bomb\" would take the risk....and the reward....away from such an hazardous environment as whs.the only bomb ill throw....is a shrapnel bomb. ================ stop the evemail spam!"
"wh dwellers already have wh crashing down to a science. 4 ships total with 1 jump and back for each and the wh is gone. this is the case with most wh's. introducing this mechanic would just make wh life that much easier and lazy. i am not entirely opposed to it though. i have always thought that a gun of some kind that could fire a super dense mass round into a wh would be cool to collapse them. it even makes logical sense that this kind of tech would be developed. it would just make wh life a bit too easy."
"100% do not support.you want to collapse the hole, push ships through it."
"i agree with the sentiment that ccp should not introduce a device that auto kills wormholes. what i am proposing is much more limited. remember, these devices would inflict any amount of mass 'damage' to the hole that ccp would deem appropriate. they could be hard to use, require specialized skills and equipment, take up a lot of cargo space and be expensive to build. they aren't system-wide smartbombs that eradicate all wormholes every time they cycle.correct me if i'm wrong, but i'm guessing that you would not object if there was a wh-bomb that only took away a single kg of mass from a wormhole and cost twenty million isk to buy. if you don't object to that, then we're not talking about a principle, we're negotiating a price.as it stands now, wh settlers know how to collapse their wormholes. from time to time miscalculations are made, but for the vast majority of cases, closing up a hole is done with simple math and good communication. it doesn't take long, and the risk isn't that severe. closing a wormhole is an inconvenience more than it is a risk in 95% of all cases.this is not just for carebearing. think about the offensive uses of these bombs. lure a large fleet into a wh and then rip it wide open so they can't all get back. maybe track a mining expedition going into a wh and close off their exit. come on, the idea of trapping people where they can't get out of has to appeal to some of you."
"no.remove local chat and make it harder to camp gates instead."

"no risk?i am a 1.5 year old pilot with 6.3 million sp. this is because i have gotten in and out of this game multiple times. but i keep coming back. now i need a way to get some isk and i would actually have some choices to move from hs missioning to some pvp and possibly see what lowsec or nullsec is all about. so i started thinking maybe i can run some incursions to get isk. but with my small wallet, and player and character skills i feel i cant really afford to lose the ships required to run hs incursions much less any low sec - null stuff. hell i probably wouldn't even be selected for any fleets with my t1 battle-cruiser with a little t2 tank anyway. there are some of us who are not set, and cant just buy everything we need and want. some players are just on the verge to be able to afford the activities that can actually make isk to keep this game fun.guess i'll go run a level iii for about 1 million isk for the 5th time today. ok, ok [/tears] here ....."

"does ccp? they never programmed in any consequences. they don't seem keen to do so. either because they don't share our vision of what is and what is not reasonable in the eve universe, or because they aren't keen to rewrite the code on these things.lets take a few examples from eve as it is:in npc hisec, when you shoot on a convoy belonging to the same corporation as the station owner, then the station guns do open fire on you for a period but then when the agression timer expires you can dock there without consqequence. in npc nullsec you can farm pirate spawns till you're blue in the face then go dock in that pirate's npc station without consequence. in pc nullsec the station owners can determine station access by setting their own standings. in pc nullsec there are no station guns. however, despite that, we can dream, so here i go.proposal 1: switch faction ownership of stations in systems that are lost to enemy factions.what consequences would this have other than cosmetic? in itself is has no consequences.hence,proposal 2: have enemy stations fire upon the opposing station, much like gcc - i take it that you mean to have them fire on the opposing militia capsuleers. otherwise it makes no sense to me.as others have pointed out, this in itself is not enough. i.e. what happens to the agents? can the opposing militia still dock?the best consequence would be station lock out and agents switching faction. this could obviously be diluted to reduction/increased cost of station services and locking down the agents.perhaps the station should be made vulnerable to conquering by the opposing militia when the occupancy switches? rather than just falling at the same time?hans jagerblitzen, you have done some stirling work in pushing the faction warfare cause forward. i just think you were a but hasty in putting forward this proposal as the lowest hanging fruit. so, although i think they are a good starting point for discussion. i also think that you are diluting your other thread be making this one."
"well traditionally, [proposal] threads have been pretty specific in scope, focus on one manageable, implementable change to the game at a time. they are less so the place for sweeping overhauls, complicated manifestos, and speculation about the places a system can go. i agree, this is really a drop in the bucket. but we still have more patches underway with incarna, and it appears ccp is indeed tackling things regarding faction warfare that are minimal on the programming end. a station tweak, with sentry guns firing on opposing factions, should be easy to deploy. thus, now is the time to throw it down on the table for approval from the community, because it could theoretically be implemented even before they move on to summer expansion.in case you all didn't notice, there are now more faction warfare systems as of the latest patch. the plex spawning timer fix is not where ccp's work on faction warfare is ending by any means. what those systems are, i have no idea. but they're there, in the patch notes, clear for anyone to see. it is in this spirit i put forth a simple proposal regarding sentry guns on militia-owned stations, though it by no means should be seen as a substitute for the \"big picture\" discussions in my other thread. it's just one piece of the overall puzzle, one that can be done now regardless of what else gets developed down the road."
"thinking about the fact that plexing is still a silly pve grind, i have to say, i would only want consequences like this to happen *after* they remove the npcs and let the militia players start fighting for occupancy. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"i'm dubious about this idea. the problem is that as cearain says, plexing is still really really boring. so what this would effectively do would be to force fw pilots to do an activity that they hate. at the moment enthusiasm in the amarr militia for plexing is at rock bottom, as demonstrated by the fact that the minmatar were able to capture huola with the vast majority of the amarr not doing anything about it. i've tried to encourage amarr pilots to go plexing in the past and it's really really difficult - very few care anymore. and i can't really blame them - i'm probably one of about ten amarr who still plexes and i have to say, if i had the choice between plexing every day and quitting fw, i'd probably quit fw. so while this would get people interested in plexing again in the short term, i think in the long term it would result on whichever side is winning just locking the other side's systems down. and once that's happened, are newbies really going to want to join a militia with the odds stacked against them?"
"since when did getting within 2km of a cloaked ship not decloak it? there is a counter, but hardcore carebears simply refuse to acknowledge this. there's plenty of things you can do to counter an afk cloaky. think outside the carebear box.the rest of your post is as equally pointless as that."
"you did actually. read your op again."
"uhm... you are aware that the \"current\" negative value of 0.0 was always there before right? they just didn't show it. that's why certain systems had consistantly better rats and belts in them. because they had a lower true-sec value. now they just have it all posted in game instead of having to check derived values on things like the ombey maps."
"it takes a ton of resourcefulness and dedication to set your igb homepage to wormnav/staticmapper/dotlan and check the data laid out in front of you?*waves*"
"considering that sleeper kills are at best a very unreliable proxy for wormhole activity, and that pvp kills are available anyway through the efforts that already have been made to compile combat logs, i support this given that wormhole jump data is meant to stay gone. it would make no sense to reintroduce jump data without the sleeper kill statistics, in my mind."
"i don't see why that couldn't be arranged. it would limit what you can store there, of course, but why not. the person hacking into a vault that has no atmosphere would have to bring along special gear to be able to move around in such a place.this idea is a big reach to begin with, and i don't expect it in the next patch, but conceptually, i still like it. the unease about theft revolves around risk and consequences. risk is all of the cybernetics and melted nanoribbons and little things that are worth millions. consequences is the thought that someone can start an alt, train them for theft and then transfer the loot to their main, and avoid the ramifications. i want to try and focus on those two ideas a little more.risk. obviously there have to be limits. someone who successfully hacks into cribba's station vault can't walk out with ninety bajillion tons of veldspar and a hanger full of ships in his back pocket; there should be a limit to the volume that can be taken in a single theft. a volume restriction is ineffective if the thief is trying to steal the valuable little things, which are much more valuable in every respect. how do you keep people from being robbed blind? here are some ideas. time restriction on a theft. once inside, you have a finite amount of time until station security responds. this could be as little as a few minutes, and a big vault will be hard to dig through to find the valuables. volume restriction. the thief came in through an airlock, and has to get his loot out in some way. it would be easy to say that he can only take things out that fit through the door he came through. other means (transport tubes, etc.) can come into play, and can restrict volume to a set value. tiered security. secure cargo containers could be a good place to store valuables inside of a vault. they could provide a second hackable barrier. theft insurance. if you lose stuff to theft, you get a payout. not sure how to prevent insurance fraud here.consequences. loss of gear. if you get caught by station security, your thief gear is confiscated. execution. if the vault defenses kill the thief, they have to get a new medical clone. loss of skill points. to prevent further crimes, station security erases pieces of your memory, removing the skills needed to steal (like t3 subsystem skill loss). sec status hit. perhaps you can even be blacklisted at a station for a period of time if you're caught there. maybe you can be branded a thief on show info and in space for a period of time? outlaw status?"

"stop posting. you're embarrassing us."
"that's the big point, going for near perfect graphics made the whole thing crash into a wall because the single player game was putting graphics cards to the limit. alot of effort went into that one room and ultra realistic characters that could have been spent on a realistic multiplayer environment (one which my cpu and many others could play in).a what if is, what if ccp pushed for economy instead of extreme graphics they might have had content that was full and able to be multiplayer on the massive scale that the game is. not a personal room but whole city inside a station. ccp can't change the past but they can change the future in the approach they go about it."
"the major flaw is that items aren't destroyable. its almost impossible to change it now. you would have to make it around 100x less expensive and \"manufactorable\" ingame and somehow reset the wallet from everyone (which is not feasible). \"blueprint copies\" only via aur but tradeable.the current system does not fit to eve. there is no reason to buy anything via aur. just buy it via isk and if you don't like it sell it again. it does not wear off and it can't be destroyed. this basically killed the already tiny demand, you see it at the collapsed isk prices - they all cost only a fraction of its original aur value.last but not least: no wod -> no wis"
"i don't know why you guys are trying to keep this thread afloat. no offense op, but the player base has spoken and most people don't want incarna."
"correction fis was on the back burner for 24 months, not 18!most of the work to start incarna has been completed, but the 80% incarna 20% fis has been switched to 20% incarna to 80% fis which i think is important.by putting less resources on an experimental technology it can focus on its implementation at less of a cost. results in less canceled projects and more production pushed out the door.i look forward to baby steps of incarna, but killing it is like building a house with out a roof and saying forget it i am done.i am looking forward to content like:--> localised markets - buying it off a preferred shop and a shop only selling to preferred customers. -->specialized items - modified ships that tweek a bs to be altering the sig radious for more shields (a 4 rig that can't be removed)-->player made adventures through bots:- though the use of book marks and corpes, alliances can make missions that improve their strength of hold over an area.--> hell even contract to kill some one.--> silly mini games and poker!!incarna has such a possibility to expand eves tool base for players to create a personalized portion of space.saying no to incarna is like saying no to tech 3 ships."
"bad comparison. tech 3 ships do have a use.as said elsewhere, this is eve. it is about flying in space. it's not an fps, nor is it star wars online or habbo hotel. development in cq and its surroundings should be treated as dogwash tasks, and there is much more to be done about fis."
"even 20% incarna is too much. ccp needs to cut their losses and abandon further development of it. we need more spaceship content in this spaceship game."
"i dont mind incarna development as long as it doesnt impede fis development, its just that simpleand no further roll-out of incarna should happen until the gpu-melting problem (op's rock wall, iirc) is solved to the point where someone on a celeron running xp can play it. my machine is a damn-sight better than that, i assure you, but it still runs a bit too warm. i want (and im pretty sure ccp does to) for everyone who clicks the cq button to enjoy incarna and walking around in stations without worrying about the stability of the machine they run it on. the rest of us will be outside, flying in spacewin win...sudden radical thought: maybe this is where the universe could use some sharding? wis and fis on two diff sets of servers? this way the jita node doesnt melt with the combined wis and fis load? meh, just a thought..."
"this. i certainly don't want wis to become a way to pass the time while avoiding pvp. if you want to be perfectly safe, sit in your docked ship and spin away. that should be the only 100% safe space if/when wis comes about."
"well...no...the most vocal have spoken and stated they don't want incarna. \"most\" of the playerbase would enjoy seeing incarna finished as would the large number of players that would join eve just to see it."
"the sims playerbase has moved into eve."
"from what i read, its not even the vocal people ho want no incarna, but a small subset of them. most would be happy to have incarna, if it ran well on the client side, and had a point to undocking.walking around in an avatar is not enough reason to have incarna, we need a cantina scene with things to actually do, but not things that would require us to partake if all we want to do is fly in space. think of the separation of the jump to lightspeed xpac on swg, where you never had to play on the planet once you got a space ship in order to experience the whole space experience."

"mining should give faction gains. you're like... mining for them."

"i guess someone didn't read the eula.you provide no compelling reason (other than \"i think these things are bad\") to create a body with the ability to punish players for performing actions that are within the terms of the game.in case you haven't noticed yet, eve is, at its core, a pvp game. whether it's on the markets, in nullsec, in wormholes, or in empire, the vast majority of play involves directly competing with other players. you have a lot of resources, but too much trust, you may find yourself giving all your stuff to someone who has no intentions of giving it back. an alliance with enough funds can significantly alter the prices of basic resources in the game by limiting access to harvesting them. entire regions of systems change hands over the course of months (limited by the terrible sov mechanics ). a vocal portion of the playerbase makes fun of players who only pursue activities that are essentially risk-less and require no competition with other players.surprisingly, the players who stay the longest, and are the most vocal about their love for eve, are the ones who participate in these activities that you suggest limiting. new players who get involved in these activities also tend to stick around, as opposed to those who just run missions over and over. punishing players who scam or pirate is telling us that we can't play how we like in our sand box. while we make fun of \"carebears,\" most of us pvp guys will not deny their right to enjoy the game in their own way, just lament that they find something monotonous and repetitive fun."
"first off let me say thankyou for a constructive response. i understand eve is a player versus player game and have no intention of trying to change that. and in no way am i trying to limit these activities, in fact, i believe my idea could even help to bolster membership in these areas. by placing bounty on whole corporations you invariably increase pvp activity against them, a true pirate corporation shouldn't be afraid of bureaucrats and i believe a more realistic system of government inside eve could only help an otherwise extremely in depth game."
"that's the thing, eve is a sandbox, you can already do that stuff. you can already say \"i'll give anyone who kills x 10m isk\", that is placing a bounty on someone. you don't need an artificial system to do so. if you want to form a government system, go ahead and do so. you will face the same struggles that all governments have, namely the opposition of anyone who doesn't want to give in to you, but there's nothing stopping you."
"a full blown player judiciary will just give another group of players the opportunity to do the sorts of things the csm does already.piracy and scamming are part of the game and csm's are voted in. all of their power lies with ccp.if ccp wanted to install a means to call a vote of no confidence, they would have but since that would make it more difficult for players in the csm to entertain themselves at other players expense...don't hold your breath is all i'm saying.part of ccp\"s core design for eve was to not only allow players to entertain themselves at the expense of other players but to encourage it.overall eve really is a good game but if people aren't lining up to play it, they aren't and ccp can either act like they care or not, it's their game and their business.ccp doesn't seem anywhere as interested in entertaining the masses and making excellent money and having a major pvp element in eve, also known as \"having it all\", as they are in entertaining those who entertain themselves at others expense.this basically means that ccp could be entertaining ccp at ccp's expense and the bill for that entertainment could be in the millions of isk.but it's their money..."
"i understand your viewpoint. you are still wrong, however.additionally: i tried to look up this word 'readnig' you used (i assumed it was a verb, could be mistaken), but i couldn't find anything."
"i think you misunderstand. i don't particularly want to form it, or even necessarily be a part of it. i think a system such of this could help to legitimize player judicial power in the universe. as eve is meant to be \"do whatever you want\", i'm sure people would enjoy sitting on a council like this, arguing over which corporation deserves a bounty, keeping the csm working hard for all players, dealing with gross negligence or misconduct of huge businesses. i understand and believe eve should be a pvp game where scamming is a legitimate option for making isk, but even if you give this judicial branch just enough power to set someones security rating to -1.0 for continued scamming you give all players the option of adding a bounty to a scammer. maybe my first idea was not perfect, and not many ideas are. heck i can't think of any perfect ideas. but i think some sort of system which introduces an additional risk vs reward system is never a bad thing."
"i'd like to counter-propose an oversight committee to punish players who commit the following crimes:ice mining.farming highsec l4s.bad posting."

"i like it!"
"i like it a lot, supporting. definitely needs to have the podkills for -10 to appease the \"tough guy\" roleplayers though.also i'd consider keeping sentry gun mechanics as is but just taking out sec ts below -1.99, ts way small sps would still be relatively safe to travel in even if you were -1.99-0 sec and part of the \"club\", and it would differentiate the -10 crowd as one more gameplay style (they can get more fights by being an appealing target due to no sentry aggro to their attacker, otoh they are stuck with sec travel restrictions)i'm sure the frigate crowd would still congregate to low sec belts et al much, much more than they do already. good fights for all. (an alternative to ts would be to finally bring concord bribery in to the game)"
"we could call it lowsec arena."
"seems like a good idea. most of lowsec is guys wanting to kill each other without having to deal with 0.0 stuff. current game mechanics are notng but an annoying obstacle to that."
"could do ts, but on the other hand, sentry guns have a huge effect on fights with 2-10 people per side, wch are the kind that should be encouraged in low. if you leave sentries in place for the majority of the casual pvp population, they will cause lots of mexican standoffs on gates and stations.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"ts is true and wle it won't make sentries less influential during fights, reducing gcc to 5 minutes rather than 15 might encourage more 'weekend pirates' to risk sentry fire over combat.and if not, us lifetime pirates can show up to these standoffs and mess with both sides"
"good plosophy. true carebears are going to avoid lowsec anyway, so why bother trying to prod them?"
"ts is sometng i want.the security penalty is the reason i don't pvp in low sec."
"pirate agents in lowsec would be nice though.edit we were ganked 3 times wle posting ts message."

"huzzah!"
"i like it! ts idea definitely has my support. it becomes annoying and too much trouble trying to fix your sec every time you get below -2 for gh-sec travel abilities or keep it above -5 to remove kos rights. also what the hell is the idea w/a 15 min gcc timer or 10 min (standard) cynosural field timer. >.< strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat!"

"i respectfully disagree. two implants in particular would be very effective: perception and intelligence. i think ccp would agree with me as they are giving those implants out for free. while +3s may be too costly for a new player, +2s and +1s are not. a new player typically is not expected to have access to the entire game. that said, i suggested making current plants cheaper. cost is the real issue.as for the op bullets:point 1 response: cost is the real issue, thus lower them.point 2 response: see attribute boosters (illegal in highsec) above.point 3 response: we need the isk/lp sink while attribute boosters would have nothing to do with lp.point 4 response: boosters could take them to +5 levels. i see nothing wrong with +5/6/7 pirate implants.as for the summary, not to be condescending, but it only makes sense in the \"we all want to train faster\" or the \"we want something for nothing\" sense. i would like to see the reverse happen: more attribute augmenters added, and the potential for future attribute boosts (mutators, black cyber implants, or jovian gene manipulation anyone?).a short history of +5 implantsat one point +5s were out of the question, worth a billion isk each. most had +3s or +2s; a few had +4s, but those were costly too. since the lp store came into existence, the cost of +5s came down. then the price point was in line with highsec availability, especially for mission runners who get them at a discount (and oh the angst against mission runners). now we have a <U+FFFD>haves and havenots<U+FFFD> case whereas before the perception was that almost no one had them.attribute boosters (cont.)nullsec <U+FFFD>havenots<U+FFFD> have the strongest argument, having risk but not ready access to implants (lowsec, you have l5 agents). i can relate; i had a hard time getting my +3s and spares out there. attribute boosters would reverse the situation, making the <U+FFFD>havenots<U+FFFD> the <U+FFFD>haves.<U+FFFD> implemented correctly, this addresses the problem of cost and availability. this also adds content to the game, an incentive to go to nullsec, and rewards the risk of nullsec (esp. if the boosters were +2/4/6 in power).again, not to be condescending, but the op flattens the game.pushing the envelopei would like to see new elements of the game that increase learning rates. this has happened before. the second set of learning skills were warmly received initially. lower implant prices put +5s in the hands of many happy players. remaps thrilled those with poor attributes and good attributes alike. giving away learning skill attributes and giving back skill points was met with huge support. while removing learning implants seems like the next step, i see it as a cap on learning speeds, not a boost. faster training will make all players happy, but i think this is more about costs and <U+FFFD>haves and havenots<U+FFFD> more than anything else. attribute boosters, mutators, better learning implants, and other ways to increase learning speeds periodically released are what i want to see added to the game."
"as if learning implant would ever be removed... it's simple: if i fear losing the implants because i may get podded, i wouldn't undock, thus making no money. it's the same as with ships: if you don't want to risk it, why have it at all? but that's a personal choice everyone has to make for himself."
"i mean compensation to those have them in hanger----you cannot just make their property vanish.boosters will also be 'bad' if they become a 'must' instead of 'optional'. that is to say, without side effect and everyone should use."
"dear gods, the goons do have a swarm mentality o.o so far i havnt seen ne post made by you guys/with your participation that hasnt been flooded with repsonses from both test and goonwaffe and there affiliates!back on topic though:i think implants are fine to be honest. if you dont want to foot the bill and the loss of the implants should you get podded, then its like saying ban pirate/faction modules and ammo! yet they ae used in pvp were the risk of getting blown up is high depending on what is being done at the time."
"lulz@ goon entitlements. must be able to get podded at no cost. i want the good stuff, but not consequences.nothing is \"must.\" no one is preventing you from undocking because you don't have implants in your head. don't plug in what you can't afford to lose."
"get rid of them, same with remaps.i remember when i was a noob training all the core weapon and ship skills, i calculated i lost like 1-2 months of training a year into the game because i wasn't mapped for perc/will (fell into the charisma blackhole). i never really pvp'd in nullsec cause fear of losing my learning implants too. eventually i got a jump clone, but it wasn't really used for travel like the skill is intended. i just used it when important fleet ops came up so i wouldn't lose my learning implants. if players are not min/maxed for training,especially noobs, they are just hurting themselves in the long run. lots of potential sp down the drain. just like the learning skills.isk can be lost and replaced, but lost training time cannot be replaced. this prevents many people like myself who didn't want to pvp because you could lose training time."

"the proposal is as thread title.surely only proposals should come from those members of the community whose words have been peer-judged to be awesome. this would have the pleasantly double-edged effect of i) only allowing aforesaid awesome posters in suggesting only the best ideas and ii) giving those deemed not worthy by the like system scope to buck up their ideas, pull themselves together and become more like the cool kids.in the interests of paternalistic concern, however, under this system everyone would still be able to vote on the threads of their choice, as present.what do you say? show your support!"
"i completely agree, but let's set the goal a little higher so only the cream of the crop actually can participate. i think it should be set at a minimum of 10,000 likes. that should keep the riff raff out.7/10"
"for this to happen the feature and ideas discussion forum would need to be more trafficed. a lot of the threads posted here really belong over in fid. the assembly hall tends to get flooded with unrefined ideas that people just whip up and get excited about (i am guilty of this myself). 1000 seems really high though, maybe if it was something like 200 i would support this proposal."
"the very fact that you posted this idea here proves that having a 1000 likes does not make you a better poster."
"wrong. having 1000+ likes makes you one of the best poasters. besides, look at the other threads in this depressing sub-forum: can you honestly say that even a left-field idea such as this doesn't at least integrate with the new social network paradigm that ccp introduced here (and wouldn't it go well with the very idea of the like system? after all, what the hell else was it introduced for, if not for something like this?)."
"i was thinking of something like that but discarded the idea when i considered that number to be way too outlandish. if that idea were to be introduced, only lyris would be able to create new proposals (lol!)acquiring at least a thousand likes is a difficult, though by all means not impossible, task for the average capsuleer to achieve. it provides a goodly dose of motivation! :)"
"i could be persuaded to round the number down a bit, depending on the general consensus. thanks for your idea, +1 to you."
"oh, before i forget, even if he had a million likes (lol!) drake draconis and his would forever be forbidden to make proposals. i'm just shooing that proposal onto this one. :)"

"given the slope of the eve learning curve, first time offenders of certain questionable yet not out-rightly aggressive acts in hi sec should be shown some leniency. as an example, the use of a 'cetus' ecm shockwave i currently causes instant destruction by concord. for a first time user of this device, which can easily be mistaken as a purely defensive device, this is an obvious shock. the loss of one's ship, fit, and cargo is annoying enough, the loss of significant security status however is unwarranted. this is a clear over-reaction on the part of concord.for the more sadistic eve players who prefer to respond to proposals like these with the usual derision - you might want to pause and realize that the more care-bear fodder floating around in the game, the more your piratical activities will net...the burst ecm may be a special case and thus easy to patch, however i want to encourage an attitude shift on the part of concord (and perhaps eve devs?) in general. a 15-20 second warning for players who have not repeatedly committed the same type of aggression would be a respectable yet decisive way to handle unintended hi sec aggression.there are a number of ways to implement with this issue but i propose that a field be added in each potentially aggressive device type per player that records the number of transgressions with the use of this type of device so that concord can react based on a player's history. the degree of reaction can then be gauged appropriately."
"does the burst ecm feature a warning?"
"scuse' me?this has to be the most utterly hillarious request i've seen yet.first time offenders by concord are quite funny and very light in comparsion to what you elude or imlpy.my first time was more of an accident but i was warned prior to said action.your full of crap good sir...kindly take it to the bio room where it belongs.not supported.*walks away laughing*================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i received no warning of any kind - activated the device and the ship was gone. no aggression popups have been disabled. this is not a gratuitous proposal."
"well it'll be gratuitous when we can get one free gank per 10 hour hero"
"iirc, any module where you get concordokken will show a warning ... now, if you disabled them already (because you were trying to gank a miner, say) ... that's your own damn fault."
"there's a good idea."
"actually, i feel that there's something of merit to this idea. as has been stated, the job these bug testers do somewhat resembles the job that actual qa testers do, who are employed by the software company directly. the only difference in this case, is that those taking part in the mass sisi tests are i) not employed by ccp and ii) don't really get anything worthwhile out of the experience (ok, they get a load of singularity sps - yippee - and perhaps they log on with their mates and have a laugh).as far as i can see, these testers are performing a task which ccp (or any other company) would ordinarily pay for. the least that ccp could do would be to give these people something small but tangible as a reward - hence why 10k (or thereabouts) sp wouldn't be such a big deal. not gamebreaking really, when you think about it."
"maybe you should \"think\" about it a little more before you open that mouth of yours.the last thing we need is a bunch of people logging into sisi with the single motivation to gain more sp's and give ccp poor quality test results to waste their time and delay the repirations of the game.as its been said before repeatedly.... if you had bothered to read and pay attention....grant aurumn or vanity items... but sp's are not to be considered an award unless restricted to sisi itself.anything that gives an unfair advantage is a bad idea....especailly if that award wastes ccp's time in trying to get this game up and running smoothly enough for everyone else.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i read the ideas about vanity items. i thought your idea, handing out maps and whatever else, was silly, but the one about aurum is ok. besides, other people have already mentioned the data-quality issue, and proposed counters to that.at the moment, there is not much to entice people to these tests."
"this"
"no.for the simple reason that closing wormholes involves having ships out in space which can be attacked. if you replace this with \"wh bombahs\" it will reduce the amount of conflict in w-space which would suck.so like the other guys said. push ships through until it closes plx."
"has anyone had a fight with people actively trying to close a wormhole, or been attacked while trying to close one?"
"yes, to both.so why would people use them instead of pushing ships through?your proposal removes all risk, both from being stranded and from being attacked, from collapsing."

"learn to scan, then go run gas proc/hpas until you have a few nanite controls. plexing in low sec is pretty much risk free as it is, as long as you don't blindly jump through gates and use directional.you also need less isk / sp to begin exploration than you do to start incursions, hell you could even run c2s.the problem with incursions at the moment is that, as the above poster shows, new players see them as the only viable way of making isk. they shouldn't be, it complete destroys the scope of this game."

"infomorph physiology5% reduction per level in the time required between jump clone activationsprimary attribute: intelligencesecondary attribute: memorytraining time multiplier: x4level: 1prereq: science lvl 5, biology lvl 1, infomorpgh psychology lvl 1as previously posted here"
"i support this idea"
"requirements should be considerably higher, like \"infomorph psychology iv\" and maybe \"biology iv\".we're talking about a skill relating to its base skill like \"advanced weapon upgrades\" relate to \"weapon upgrades\".and with the possibility to shave off six hours from jump clone cooldown the training time multiplier should be at least x6."
"i don't think a 5% reduction is high enough, at lvl 5 you would still have to wait 18h, and since most people would only train it to lvl 4 it would be 19h 12m for them.a 10 or 15% reduction would probably be better and make it a useful skill."
"finally something here worth responding to.yes!"
"not a horrible idea, better than what we have now, but not as good as my idea to eliminate (or dramatically reduce) timer for same-station clone swaps."
"this is a fantastic idea. supported."
"trading itself is a isk making profession. amoung the highest. would order number be limitless?this would end the need of having alts, or training them."
"touche'."
"not supported. mostly because you can simply target people who are known to be offline at a given time and thus defenseless. even poses and similar structures have some means to enforce a confrontation with the defenders.make something dependent on skills works only for so long until players regularly train to level v. then it is \"either it works or it doesn't\" without anything in-between."
"i was imagining something that you being online or offline would have no bearing on a theft. imagine it more like tower defense if that helps. you have a station vault, you upgrade the locks on the doors, you buy and place defense guns, detection grids, sentry robots, traps, put valuables in locked station containers. you're off in space, in a mission or logged off when someone hacks your vault, it would make no difference. it is the plans and traps you set up versus the person. unless you are in your vault when they hack in, i don't see how you could be directly involved. at least that was how i saw it."

"but now you don't have to go turn on your defense mods, just leave them running all the time!.alternatively, if you're using that little cpu or pg, down-grade to the next smaller size of tower. if you're hardly making a dent in the pg and cpu of a small tower, you need to use your towers for more. of course, the vast majority of players aren't complaining because their towers are profitable enough that even if they weren't fully utilizing the pg and gpu of the tower, they can afford full usage. maybe you should look into making your operation more profitable first, instead of whining to ccp about a change that was announced well in advance of the actual implementation."
"i fixed your post."
"not always ... i've got one that's not \"profitable\" with the changes (it might break even) ... but even with the cost being less than profitable, researching bpos with no wait (and thus, being able to bring things to market faster) will continue to prove profitable.and the corpies like it too. works for me."
"from the numbers i've seen scrapyard bob throwing around.in general, the blocks make towers cheaper to run, even if you weren't using all the cpu and pg. large towers are potentially a different story."

"lol 0.0 is mostly what ccp worked on since eve opened...move along...but here's a cookie"
"the fact that it has been \"ignored\" is probably a good indication that it is not nearly as terribad as you want to make it out to be. prioritization of resources and all.i am not sure what exactly you mean by lolcamps nor the difference between lolcamps and any other type of camps found in other areas. since you seem think it matters significantly, it would be helpful to clarify exactly what qualifications divide \"players shooting other players\" from pvp. i am sure that given a sufficiently myopic view you are right... i just dont know how tight i need to pull the blinders in order to see it.just in case you are insinuating that its all fluff numbers from smarty camps, structure shooting, and hauler kills i would suggest that you actually read the entirity of the thread."
"there is no good reason for low sec going ignored for so long, that's the purpose of this thread and many other threads that have been asking for some well deserved dev attention. 0.0 has all it needs for the moment with regards to game mechanics. there is plenty to be gained by leaving high sec and going to null. lots of incentives exists for making money, pvp, pve, holding territory, ect. the reason people whine about 0.0 and why people don't want to go there is because what players have turned it into. people aren't willing to be worker bees or cannon fodder for big alliances that care little for them.low sec on the other hand, has no rewards proportional to the risks for people living there. people go to low sec to get kills against and get killed by pirates. other than that, there's nothing unique about low sec that you can't easily do in high or null."
"so lets see....people can enjoy shoot-everything pvp without the hassles of 0.0 (ease of logistics,no bubbles, sentry guns making fast lock frigates difficult to use... these were things brought up earlier) and without the hassles of territory holding (cta's, necessity of huge blobs, etc... your gripes).but....there is nothing unique about lowsec.now i would love it if i could have all the isk printing of 0.0 with none of the hassle. just because i would like it doesnt mean it is a good idea though. more importantly, a discussion of rewards in lowsec have nothing to do with the op.anyway, back on topic.op should change the words \"barrier to entry\" to \"barrier to exit\". technically there is very little barrier to entry, something he himself notes.second, op has left out some of the consequences of allowing anyone who is -0.01 to be shot at with no gate aggression. this will decrease the amount of time highsec corps and \"weekend warrior\" type players spend in lowsec.not that i think the op really cares about that in the first place... but maybe i am just being cynical"
"out of the myriad of \"fix low sec\" topics i've seen the past year, this is one of the few i actually like. you recognize the appeal of low sec and this idea should improve on what we already have there. i fully support it."
"i thought of something similar just last night.+1"
"if you want to get pedantic, it would be something of a \"barrier to staying\". without alts, or the means/time to recover sec quickly, lowsec pvp becomes unsustainable in a short time.because some people won't fight if they don't have npcs on their side? maybe, but those wouldn't gcc at all, and so wouldn't lose sec. but many would, more than now, and so the pure anti-pirate would have more targets available. win/win. so, what's my hidden agenda, then?what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"+1over"
"there are too many people who stay above -5 just so that frigates cant tackle them on gates. by allowing anyone who is negative to be aggressed without sentry retaliation you have fixed this grevious exploit. kudos! even better is that you give a chance for noobs to play in lowsec gangs too. having barely skilled noobs is fine if 2-3 of them can pin down ships on gates long enough for our tornados to lock from outside point range. targets go boom, noobs get to contribute, and we stay safely out of point range.+1 to this idea and anyother idea that lets frigs and t1 cruisers aggress on gates."
"false.anti-pirates. srs?mimiru has basically pointed to the reason why highsec dwellers will have to spend more time in highsec. they will have to keep thier sec rating positive.i was giving you the benefit of the doubt. i see i was wrong now."
"explain how. if it involves corp logistics (the only option i left out), that's basically the corp leadership's alts.nrds roleplayers, fw from opposite sides teaming up to fight flashies, industrial alliances thinking they are hardcore, or just opportunistic pvpers who only shoot flashies. they are everywhere.no, they won't \"have to\". they may choose to do so, if they feel they need sentry protection. there's two ways this can go.either there are so many new yellows that there are frigs on most gates. then yes, there's a strong incentive to be part of the positive sec minority, since travel for you will be very safe. but on the other hand, you do have the option to engage those yellows whenever you want, so you won't lack pvp.or there is enough of a mix of yellows/non yellows that camps still need to tank sentries. in which case, lowsec trave for the yellows is no more dangerous than it is today for outlaws. and it's not all that dangerous.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"are you kidd.......... ooooh i see. you got me.8/10."
"when i was a carebear, we tried lowsec mining for a while. it wasn't any more profitable than highsec mining, carried a lot more risk, and logistics were a nightmare. still, we went at it for about two months, and here are some thoughts based on that:1) lowsec needs more rare ore. it's currently just not profitable enough to mine lowsec versus highsec. move all the \"medium\" ores (everything but abc and the three most common) to lowsec belts exclusively--grav sites can stay the way they are--to push more mining there. and of course, lots of people have suggested ice be moved entirely from high to low.2) get rid of the inefficient refineries in lowsec stations. we lost a lot of minerals when we finally gave up trying to import ore into highsec for refining and did it out there. there's no point in those penalties and they're just a hindrance to industrial efforts.3) make it easier to set up and maintain a pos in lowsec. the empires can't be bothered to patrol out there, yet they can magically prevent you from setting up a pos without the proper standings and licenses?"

"new players can get the cerebral accelerator (box editions are still out there). they also start with all the points from the old learning skills, a standard well balanced set of attributes, and the tutorials give away skills and even ships (at least tier one industrials). cybernetics 1 gives you access to most of the learning implants. the prices on +1/2/3s have come way down over the years. oh, plus two remaps.honestly, i think new players have it pretty good.mistakes will be made. this is not because of attributes, but because a player is new.if you can't afford to lose two implants, i don't know how you can afford to lose a ship or replace a clone. why no one here is using +2s or +3s is beyond me. if there isn't enough profit in nullsec, that is the real issue. btw, not everyone in highsec has a full set of +5s. some are smart and just use two at a time. some just go for a +5 and a +4. still others don't see the benefit of an extra few hours a month and stick with +3s. it is a choice everyone has to make.i also keep hearing about barriers between fun, but i disagree. you can throttle attributes to train faster, balance them to perception and intelligence to give the best overall training times, or balance them out for all around decent training. it lets you choose what you want to train faster, lowering the barrier of fun. granted, you have to know about skills, the game, and how to play it well. that goes for fittings, tanking, damage, trading, and anything else in eve. if remaps were removed, chances are we would end up training at a slower, more general speed, hurting players top training speed. the barrier to fun would be increased. if implants were less costly, booster were introduced, and new implants were released, then the barrier to fun would be reduced."

"you're right, it is, theres also all manner of things that happen to chronicle the event, in fact, i'd say about 99% of all scuttled ships are recorded, usually by the foe of said ship, who watches it go under.like a killmail, only its kept in the military history books."
"but how does being witness to a scuttling translate into being privy to all data concerning the ship immediately prior to the act? hell, they are still finding known scuttled wrecks from wwii with all sorts of gizmos and treasures that the observers were completely oblivious to.- remove insurance.- generate mail for self-destructee.- remove pop-up notification of sd initiation.alternatively/additionally:- low chance of getting a copy of mail when salvaging wreck.- person must be de-aggressed to initiate sd.the mass-sd of dreads you complain about is only tangentially related, has a lot more to do with the way the address book system works. solution: five minute delay before \"the others\" (ie. not alliancee/corp) get online notification for entries in address book.hardly a coincidence that this complaint suddenly gets so much attention by eve's premi<U+FFFD>re e-peen whores after the log-off evasion has been removed .. well guess what; log-offski abused a system designed to protect against power outages and whatnot (ie. oog events) whereas sd uses system that is not only part of game but requires people to remain in game and that they take a quantifiable economic hit.ps: mass log-on of capitals that you describe should be deemed an exploit as it is for all intents and purposes a log-on trap .. only difference is that it is done with capitals since they don't have to be anywhere near the actual gank the \"tactic\" is condoned."

"can the csm request that ccp update the players on the future of incarna?there is degree of uncertainty about incarna<U+FFFD>s future given conflicting statements by ccp. there is a lot of speculation and belittling of players that express an interest in incarna, which is not helpful. hilmar said in his letter to the players that incarna was an essential part of the future of eve, then in a later interview said that <U+FFFD>incarna was on ice, and that we may get back to it<U+FFFD>.this has created confusion.it is also important to recognise that incarna in its current state does not represent the actual vision for this feature. (for reference look at previous fanfest videos)this is not a request that ccp drop everything that they are doing to focus on incarna. what it is, is a request that ccp provide clarity on the future of incarna, recognising that it represents only one playstyle among the many possible in eve, and worthy of further development just as those other playstyles are <U+FFFD> and certainly should not be abandoned.so my specific request to the csm, is that they ask ccp to clarify what is going to happen with incarna. is it not going to be looked at for 12 months. will the multiplayer establishments arrive during this period.thanks"
"i see no problem with this. like it or not, incarna is part of eve now, and there is a reasonable contingent that wants to see it iterated on. i hope that, with the focus on development shifted back to eve, ccp will be able to continue to appeal to the fis people while continuing to improve on the incarna experience for those players that are interested in it. as long as the future developments to incarna are in line with the general ethos of eve, i'm all for seeing something interesting come out of it. it'd be good to get an idea of whether or not wis is completely on halt, or simply working with a reduced staff."
"i would also like ccp to clarify the status and future plans for wis."
"there's a future for incarna?"
"plain and simple guys -- ccp ****** up with the way they rolled out incarna, in allowing the fis stuff to stagnate for about two years (hence the :18 months: meme from a number of the vets). they nearly completely halted iterating on incarna and wod for the moment, because they realised that they were in a very tenuous place with eve (and thus, with all their other plans) so did a very quick turnaround and gave us crucible. crucible is seriously their \"plan b\" release, done in a few weeks to make people happy again. hell, look at the trailer even -- it's reminiscent of eve never fades (and some of the other \"great\" trailers of old) -- they even went so far as to use fraps captures of the game rather than the pre-rendered \"cinematic trailers\" that they've been doing since dominion. likely what we'll see happen is a focus on fis, and a lot of the things that have been broken for a long time for the next 2-3 patch cycles, with maybe some wis stuff thrown in as well. what'll likely happen is 18 months of neglect for wis beyond \"simple\" things, and then afterwards a balanced wis/fis approach thereafter..."
"have no fear. i am sure that ccp is working very hard with the csm to improve 0.0."
"incarna was an expansion. it came...that's that. what the question should be is...what is the future of wis?"
"however you want to articulate the question is fine. the point is that we want clarification."
"your own fault, but still supported.first offense should carry very little sec penalty, which get exponentially higher on subsequent offense in highsec. penalty remains flat at initial small amount in lowsec."
"bullcrap.if its like any other device of any kind you got 1 warning when you initially triggered it and chose to ignore for any number of random reasons.heck even a smart bomb triggers an warning even if there's nothing near by to strike.and if this is your first time getting concordokened... then you don't have alot to throw a fit about.this has to be a stealth thread for nerfing concord or a trollthread.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"my first experience with concord was when i tried to kill a mining ship of some sort with my thrasher. i thought i could kill it and get away before concord showed up. i was wrong on both counts. i'd been playing for maybe 24 hours at that point. and no, i have nothing constructive to say about this proposal."
"there should be a tutorial mission which warps you somewhere and shows you a popup \"click ok to have your ship destroyed, click cancel to continue\". if you click ok, you get promptly blown up in whatever ship you are (no refunds). the mission restarts and you can't continue until you complete it. maybe that would teach people to read."
"i wouldn't object to the notion that \"repeat offenders\" should lose more sec status. it would mirror the way we treat real-life criminals.that said, i do find it a little troubling that it's possible to draw concord without a warning. ccp has several times made changes in order to prevent people being surprised by aggression or gcc, and this is an instance that might warrant a look. edit: it seems other people have had warnings when they fired aoe weapons. if that's the case, i have no sympathy for the op."
"i once had an member that fired a smart bomb *edit* forgot to mention it was a navy issue megathorn*edit* with a warning issued only to get concorded due to fireing one at a an asteriod in a mission.i was equally warned repeatedly for each time i fired a smart bomb for grins in various areas.the op is trolling.it's way too obvious.if it was that big of a deal it would be a rampant outcry from various sources...not some \"face in the crowd\"================ stop the evemail spam!"
"years ago i fired an aoe and immediately got blasted: obvious and reasonable. no complaints there. here no damage of any kind was done.seems some people can't read - i received no warning and i've disabled no aggression popup windows. multiple complaints:- concord over reacted to the use of a non-destructive device- many hours worth of security standing lost in a first time \"offence\""

"2-3 hours of sp for attending a mass test, i wouldn't care. a person attending every single one would get one day ahead of someone who doesn't over the course of one year. i probably lose more sp than that due to getting podded and needing new implants, or forgetting to update my queue. the efforts of these people make the game better for everyone. although i agree that aur or perhaps a unique vanity shirt would be better.rewards for reporting bugs? no please. the last thing a programmer wants to do is to dig through fifty thousand bug reports saying \"my ship no work\"."

"people would make the calculation and weigh the cost versus the benefit. they get to make the decision.it does not remove all risk.why should ships be the only way to close a wormhole?"
"it does. a pack of these could insta pop any hole they wanted to. align wh with celestial, approach, drop bomb, warp off: no risk."
"the wormhole collapses due to mass being transferred through it. you're asking for a bomb that would close a wormhole without pushing mass through it.the only way i can see this being even remotely balanced is by making the bombs so costly to produce that it would cost hundreds of millions to close the smallest wormholes."
"the only problem i have with cloaking is that it makes you 100% safe.cloaking roam run into something you can't beat that has you trapped down a pipe? cloak upwant to take an afk break in the middle of hostile space? cloak upwant to camp out someone else's system in a t2 frigate and not get shot at by their home defense fleet? cloak upcan't fight someone who is just better at flying than you are? cloak upsmall gang jumps into local while you are ratting / mining? cloak up i'd give cloaked ships a (very small) sig radius so that people could track you down using the little probing mini game.i have also seen suggestions for a cloaking fuel bay that would run out in 2-3 hours, but that would only really fix the afk cloaking.by the way, as a bit of space street cred my old corp was pretty damn successful at being dicks with cloaks,"
"within the next 5 years i would like to see a better looking, more emergent and dynamic eve.today, eve is very stale gameplay wise. i think a gradual shift of incentivized economic activity to combat areas will create more emergent gameplay and breathe fresh air into eve. more ratters, miners, haulers and industrialists in lowsec/nullsec means a more target rich environment. with more targets you can facilitate a change to local mechanics-- as long as you keep some method of facilitating pvp you will draw in even more people.nullsec sovereignty needs to move away from structures and be more centered around a dynamic approach that determines sov based on system activity.lowsec should have its barrier to entry reduced. remove or mitigate the sec status hit-- there needs to be a way to facilitate pick up and play pvp for weekend warriors. possibly look at removing the ability to deploy fighterbombers in lowsec. lowsec in general could be expanded upon-- better faction warfare, viable anti-pirating, a better bounty system, etc.highsec should remain a center of both commerce and manufacturing. it should also be a viable place to live, albeit with a lesser incentive than riskier areas. missions need to be redone in such a way that they are not a one stop shop for minerals, isk, and lp."
"i think ccp needs to seriously rethink \"microtransactions\" . vanity items would be fine as would some wis items if that ever comes to be. but the pricing needs to be retooled completely 65 bucks for a fancy pixel eye patch is insane. but we shouldn't have to keep repeating this topic over and over the actions of this past summer should speak for it's self"
"this is such a garbage stat. it's 92% of characters. when you consider how many dead trial characters are in highsec as well as everybody's jita alt, of course 92% of the characters are in highsec."
"the answer is shockingly simple. how come concord pays you in imperial spacebuxx when you kill people in the lawless frontier? why can you trade your imperial spacebuxx for things on the fringes of the galaxy?in ye olde times, how much trade was accomplished by an agreed upon item? so my fix is simple. cash made in different regions is only good for that region! you wanna run hs missions all day? good on you, you just made 1bil imperial insured guaranteed \"in god we trust\" spacebuxx. have fun only using that to shop in hs stations.lowsec income (lol) is the same, you get black market spacebuxx. only can shop in lowsec with it. lowsec people dont trust imperial spacebuxx, only their agreed upon currency.same for 0.0. when the influence of the galactic governments is half a galaxy away ... i don't care how much they say their cash is worth/represents. ill trade you a gun for that piece of metal."
"emphasized the important part of the statement. crucible is not the csm. how many people would have resubscribed if the csm is not as it is now? truly, we'll never know for sure, leaving lots of leverage for guesswork..."
"crucible is a laundry list of changes proposed and developed by the csm. this is the only expansion so far that has directly been the result of csm recommended changes and, surprise surprise, people are resubbing in massive numbers. perhaps this csm actually works and makes the game enjoyable?but i'm just blue-skying here, i'm sure it's all a goonie conspiracy and we're all out to ruin everything for everyone."
"crucible is the embodiment of the sixth csm's insistence on a focus on fis. without the csm, it's pretty damned likely that this expansion would have just been incarna 2.0. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"fyp"
"i realize that you're a moron, but you have to give the csm credit for many of the crucible changes, most notably supercapital balancing. or are you bitter about that particular aspect?i mean if the csm was so useless, why the hell would you be making such terrible posts about them? \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"i realize that you're a troll, but for the benefit of the others:yes, i'm willing to give csm vi credit for nerfing supercaps, pos fuel pellets and time dilation (none of which are what the vast majority of players are happy about.) the mass unsubscriptions get credit for everything else (most notably, the fact that this expansion was overwhelmingly a fis expansion ). ccp watched what we did (unsubscribed in droves.) they didn't listen to what csm vi said.and if you weren't trolling and had read the op, you'd know i didn't say the csm was 'so useless.' let me try again: \"to the limited extent to which this pathetic excuse for a csm has achieved any tangible results, they have represented their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the game.\""

"i believe it would be enough already if the acceptance of the application requires a session change,but the old mechanic has to go away anyway, because it's seriously flawed.anyway, writing \"without being seen in local/overview\" is the wrong wording,because he's seeable in local/on overview, but he's not seen as flashy red.big difference."
"session change and can only fight 30 minutes after being accepted."
"how about just requirement of being docked to be accepted?? you can't leave a corp without docking either afaik."
"it's currently against the rules, petition when it happens.as for fixing it: require that they dock up to complete the application. the game already requires that you be docked to apply. this would just add an extra step. you dock up and apply to a corporation that corp reviews your app, and if it is accepted, you are sent an \"offer\" (for lack of a better term) you dock up and accept the offer you are now a member of the corp and can immediately begin doing anything any other member of the corp can do."
"i think the meta or political side of the game needs to be introduced to newer players. even a short video that plays in the cq or something introducing the various areas in space and how and why players fight over them. maybe a tutorial mission that sends them to a random nearby lowsec system to fetch something would help newer players get over the lowsec is scary feeling. give them the lowdown on how to travel safely though lowsec-- it's very hard to get nabbed in a frigate in lowsec."
"the ui does need to be redone. it needs to be done very carefully though. bring in ui experts. take your time. don't try and cram it into one release cycle if it won't fit. eve is a ui heavy game, i don't think there is a way to get around that but i think it could look better and be more streamlined at the same time."
"i think csm should take a look at the features & ideas discussions on daily bases... there there are allot of complains and sugestions about all sort of eve features... and since noone from the dev teams take care of that part of the forum... i think you guys could have a use for it... new pos system new sov system"
"i would really like to see remodeling of the ugly ship models: dominix, moa, aeon and probably a few others. the first three at least are a real eyesore.the maller remodeling was nice."
"in order:- do whatever has to be done so poss can be redone. most pos owners would take a bunch of featureless grey blocks at this point.- streamline corp/alliance interface into something like windows server 2003-in space so that role management isn't a second job.- modernize ui appearance.- addition font options (classic, serif, modern, comic sans, etc.)"
"oh here's another - make it so when you kill a capital ship it's replaced with a model of the burnt, destroyed version of the wrecked ship instead. then work your way down. that'd be pretty cool as far as the goal of 'immersion' goes."
"<U+FFFD>contracts should be made limitless<U+FFFD>eve started that way. trade skills were added. the community was in an uproar. they are there for a variety of reasons. eve is a big place. if everyone had infinite buy/sell orders it would tax the server and make entry more difficult.<U+FFFD>buying and selling should be possible from across the universe instead of being region-restricted<U+FFFD>this would actually hurt trade and flatten the game. buying low and selling high is more likely to occur with regional segmenting.<U+FFFD>no sensible person likes grinding<U+FFFD>1. you have to make choices in who you will side with. 2. you don<U+FFFD>t want l4s to open up to people who can only fly cruisers.3. you won<U+FFFD>t get l4/5s handed to you, nor do you deserve to.<U+FFFD>planet management<U+FFFD>ok, now you just sound lazy and want everything. you have enough planets, and while i support saving settings for reconfiguration, you are still going to have to do some work.<U+FFFD>subsystems<U+FFFD>sorry, but no. the skill requirements for t3 are pretty low imho. too low, i think.<U+FFFD>revert all of nullsec<U+FFFD>it needs an overhaul. i don<U+FFFD>t think there is a simple solution.<U+FFFD>cloaks<U+FFFD>until someone suggests a way to counter cloaks that won<U+FFFD>t make them worthless, leave it be. there has to be ways of gathering intel.<U+FFFD>over to learning implants<U+FFFD>learning implants have gotten cheaper and cheaper as years have gone by. you only need two, and two +4s are not expensive. you want to have +5s without the risk. as for attributes, you want everyone one to train as slowly as you do. you should have choices: throttle one type to the max, best overall with perception and intelligence, or a general median for general training.cost is the real issue. i support lowering the price of +5s and releasing +6/7s at the +5 rate. then we could train faster. i bet that wouldn<U+FFFD>t make you happy because highsec people would have them but not low/nullsec. that <U+FFFD>highsec envy<U+FFFD> is no excuse. i also support attribute boosters, illegal in empire, to balance it out. combined with cheap implants, those in nullsec would be able to train faster than those in highsec for less cost.read more in my posts there."
"no. that would make the markets a lot less interesting and made trading and shipping far less interesting as occupations.then you can stop right there.this again? seriously, cloaking isn't going away. i want a covops battlecruiser, not less cloaking.pick an implant, use it. want faster learning? give up isk and combat bonuses. want the best combat bonuses? slower learning. it's a choice. don't take it away."

"any faction warfare \"little things\" you fix now without the overhaul will end up like the new plexing mechanic, an easy exploit. you can now flip a system in under 2 days. and when your faction is full of non pvp oriented mission bears you cant get any one orginized to stop it. oh wait, it still doesnt matter weather or not your stop it, you can still go and mission from it, you still get your stuff, and only a single name change happens when it flips. seriously, they could dedicate two expansions to the problems it has, ie: lack of purpose to plexing, fail reward system that encourages not pvping, auto entry and lack of spai removal, ect, ect, ect.first step is get them to release the vision that was fw at the begining, and tell us why it didnt happen. you know, that mythical communication we heard so much about. and the blog that was supposed to come out after the gaffe during fan fes... im done now."
"agreed. any negative/positive effects should be clearly displayed on your ship fittings window also."
"and that's where the second part of my posting comes in: as soon as you have the skills trained to v - and people will do it - it's either \"it never works\" (if defensive skills are stronger) or \"it always works\" (offensive skills are stronger). and people robbing me blind just because i'm offline and can't retaliate?no thanks."

"they did boost exploration. maybe you should take a good look at the patch notes, oh and learn how to spell, use grammer, and maybe proper english too.they just didn't boost your silly haven/sanctum carebear easymode money making.as a low sec explorer, i'm enjoying the fruits of this boost immensely, and just wishing i lived in a different low sec region."
"allready done but actualy i not saa eny boost, for now there, not more sites not les sites the same sites almost in the same sstems where usualy they spawn, afcors for explarotion testing need more site to see the stabilty off sites and stabilty off outome from them. that way io not talking about exploration. ok i wil keep tesiting exploration let see wath wil come out. for now how far i scaned its araund 2 sites per constelation, but not stable ones if you run out there will be not next imn place. i personaly wuld low that that wuld be the same as hiden belts, you scan out one shoot it and get faction loot or not get faction loot, then after some time 30 min or 1 hour in the same sytems spawns next one. and so one. that boters cant get get to easy money pritning."
"you might want to aquaint yourself with fanfest videos from previous years. you will see that there is indeed support for walking in stations and the vision ccp had for it. most of the complaints against incarna were against it's implementation (single room and nex store), not the original design intent.players want walking in stations, not the incomplete feature that we got.learn the difference."
"plasma: interesting, but in the end not much different than anything else we already havephotons: we have lasers alreadynanite: which would be delivered on a missile but interestingphasers: scifi trek technobabble, no place in any sci fi universe that wants to stand on its owndark matter: could be interesting...turbo lasers: literally, supercharged lasers... we have those, they are called tachsphase inhibitors: random nonsensical technobabble... could call them phased modulated warp inhibition extraneous generators... and it would have the same meaning.sonics: ahahahahahahahhahahahah.... really, nopulse: pulses of what? pulses of air... heat... corpses...gravametric blasters: cool, but would not work as crushing is not a damage type in eve.and missiles will always be around. they are the simplest way to deliver a payload to a moving target."
"don't bother responding to zircon, he's made it clear he's just a mindless nullbear who thinks eve is all about his playstyle. that, and he's really really bad at presenting arguments (does he even have one?)."
"i live in nullsec. i simply think that this is a good idea. where someone resides in a vidya game has zero weight on their opinion. zircon is a moron on his own accord."
"cool, i see this thread has found its troll. i guess that's a sure sign it's a good idea ;) i especially like the fact he still hasn't explained why he claims lowsec is sustainable without alts or recovering sec, despite being asked to.about the lowsec mining stuff, i'm not so sure it would entice many miners to lowsec, certainly not the casual miners that do a large amount of highsec mining anyway. what it would do is make lowsec mining an absolute necessity for production, which will lead to the price of everything going up, since the only people able to produce this ore are those that are capable of defending mining operations. in my experience of miners, very few have the ability or the inclination to do that. i'm not so sure that's a good idea, unless of course you're in the minority that reckons they are able to successfully defend lowsec mining operations, and fancy some higher profits :pas for negative sec people being shootable without gate aggro, i really don't think that'll be a problem for the average highsec dweller who goes to lowsec occasionally. if you live in highsec, and are into shooting stuff, chances are you spend most of your time pveing. if the lowest your sec could drop from lowsec pvp was -1.99, then highsec pve being your main activity will quite quickly work off that hit, even if you go on a total bender. since part of the proposal was that shooting someone with negative sec has no repercussion, the only reason your sec would ever drop would be if you were shooting people with positive sec anyway. basically this would be turning anti-piracy from a bit of rp fluff into a semi-profession that's actually supported by game mechanics."
"i'm not saying people who live in 0.0 do not have valid opinions, but zircon is just one of those bleating lambs who wants the devs' attention to be on all null sec, all the time. he came into a thread about a low sec fix trying to champion 0.0 buffs"
"as being someone who lived 2+ years as -10 it isnt hard to supply yourself without an alt. yes i had a hauler, but i can count the number of times i used it to bring me supplies on one hand. maybe i was lucky though. i was able to keep stocked from loot, the occasional foray onto the market, and working out deals with friends. then again, i set up some nice relationships after ransoming a few haulers.... not everyone honors ransoms though so maybe they don't get that benefit.when i decided to leave low it sure was a pita grinding up sec. would not having to bother with that been nice? sure. if i had not been lazy i would have never been in that position in the first place. it is pitifully easy to keep your sec up if you are not camping gates for haulers and you work solo. the sec hit you get from fights where the other person shoots back is minimal. that is why i am not sure there is any real incentive for weekend warriors. those players tend to be running around solo or in 2-3 man gangs.the people i do see this helping are those corporations who want to engage in pos-centric activities without living in low, and those corps who need highsec access so they can shoot wt's (but who want to go to low when things get slow). the first group i may have some sympathy for. defending a pos will result in sec hits. making things easier for them to mitigate those hits is something i am on the fence about. the latter group i have no sympathy for.tbh i think there are two questions i have not seen brought up though.first, why would making more people flashy boost pvp when people can't or won't shoot red flashies already? the gate guns wont shoot you if you make a move on a red flashy, nor do you get a sec hit. but almost nobody engaged me when i was -10 that wouldn't have engaged me if i +5. making a mechanic that nobody takes advantage of seems kind of pointless so maybe i am missing something. second, why does everyone insist that low sec needs more pvp? it already accounts for 30% of pvp in the game, hotzones already rival the 0.0 hotzones in terms of average kills/day, and even the quiet systems see more traffic than the quietest 0.0 systems. all the verifable data says that low is doing just fine, even though all the forum warrior data tells a different story. until someone can answer the last question i won't support any boost low sec!!!111 thread."
"i've spent about 2.5 years in metropolis/sinq laison low sec, and from my experience a lot of people don't necessarily think that low sec needs more pvp, its just that the pvp that exists needs to be less of a hassle to maintain. as things are now if you want to play eve as an exclusive (or almost) pvper it is very hard to sustain yourself. without good corp logistics an alt becomes a necessity even for things like spare mods and ammo, much less ships. then there is the issue of income. the way player loot drops can either make your day or ruin your week depending on how the loot fairy is feeling so it can't be relied upon for consistent income. if there was a way an pvper could make isk just through pvp then i think you'd see a lot less low sec whines. it could be something like a pirate corp getting sponsored by npc pirates that places bounties on positive sec players. that is just an example ofc, there are a great many ways ccp could make piracy and more casual low sec pvp a self sustaining activity. people don't like being shoehorned into a play style in order to sustain the one they enjoy."
"+1 supported, this would be amazing. agree with 5 minute gcc in lowsec too."
"some that seem concerned this idea prompts inexperienced pilots to dip their toes in pvp waters en-masse. others voice their worries that low sec will be transformed from the tranquil, occasionally hostile backwater it is now in to a zoo of space-weapon-firing activity.to them i say: good.yes, i'm biased towards small gangs, but what i'd really like to see are more fights. i'm fully behind any mechanic that encourages pvp. let the low-sec arena begin."
"on the whole, i think this is a good idea. however, it does feel like a bit of a slap in the face for those who are currently -10 as a result of actions that would be effectively decriminalised under the new system."
"it's easy for the dedicated player, not so much for the more casual ones. i have no problem with it myself, even when i'm not outlaw, i use hauler alts to bring me the stuff for the most part. but when i was running corp logistics, you'd be surprised how many people complained about having to bring their own mods in, when we already provided the hulls. and a 100k sp alt in a frigate can bring fittings for several ships.that's a different point, but the way sec and aggression works is unbalanced. it only works in 1v1. with two gangs shooting each other, only 2 primaries will be taking fire at any given time. so anyone who is not primaried will get the full sec hit.people do it. ok, yes, there's a lot of puzzling people who go to lowsec in pvp fit ships, but don't engage anything. it's a mystery. but others are happy to.in any case, the main point of the proposal is the cap on sec loss, so people can dip in and out of lowsec without having to rat their brains out. the second part, making more people \"flashy\" was actually to keep the one advantage being -10 has now, the chance of getting the occasional sentry-free fight.that only tells me that 0.0 needs some fixing, too but i'm curious about the distribution of those kills. how many of those kills are from pure gatecamps? how many are concentrated in the fw areas?lowsec is not as broken as other people want you to believe. i enjoy it more than i do 0.0 gangs. but the fun, memorable fights, are not common enough. i just want to turn it up a bit, get more random small gangs coming through.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"man i love it when the ladies gush on and on about me after i leave. <3 to you all too but it is not meant to be. my space-boyfriend would be really mad."
"last i heard, lowsec still required starbase charters and empire standings to anchor a pos, the same as 0.5 - 0.7. i've always wondered...who enforces that, since there are no patrols by the empire?"
"i live in empire and think all 0.0 logistics should have to be done with frieghters. derp.ignorance makes it easy to think bad ideas are really good."
"they do not require standings and charters."
"this was only in 0.4, not in deeper lowsec, and it was removed 2-3 expansions ago.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"maybe if you read the the link you would have figured out the obvious. low sec doesnt need to be fixed. all this thread wants is consequence free pvp without going to 0.0. if this thread asked for something reasonable, like decreasing the granularity in the multiplier, i would have supported it. this idea is ******** though. it is not in keeping with eve philosophy, it does nothing to incentize the groups it claims to incentivize, and gives the \"i want eve to be fps\" crowd cookies."
"oh, finally you gave something ressembling a reasoning.there is no consequence free pvp in eve. ship losses take care of that. but ignoring that, i'd argue why lowsec should have those consequences, and not highsec wardecs or 0.0 ratter ganks.do elaborate, please.why does eve philosophy apply to lowsec, but not highsec or 0.0?removing a punishment is pretty much the same as adding an incentive.mmm... cookies.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"with the exception of me calling troll the reasons are there. are you suggesting that i need to spoon feed more? i still call troll btw. plenty of people live/ pvp in lowsec without relying on alts to feed them ships and modules.if you are shooting wts then there is no consequence in lowsec either.what part is unclear?shoot non wt's in highsec. what happens to your security? the gradual diminuation of severity as system security decreases is constant. so what are you on about?edit: inappropriate part removed, ccp phantom"
"figures. it was a 0.4 i was trying to set up in, and it probably got patched away shortly after and i missed it in the patch notes.still, some documentation i read somewhere gave me the idea it was all lowsec that needed charters.another case of eve utterly lacking good, clear documentation and relying on fan sites to provide users with information."
"you still haven't said how. i have given the reasons why it's not feasible. prove me wrong.let's start with the granularity of which multiplier.it's not really constant. in highsec, you lose ship and sec, in lowsec you lose sec and risk losing your ship (try engaging in a frig under sentries), in 0.0 you get neither.so if you remove the punishments from pvp, you won't get carebears to pvp, but some of the closet pvpers who run back to highsec every time they approach -2 will stay in lowsec.edit: inappropriate part removed, ccp phantomwhat happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"you replied to a post that showed how ffs. loot, market, industrial corps and traders, friends. this thread is about sec status right? might i be speaking of the multiplier to sec loss? well since you stated you were ignoring ship losses and a generous context to the entire thread is sec status, it is constant. so again.... what are you on about?this seems like a strange justification. if they are running back to highsec because thier sec status is low, but would stay if thier sec status was not in danger, then i can only surmise that you think they are going back to highsec to gain sec. no doubt some people will, but only because they do not know it is faster to grind in lowsec. it seems more probable that they are going back to highsec because they think they can make more isk there. if this is correct, then they will not stay in lowsec any longer than they already do."
"the first two have no guarantee they will have what you need. industrial corps will happily provide you with ships... in highsec next door to low (admitedly, last time i tried this, black frog didn't exist). friends is just someone else's alts. try it sometime, you'll see how it goes.maybe it's faster, but i'm not so sure. finding bs rats is very hit or miss, not like 0.0. and obviously, isk does come into the equation: you can try ratting in up in lowsec, take 10 hours and make 100 mil. or do it semi afk in highsec, take 20 hours but make 600 mil.if they go back to highsec when they run out of isk, that's fine by me. it's no different than a -10 logging off his main and grinding missions on an alt for a bit. it's being \"sent\" back to highsec for being successful that's silly.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"hardly. their -10 is a lifestyle choice...field of trolls: \"if you chum it, they will come.\""
"as a side note: sentries not having tracking is rather unfair to frig/cruiser pilots...and nullsec pvp is problematic at best for casual types (getting bubbled and podded repeatedly, and/or getting crap dropped on your head by ex-sovholders who seem to have a penchant for fleeing to npc null, never mind the kind of hornets you can stir up in other folks' sovspace)."
"unless the primary in your gang is flashy the entire opposing gang is able to be aggressed without penalty. since the people who bounce between high and low are by definition those who are not -5 this is not an issue in small gang fights so much. if you want to aggress haulers, mission runners, people who want to run away, etc obviously everyone gets the sec hit. i am not sure this is bad. maybe i just do not fit in with current eve culture, but to me it seems like a good thing to penalize a shoot everything that moves policy within empire. especially since there are several other areas of the game where that penalty does not exist, nor is it a particularly onerous penalty with a little forethought.in regards to the statistics i mentioned, i do not know for sure about how many are camps. i tracked average kills/ day for about two month using dotlan info. i kept both a log of random systems and standard hot systems (hed, amamake, etc). obviously the fw areas saw an increase over non-fw, but the randomized system list showed that low sec was pretty competative. the bottom rung low sec systems still saw more jumps per week than 0.0. again these were averaged numbers so that single large fleet engagements would scew the picture less. the general picture you get from ccp devblog fits with what i gathered on my own.p.s- speaking from experience ratting sec up in low sec is way faster than doing the l4 mission tour if you spend 10min setting things up right in a series of connected systems."
"well since friends cant count because it is someone elses alt: then black frog can't count because they use alts. and buying anything from highsec hubs cant count because the traders are alts that got goods from other alts. and those goods were made by mission runners/mining alts and industrial alts. oh noes!!! i get it nao!!! everyone who is not you is an alt. or maybe you should get out more.actually i have been profiting off it for about 2 years now. thanks"
"of course the goons in null and their 2 month old playerbase are going to push this. this is only a benefit to null groups who dont normally use implants due to the risk which is what i thought the game was about. sadly enough and i hate to use the term, its null sec carebearing. they can't use implants, their low sp playerbase (which goons are known for) doesn't use them due to risk. so hey lets all push getting rid of them and up the learning speed 5x. its bogus and a misuse of the what the csm was created for. especially as the csm including null sec in general is just a joke nowadays. tell you what ccp, make this change and advance every older player their +5x accelerated learning from the past 8 years. next years proposal, get rid of sp, everyone can use everything. pfft get real.goons, proceed to troll/throw out cornball insults. /endrantoh yea, lets get rid of remaps as well."
"double post"
"are you care bears kidding me?! they don't discourage anyone from anything. you want to jump clone out to another clone somewhere else? put the same implants in that clone and you don\"t lose anything. it makes null sec more costly? that's the entire point of this game. the risk in this game is what makes it fun. you want to play where the big boys play? you are going to have to take bigger risks and possibly lose more isk. deal with it. you want a game where dying doesn't have any consequences go play wow. 3/4 out the crap in this game is indeed trivial. but that is what makes eve what it is. that is why we all love playing this game, because it isn't easy. all this does is make the game easier for new players. which coincidentally is generally what goonswarm is made of. honestly this is a blatant move for them to get ahead in this game. if ccp really goes along with this then they need to pull their balls out of their @$$ and get off goons junk. eve is difficult. eve makes you take risks and pay for your mistakes. that is why we all play it and enjoy playing it. imo this game has never been about making life easier for the new player, but about the gratification you get when you find your feet. this is just another step in taking that away."
"and that is all this was about. time to start imposing 1 term limits. alil ridiculous when the head of one of the largest alliances can keep getting himself voted in. especially when the majority of posters are goons."
"side note to those b@tching about jump clones. they are meant to be there as a minor convenience. not as a form of fast travel. being able to jump around the galaxy at will, without haveing to take the risk of physically traveling from a to b, would severely hamper pvp.just because you guys don't have the gohanes to take a risk doesn't mean the game is flawed. it just means you don't know how to play that well. yes at times things can be inconvenient. get over it and go do something else in game. its not like this game is one-dimensional"
"/facepalmyou gotta be ******* kidding me........?so because nullsec players are too cheap to fly with them, the people who aren't get screwed ? +5 implant sets are expensive. so why exactly would you think that people wouldn't be pissed about losing them ? why should we be out hundreds of millions of isk so that we can lessen the gap between new and old players ?i had to work my ass off for enough money to get my first set of +5 implants a few years back. i fail to see why a brand new player should have the same attributes as me right out of the gate. one of the things that attracted me to this game in the first place was the complexity of what eve online really is. i understood that i was sorely out classed by the older players of the game and knew that i would have to work hard in this game to be able to compete. you know what, i enjoyed every minute of it. i had a sense of accomplishment in training my learning skills and buying my first set of +5 implants. this game is starting to stray away from that. everyone thinks they should be in the biggest ship in the least amount of time. this game should never be about people being the best they can be without any of the work. if you do that, then eve is no longer eve. its just whats left over of a game that used to be great. also, i don't feel that you should be able to train your alts up with all the sp boosts you would get from +5 implants without having to spend the money for them. if your lazy and don't want to spend the time making the isk for them, buy plex. if your worried about losing them in 0.0 then maybe 0.0 isn't the place for you. if your that worried about losing implants them your obviously not going to fly any ships that actually cost some real isk. i have nothing against goons or mittani personally, but this is an idea i can in no way support. i do see a mass of goons supporting this idea for whatever reason but if you guys want to be in 0.0 then you should have to take the bad with the good. null is supposed to be a dangerous place. a lawless place. it shouldn't be a place where you no longer care about getting podded because implants have been removed from the game. in 0.0, having implants means you have more incentive to win a fight. if you have a jc then jump to it so you won't lose them and take the hit to your sp/hour. i would however support a timer change on jump clones. take the timer down from 24 hours to 12 hours. that is something i could get behind."
"tl;dr: i want zero loss when i get podded, but also all the benefits of +5s at no cost."
"replace them with more combat and useful implants so that people will still get podded with 100m implant sets if they want to win at war. problem solved."

"they do if they train cybernetics and run missions to get the isk. there is no reason you should have everything handed to you just because your a noob."
"that is part of the risk of living in an area with no law. why exactly shouldn't there be disadvantages to living in 0.0 ? seeming that the pros far outweigh the cons. not to mention that if someone jcs to highsec before an op, they are morons. plain and simple. if someone jcs to highsec to train in +5 implants.....well, they can do that sitting in any one of your numerous station systems."
"i'm saying that new players don't follow hyperoptimized skillplans focused on two attributes. \"only buy what you need\" doesn't really apply. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"

"that is very true. however, if they join a corp or alliance instead of sitting in noob corp forever, they could learn from more experienced players. that was how i learned to play this game when i first joined. if your talking about what is best for new players, then we need to consider a way to teach them to play and how to train skills. not eliminate parts of the game to make life easier for them."

"our alliance suffered two keylogger attacks this week. while we expected ccp to fix the damage, they told our guys that ccp's policy is to only give players back the isk for which the items were sold, not the items themselves and not their fair market value. ccp's reasoning is that to make proper reparations would negatively affect the server economy.in reality, ccp's standing policy is a big handout to isk-sellers. all they need to do to take advantage is to place really low buy orders in a handful of places, hack the targeted accounts, and sell off their t2 ships, minerals, and pos fuels to make their billions. the offending account will get banned, but the buyers' accounts will rake in the profit without ever falling under scrutiny. the current policy therefore aids isk-sellers while harming honest, paying customers.i would like ccp to release data on how many keylogged former customers have quit eve in disgust over this policy, and i would like to see ccp revise the policy so it no longer benefits people committing felonies in the real world and disrupting our game community. after all, you try telling a police officer who arrests you for grand larceny \"i can't help get back the mercedes i stole because it would negatively affect the black market.\" try it, i dare you.in the civilised world, stolen property is confiscated and returned to its owner while those found in possession of stolen property have criminal charges filed against them. why should ccp policy not reflect thousands of years of law enforcement wisdom?as far as i can tell, the only reason is that ccp does not want to do the work of fixing these problems. but there are a number of simple steps that ccp could take to make the game more secure from keyloggers. first, we could have the option to anchor our email, that way when a keylogger tries to change an account's email address, he gets blocked and his ip gets banned. second, in both of our alliance's instances, the keyloggers logged into the account while it was being played actively, this knocking it offline from another ip address. considering this is a blatant violation of the eula, ccp could write simple code to auto-ban the account in these instances, and then un-ban it once the customer's computer is secure.revising the policy need not drain time and money from ccp, but the current policy is offensive to your dedicated customer base. it's high time the policy was revisited.-jm"

"i was about to post the exact same thing but the forum ate my post. stop buying isk and visiting illegit sites and you won't get keylogged."
"agreed (against op).... if you aren't responcibile with your account...placing blame on the system to recover it isn't going to cover it up.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"all i did was downloaded the update to adobe flash player. it installed a 3rd-party toolbar without my knowledge. the toolbar then installed the trojan.but this is not about me wanting isk back. the policy ccp has for dealing with it encourages isk selling and benefits isk sellers while hurting those of us who play the game honestly. i have bought 2 plexs in my entire 5 years, as ccp can confirm.the policy needs to change so isk sellers are not compensated for committing criminal acts.-jm"
"p. sure that the flash updates give you a \"check here if you don't want our 3rd party crap\" box..."
"lol? and from whre did you get a flash update that instals 3rd party toolbars? not from adobe site for sure :pon a more serious note. i kind off partially agree that more account security should be in place, but you resoning is little off. for example e-mail adress, why should i not be able to change e-mail adress? a legitimate player wantig to change his own acc mail get banned?or auto banning for loging from different ip. you know we have those ip changing internet providers right? mine resets connection every 24 hours and gets me new ip in process. imagine this happening on a laggy cluster where server will not notice me loosing connection before i log back from different ip.soooo yes for more security in place - things like banks have, or whatever. but not what you are proposing.and for market orders. right now i can tell you ow a creative player can make huge billions if ccp will act the way you propose with stollen stuff and money, but i hope you can figure out for yourself.read and support: don't mess with our wh's what is your stance on wh stuff?"
"last time i used adobe's flash installer on their site, it offered google toolbar. that said, gt isn't likely to come packing a trojan keylogger.more could be done to make it harder to switch e-mails (such as sending a mail to the current e-mail address on file, and waiting 7 days to fully transfer), but you're right that preventing it entirely means students with university e-mails would lose access to their eve account upon graduation. bad idea.some people play from more than one location: home, school, work, a friend's house, whatever."
"auto-install was hacked.that's not what i said. i said you should have the \"option\" to anchor your email. if you don't want, you don't have to.nevertheless, there are many solutions ccp could and should look at. currently they are focusing on game content while a new wave of keylogging attacks is spreading across the game."
"the non-replacement / non-reimbursement policy *does* encourage the behaviour that jehan is asserting. exploits occur all the time, in all areas of software. i'd feel more comfortable with my two accounts and all the time and money i invest in the game that i don't get the kind of treatment that two members of my alliance have recieved from ccp with regard to their handling of these issues. blame the victim seems to be the going theme of a few people here... enjoy a lonelier dog-eat-dog and soon to be dead mmo if that continues. some technologies to force a single step of authentication with a browser to enable logging in from a different pc to your account would be a trivial and high value enhancement to the game. look at xbox app activations or just the other examples of banking system logins etc... it would've stopped both of these types of attacks cold.ccp shouldn't be prickish about peoples hard earned stuff when the investigation shows there's scams like this that hit them."

"unless you've disabled warnings, there should have been a warning. if things did, in fact, happen to you as you describe, then that's a bug; petition it. that said, since there is a warning, you should already be aware of the consequences when you activate the module, so no change or leniency is needed."
"it is very difficult to know where to begin here. first off, i suggested a number of ways that these bombs could work, one of which was a half life method that would remove a fraction of the current total mass and therefore could never actually close it. if these bombs are expensive, then the diminishing return would mean that people would likely just use them to get a head start on closing a hole. this directly addresses your objection. secondly, a pack of orcas can destroy a hole in the time it takes for the session change timer to run down. warp them through, and you'll be able to warp back before your cloak wears off. less than a minute, closed hole, guaranteed. is this objectionable? i can only guess the scenario you imagine is of someone dropping combat scanner probes the second local lights up, locating the wormhole and warping to it, then destroying an orca or two before their session timers wind down and they jump back through the hole? this does not insta pop wormholes.the wormholes that people \"travel\" through are really just colorful facades put over the exact same code that governs stargates. the thing that closes wormholes is a variable in a ccp database on a server in london. the reason why mass and time are currently the only ways to close a wormhole is because those are the only two things that affect that particular variable.now, as a practical matter, i do agree with you. firing a bomb of any existing type at a wormhole will have no effect, because as you point out, these methods do not degrade wormholes. however, ccp can create items that would affect them. that is what i am proposing; a new way to affect these variables."
"the only way i could get behind this is if it randomized the collapse of a wh to the extent that after one of the bombs hits it, you have no indication whatsoever on how much mass it takes to close the wh. it could be a frigate, it could be an orca... and anyone using that wh does so at severe peril of it being a one-way trip. personally, i think that the there should be some more ambiguity in wh mechanics, so closing them is a bit more risky.... closing a wh should not be a trivial exercise."
"the best idea i heard so far was a new long range, long cycling, low damage smartbomb on a destroyer ship hull."

"i'm going to point out why you're worthless. here goes:you say that this csm is not responsible for influencing ccp's direction.you say that this csm \"represented their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the game\".i find it interesting that you can be so against the csm and how it gets elected when your position is contradictory. it simply isn't possible for the csm to not be responsible for influencing ccp's direction yet at the same time be doing anything detrimental. you know, since they don't have influence. with what influence do you see them being a detriment?if you're interested in proposing a new election process for the csm, then cool. but if you're trying to take swings at this group and their positions/motives, it's often helpful to do so without having a self defeating argument.also: nope.jpeg.png.bmp.gif.flv.mov.wmv.mp4"
"since you seemingly struggle with reading comprehension (or you need a history lesson) i'll try to help you out:alex, the goon spai/leader csm chair went to stoffer, the goon spai eve developer and basically said: 'brosef, i know you have almost no resources for fis, just give me a supercap nerf, time dilation, and make pos fueling easier and we're good.' and stoffer said 'ya brosef, we shall never again have significant resources for fis, but of course your request will be at the top of the list.'incarna happened.players raged. bitter vets were bitter. csm tried to mollify the playerbase and white knight for ccp to little effect. massive unsubscriptions were massive.ccp watched what the players did and changed direction.crucible, instead of being a horrible expansion with nothing but space barbies and alex's 3 requests filled was a mediocre expansion thrown together in 7 weeks but dedicated to fis because of the summer of rage.now, do you see how csm can 'represent their own selfish narrow interests to the detriment of the game' without causing the 'change in ccp direction' that occurred? great. you're welcome. run along."

"for either $15 or one plex a month you can get three more character slots. as a bonus you can train one of them simultaneously with your main character.problem?"
"from ccp's perspective, it's a bad business decision. why should they let you pay a one time fee to get three more slots when they can charge you $15 a month for it?"
"i am curious...for what purpose would you need more support alts? they cannot be logged in at the same time as your main so...yeah..."
"tones of purposes, cyno lats for alliance for one. botting for one.imagine pi bot, that relogs every few minutes to different char and make those short time programs running read and support: don't mess with our wh's what is your stance on wh stuff?"

"well, since he wishes to purchase this benefit:avg account life is 2 years iirc.$15*24mo= $360$360/3 slots = $120 per slot$120+$50 convienence fee = $170so if ccp charged a one time fee of $175 per slot it would cover the average account life plus those who go over that life. all non-refundable should the account be found to breach the eula.doesnt sound like terrible thing for ccp imo."

"dearest space friends;i believe that we can all agree that forum poster bumblefck has some excellent ideas about how to run an internet message board themed around his favorite game; moreover, i am pretty sure it is a scientifically demonstrable fact that he 80% better at using the forums than you are. yes, i am talking directly to you; no, you cannot have my delicious bacon sandwich. the long and short of the matter is that i feel ccp hf would be better off as a company, and the eve online player base would be better off as a community, were forum user bumblefck to become ccp bumblefck. i honestly don't think anyone who's reading this cares to know my reasoning, because at this point i am pretty much running on a cult of personality; but, lest i be pointed out for making a bad post once in my life, below are a short list of reasons why you should vote to do what i am proposing.frist of all, bumblefck is awesome. i have a pretty good eye for detecting awesome. he is about 20% as awesome as i am, to put it in hard numbers. while that might not sound like a lot, you have to realize the basis for comparison is pretty high. just look at all those space likes, you know what's up because you put them there. i love each and every one of you forever. secondly, bumblefck has some great ideas. i don't know how often the average forum user on eve online actually bothers to read threads<U+FFFD>i am guessing that percentage is horribly low based on how often you see completely irrelevant comments posted to the second or greater page in a thread, the poster having obviously not even read the original post<U+FFFD>but you can take my goonish word of ehonoure when i tell you that i do, in fact, occasionally peruse some words on the internet. to that end, i will personally put my good name at stake and vouch for bumblefck's cool ideas about how to run these forums.lastly, for those of you still paying attention, i will personally promise each and every one of you who up-votes this thread your own shiny and brand-new, goonfleet-certified pre-owned rifter-class minmatar space frigate. at this point, you can't really say that you don't like this initiative without opening the floor for me to ridicule you for being too \"elite pvp\" to care about rifters. of course you want a rifter, it's not like you're one of those miserable tools in pl, right? right? of course you're not. your vote is appreciated!sincerely and with all of my love,~lyris reddit: lyris_nairn skype: lyris.nairn twitter: @lyris_nairn"

"gah, i typed out a nice long post, but the forums lost it. well here was the gist of it.one of the easiest ways to learn and become absorbed into a new game after the tutorial is to find a corp who doesn't mind helping out new players. these are harder to find in eve than in most mmos. a way to alleviate it would be to use a tab in the corp window for rookie friendly corp recruitment. there would need to be policing of these corps, my idea would be to have the ceo apply for rookie friendly status which would be reviewed and accepted/refused by a gm/isd. aura should introduce this feature to the player.this would help integrate the new player into the social aspect of eve. it would provide them with other rookies to play with as well as mentors who could introduce the aspects of eve the tutorials simply can't teach. this also provides a good answer to the question of \"what should i do next,\" that almost every new player asks after completing the tutorials.there are such corps out there already, it just is hard for a new player to find them."
"edit: the point! new and improved bounties, kill rights, and faction warfare... and a way to get there!greetings, its really fun to fight over stuff and blow things up in eve. i am always looking for new and even more fun (and devious) ways to blow things up, or create opportunities to blow things up, or get paid to blow things up. what you will find below is a set of ideas i have been considering for a while regarding combat, loss, and ways to make it more interesting and profitable.steps towards something greaterrecent updates have brought changes that, while seemingly small in scope, have the power to change the fundamental economic drivers of eve online. the first, and perhaps most powerful of these changes was the ship insurance payment changes. insurance reimbursements for lost ships are now paid based on the actual value of materials required to build them. this implies an extremely powerful concept: the isk value of items within eve can be derived and refined into a single clear number based on aggregated market data. this also implies that such a value can be determined for any item sold via the market. simply by tracking the isk value of materials required to build items, the market value of the items themselves, or some combination there of, anything from meta 1 scramblers to a tech 3 cruiser can have a mean isk value. this is a key concept for proposals given further in the essay. the second of these recent changes was the addition of many faction items to the market. the actual isk value of these items has quickly become clearer since their addition. some faction items can still only be bought and sold through contracts. while contracts are perhaps useful for rarer items, common items can be tracked more easily through the market. there is also much more price fluctuation in contracts. multiple items being sold in one contract also makes determining isk value for items with no market equivalent near impossible. as stated above, determining isk value is key. finally, the most recent update has brought the ability to see what implants were lost when <U+FFFD>giving someone a quick trip home<U+FFFD>. this is truly the crownpiece of any aggregated isk value calculation system. we can now know everything lost upon ship and pod destruction and therefore determine down the very last cent (or isk in this case) the value of all assets involved. together i believe these changes warrant a serious rethinking of bounties, kill rights, and factional warfare. an incredible new world of opportunities to enrich the game play experience within eve online lay before us. systems where destruction and loss have clear value, and more importantly, clear rewards are now possible. there are many possibilities <U+FFFD>many more then i can relay here and keep my essay any reasonable length! i will try to hit on a few of them below.bounties that mean something!instead of silly pod destruction empire generated bounties could pay out a percentage of the target<U+FFFD>s assessed losses until the total bounty prize was depleted. players could freely add their own funds to such bounties as they desired. private bounty contracts would not only be possible but desired! two parties, be they single players, corps, or alliances could enter into a contractual agreement where by a third party<U+FFFD>s assets were targeted and destroyed. a percentage value of the destroyed items would be paid out to the aggressors. under such a system payments could only occur for items which were destroyed, not dropped. however attackers would now gain from both drops and destruction. no more cursing the wicked drop fairies because your targets faction modules did not drop! (at least not so profusely) its also interesting to consider pricey <U+FFFD>uninsurables<U+FFFD>, such as t2 ships under such a system. so you finally caught that annoying nano fit vagabond? while he gets 30% of the value of a tech 1 stabber for that loss, you on the other hand are operating under a private bounty agreement and get some portion of the actual value of his t2 hull. lucky you!(continued below)"
"killrightswithin such a system kill rights could be updated to allow destruction of the aggressor<U+FFFD>s assets up to the assessed value of incurred losses. this also begs for a reconsideration of transferrable kill rights. that however is not within the scope of this essay.war declarations revisitedinstead of a flat fee to attack any given corp or alliance, limited destruction rights within empire space could be purchased. mercenary corps could no longer endlessly attack groups of industrialists for a flat weekly fee. at the same time attacks which serve a specific purpose could be executed more freely for considerably less isk. (caveat! i am not supporting one system over another here, just giving some possibilities. troll for life brutha!)faction warfare could be truly profitable!with a more granular loss calculation system in place faction warfare payments could be expanded beyond simple loyalty points. cold, hard isk could also be paid out. this would allow a new income stream in eve for fw participants! it might also help balance out some of the disparities between opposing empires that currently exist. more opposing fw targets would mean more possible profit and more danger!suicide yarr!!! did those guys who just trashed your freighter in high sec with a suicide gank do it for the <U+FFFD>lols<U+FFFD>, or because they were paid off? anyone really dislike you? did they put a private bounty contract on you or your corporation? you may never know. i like to imagine this as a nice replacement for the recently lost insurance payments when suicide ganking. as you can see there are many possibilities. i believe the examples given above only scratch the surface. the key to all of this is an aggregated market evaluation system capable of giving an arbitrary value to each and every item bought and sold.the value of conflict the goal here is to create a war economy: a system where destruction and conflict have value -not only an immediate value, but a speculative one as well. conflict is what drives eve online and makes it the engaging experience we all love. i believe such a system would give players the tools to fight with one another in new rich and robust ways. it would give us new excuses to blow up important internet spaceships. and most important, it would be fun."
"no. because,1. as you said, there are much better things to spend dev zots on.2. characters wis cannot do anything so excitedly that it would cause boobs to bounce anyway.3. the fact this is given attention by you paints you as being overly sexually motivated and perverted. if ccp implemented it, it would cause them to also appear so, and reflect badly on them and us as a community. we already get flak for being 95% male, we would become a laughing stock.4. if your character is wearing a bra - and we know from the character creator she definitely is - her boobs would not bounce anyway, unless they were of a monstrous size. and even then only slightly. so slightly that any development time would be clearly wasted.the only exception to all this, and the only time i'd agree with your request, is if ccp introduced strippers like we saw in the teaser incarna footage a while back. however if that were the case, i am certain ccp would give the strippers realistic boobs regardless of your perverted assembly hall posts you disgusting old man ugh"

"speaking from a wormspace dweller perspective, where most fights are small gang size and a single capship present on field is a very big deal:capital ship self destruct with no lossmail encourages blobbing and discourages evenly-matched fun fights.if you have an epic fight where one side squeaks out a win by the narrowest of margins, then any enemy capships present on the losing side will have more than enough time to see the fight is lost and hit that one button to cover up the record of their loss. which means such an epic fight is less likely to happen, as the potentially winning side will want to bring five times as many ships as is necessary to win, so that they can crush that capship in under 120 seconds from when they appear on d-scan. barely squeaking by with minimal force and taking out a capship is the fight you talk about for months afterward. splattering a capship who had no chance in less than 120 seconds is not.yes please to some kind of record for self destruct under fire for capships. yes please to more incentive to start evenly-matched nailbiter fights."

"ccp can't do anything about keyloggers that you let get installed on your system. no matter what, there is nothing they can do about it. a keylogger with sufficient information can also take over your e-mail account too, so e-mail verification won't fix the issue either. nothing beyond a hardware solution, like yubikey, can prevent keyloggers from gaining access to your account.keyloggers aren't ccp's fault and they can't do anything about it. maybe their reimbursement policies aren't all they could be, but there wouldn't be an issue in the first place if you just kept your computer secure."
"i have multiple firewalls on my machine. but that's not the point. thing is, the keylogger logging in from another ip than mine should be sending some sort of a flag to ccp that the account should be shut down, which would have prevented anything from being stolen. sure, they'd get into my email, but i would know what's happening and i wouldn't lose anything in eve.i'm not saying this is \"the\" solution, just that there are solutions that can and should be explored. are you really telling me that ccp shouldn't examine the situation? and can you really justify your own apathy with the excuse that my computer was insecure for the first time in 14 years?-jm"
"why, might i ask?you mean some kind of verification like facebook's \"someone logged in from this location\" system? not a bad idea, but probably a pain to implement. remember, you are speaking about a company that won't even build a kill board for it's own game.not that i'm bashing ccp, but i'd hazard a guess that the number of people effected by keyloggers is relatively low. i'd also guess the number of people unsatisfied after having been attacked, and who blame ccp, is even lower. the question is, would the resources required to create such a system be better served elsewhere?i also happen to agree with their current stance on protecting the eve economy, your computer security is your own concern, unless the attack was server side you are at fault, no matter how unlucky you may have been.it is not ccp's responsibility to completely reimburse you with in game assets for a security flaw on your own system, especially not at the expense of endangering the game economy.it sucks that you somehow got a keylogger onto your machine, however it happened, but personally i'd prefer to not see items duplicated on the eve server because of other people's issues with account security.as for your claim that it benefits isk sellers, it would strike me as dumb and overly complicated to sell the items to their own accounts and try to spider web the money back to some clean source. a more likely scenario is that they just sold your stuff for as much isk as they could, as quickly as they could. then purchased a small number of very expensive items and tried to drop them in space, or otherwise move them to other characters, without any transactions being logged.anyway, all of that's blind speculation, at the end of the day your computer was compromised. ccp helped to the best of their ability without completely destroying the eve economy, and i'm sure they try pretty damn hard to find the people behind this kind of thing too. that seems like enough to me.[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"so if i bring my laptop to an another home or isp and my account gets flagged for stolen account.yeah...that will work just grand.maybe you should take a little responsibility for yourself and accept that fact you likely got phished.================ stop the evemail spam!"

"honestly, i'd be happy to answer your questions about my personal situation, but that's not why i made this thread. if you want to ask about my personal security situation, create a new thread in the appropriate section of the forum, link it, and we'll talk there.in the meantime, it sounds like nobody has any objections to my main proposal, that ccp examine their \"policy\", except that it would actually be work for ccp. moreover, the way the current system works, isk scammers are making isk by violating the eula and the fraud laws of most nations on earth. by addressing questions of personal responsibility, you are avoiding discussion of the topic at hand, which is simply that ccp can and should examine how they do business in this regard.it seems like ccp doesn't care how we go about getting back stolen property or reporting criminals to the authorities. in other words, the current policy by ccp says it's fair game for me to go about becoming an isk-seller myself in order to recoup my losses. obviously, i'm not going to, but that sort of opening is disturbing.-jm"
"well, i (and most people i guess) am still trying to figure out how you get to isk sellers and scammers from a keylogger."
"no, personal responsibility is entirely what this topic is about. ccp's handling of the consequences after the fact is fine, and needs no examination. that's the part you seem to be refusing to accept. the fact that you immediately brought up isk sellers tells me more about your situation than the block of :words: you posted in post #1. you, and everyone else that has been \"hacked\" through a keylogger, only have yourselves to blame for what happens. the fact that ccp gives you back anything at all should be seen as charity.and as for flagging accounts that log in from multiple ips.. you're really grasping at straws to blame anyone else but yourself, aren't you?"
"if you are correct, why am i posting a proposal that ccp examine its policy and security procedures? if i was wanting my stuff back, that's what this post would be about, and you wouldn't find it here in the csm forums. the fact is, this is not about me. it's about the game and asking for the same fairness in game that we get under our common law.i have already accepted what i've lost. now i'm trying to push for change in ccp so what happened to me doesn't happen to others. i'm not saying \"force this on everyone\" but rather \"give us the option to choose\". what is wrong with your head that you are so vehemently against a request for a few simple security options?according to the eula section 2a paragraph 3, \"you may not share your account with anyone, or allow anyone other than you personally (or your minor child, if you have registered an account on behalf of your minor child) to access or use your account. joint or shared ownership or use of an account by more than one user is prohibited.\" logging in from multiple ips would indicate a violation of the eula, no?the concept of flagging accounts that log in from unrelated ips several times in succession is one option not \"the solution\". there are many other security options ccp could investigate if the company really wants to stop isk scammers.don't you think it's bullcrap that ccp will write complex code to prevent me from choosing whatever password i want and additional code forcing me to type the name of a character on the account; however, they think it's too much work to write code to enable me the option of preventing others from changing the password or changing my email address without further security information?please, stop defending ccp's poor customer service record and lackluster security.-jm"
"well, i've logged on with four+ different ips over the course of the same day, me personally, not sharing the account or anything like that. that's a horrible criteria for determining if the account has been hacked.also, the code for checking passwords to make sure they fit some criteria is trivially simple (if (len(pw)<8) | str.isalpha(pw) | str.isdigit(pw): self.throwbadpwerror(); break). and if you follow proper security procedures to begin with, no one will ever be able to change your password or e-mail in the first place.and this isn't at all about ccp's security at all, their security is fine, this is about your security (or lack thereof) and you letting someone know your password (even if you didn't intend to).tl;dr: ccp can't fix stupid and they can't stop you from letting someone know your password."
"i would actually like to see a new cov-ops ship type built specifically for solo and small raiding and pirate gangs that has way more gank potential, but cannot fit a cyno. that way you would be able to eliminate the possibility of a cyno if you know it's one these new ships in your system and raiders get a ship that doesn't lack for tank (bombers) or dps (force recons). would that satisfy you, or is what you really want 100% safe nullsec space in which to pve?"
"you beat me to it!it is rather annoying when you go looking for a fight and they all just dock up because they know that they cannot win.to bad there isn't a way to maintain a persistant presence in that system so that one could wait for a good ambush...truth is that i don't like afk cloaking as much as the ones i'm afk cloaking, it's boring. drop local and make everyone happymmos come and go, but eve remains. -garresh-"
"look at my corp and alliance.......does it look like i engage in pve at all?"

"afk cloaking is no threat to anyone any more than a ship sitting in a pos shield with no pilot.here's a compromise:the lowest level cloaking device is a \"prototype\". this would indicate that it's not a final product which is polished and working smoothly. maybe the prototype cloaking device i and ii should have a percentage chance of failing once in a while.this would limit afk cloaking to ships that can fit the covert-ops cloaks, but still allow for afk cloaking."

"a specialized character doesn't need much skill point to be effective. as eve online gets older so do the characters...yet there isn't a need to keep training the characters because they are maxed out at what they do. so the answer is to open more slots per account to grow that way. i am getting to the point on my accounts where i have nothing left to train on the 3 characters i have on my accounts. i have carrier pilots who depend on my cyno/etc alt to log into the game and enable them to move. all my characters are cyno-enabled. every character i have can cyno. yet the 3 characters i have are committed to a different part of eve. i'm not concerned about training multiple characters on an account. i'm the type of person that wants to have a couple characters in high sec/ wormholes/ 0.0/ etc. i'm not changing the way the next person plays their game. when you have a character(s) in a high/low/0.0/wormhole corp, you are devoted to that corp and can't go from 0.0 to high sec because of commitments to you're corp/alliance. eventually this will happen, eventually you're eve characters, all 3 of them will become so proficient at what they do that you won't have a need to train them. there are people who will train that 1 main character to 300 million skill points, but i'd rather have (3) 100 million skillpoint characters, after which i'd like more character slots that allow me more access to the game. i feel each character on an account allows more access to the game. makes my game experience better."

"there's an easy and cheap solution to account security .... ccp could develop a smartphone app that would register your phone to your account. anytime you log in from a new ip#/new pc/etc., the game client could require an extra layer of authentication - a code from your smartphone app. the app could use timestamp + phone mac # or some other identifier, to generate the smartphone authentication code. so, when prompted by the client for the extra code, you simply pull out your phone, generate a new code, enter it, and off you go. key loggers wouldn't be able to generate spoofed keys, b/c they would need your smarphone and the time-based algorithm to do so.all of this would likely take ccp's skilled programmers only a matter of a couple of weeks to develop (do android, iphone, and windows phone versions). there are tons of ways it could be tweaked to address various concerns."
"that wasn't my proposal at all. first and foremost, my proposal is that ccp just take a look at the entire situation and try to plug the holes where isk sellers make profit.secondly, under my specific recommendation about ips; in your case, you would be able to log each of those ips so that if somebody does try to log in from another one, it would be blocked. but that's a side issue, not my overall point.player stupidity is off topic. make a new thread.-jm"

"so you want to completely negate the risk of closing wormholes? no."
"first things first. i usually don't respond to posts by random throwaway alts in noob corps. man up and post on a main.that being said i actually do agree with you about docking up or logging off. it's annoying to corner an enemy fleet in a dead end only to have them log off and escape. it's also annoying to be swarming around someone's home system and see people talking smack in local from the safety of a station. i know there are certain game mechanics that you just can't get around but i don't think anyone or any thing should ever be 100% safe in eve, that's the problem i have with the cloaking device.also i don't get why getting rid of local would help the situation at all. it would make afk cloaking more effective not less effective. problem: \"there is some dude hiding outside my apartment building. he's been stabbing people for the last two weeks, nobody can chase him down because he's an invisible wizard or something. i don't want to go outside because i'll get stabbed without being able to catch him. and he has the power to teleport a load of other knife wielding dudes on top of himself.\"solution: \"lets make him more difficult to detect so you don't know he is out there.\"basically you show up in someone's ratting system in your covops. you immediately cloak so you don't show up on d-scan. then you just poke your own d-scan every few hours or so (whenever you are at your computer) looking for ratters.then you have all your cap pilots and black ops pilots in your alliance in one chat channel along with you so you have them on call when you find something worth jumping. then you point your target, cyno in a gank fleet, blow them up, and gtfo.on the defending side the only counter to this is to have a home defense fleet already made and protecting your ratter /miner so that when the blob shows up you can fight it. this means you have 1 person in a ratting battleship actually doing some ratting while 20 people in pvp ships sit bored out of their skull protecting one dude from a theoretical hot drop.now the most annoying part of this is that the cloaky guy in local will only start at fight that he knows his side can absolutely win. so if you have a 20 man ratting babysitter fleet hovering in space the cloaky will only jump you if he can get 40 dudes for a black ops drop, or enough carriers and supers to kill your little gang. so the home defense gang knows that the only way this evening will end is either by staring at one dude running havens all night or by getting out blobbed and blowing up.we keep going on about risk vs. reward and balance issues in eve. i just think that the way cloaking devices are now they make gameplay unbalanced. also the most effective use of cloaking devices makes gameplay that just isn't very fun.for the afk cloaker it's not exciting gameplay at all, you just log on and poke your computer every once in a while, it's probably more boring than checking facebook. for the people doing the hot dropping it's not really a kill you can be proud of. congratulations you got in a bomber, took a jump portal, and fired at some random battleship that you absolutely know is going to blow up along with 20 other dudes. and for the defenders it's really annoying because you'll either get blue balled or out blobbed.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"what's the big deal, you say? they're only pixels. only pixels?well, you're correct. however, i find eve online's lack of beards disturbing. i myself wield a mighty beard oop and desire... no, demand, that more beards are added to the game for player character models. i'm not talking about the generically cut and short variants as seen amongst new eden.who would want their pc to sport an epic viking-esque beard or evil looking long goatee? something that players can see in the system chat and tell right away that this guy will, in all probability, blow your ship to pieces before ransoming your pod and killing your clone outright anyway. or perhaps complement the respectable look of an experienced trader grizzled in the ways of interstellar travel... or add a bit of obnoxious flair to the booster addict trolling in jita.in the end, simple idea. i know that there are certainly more important things that need attention to these days, but a bearded man can dream. what says the community?"

"if you enjoy agent running, or hunt npc, or do any kind of fun pve activity in eve, your faction standings are changing. eventually you'll get to the point, that doing one more mission will drop your standings to some empire faction less than -5, and you will have some issues flying in a vast part of empire space. in case of hunting npc on belts in 0.0, you'll end up with almost no chance to switch to 0.0 agents, if you may ever want it to do. proposal:every faction should have a kind of a temporary pass-card to their territory in their lp stores (like starbase charters) costs some lp and some isk (we need more isk sinks, right?). when you use that pass-card, you'll temporary rise your standings to that faction for a 24 hours, after that your standings are dropped to the previous level. the amount of standing to rise is a topic to discuss, it can also depend on a price of a pass-card. p.s. don't forget to click \"like\" if you like"

"eve needs the opposite of what your asking for, standings that actually mean something. have real benefits and consequences and can't easily be changed."
"you're doing it wrong then. there are many other ways to fix your standings that aren't just grinding lvl 4s for half a year."

"supported, and look at all these shitposting alts."
"what? lol...stupid statement is stupid."
"problem is that all that accomplishes is roll back eve to pre-t3 times and probably make cs even more of an unused class .. it will in fact probably be worse than pre-t3 as the multi-link cs are a lot easier to probe out than the t3 ditto .. the concept of being able to directly influence the performance of <250 people at once has always been broken, t3's abuse just pushed it into the open, the only \"feature\" that historically even comes close to that kind of power was deliberately crashing a node.in short: if anything, an off-grid booster should be operating at a significantly reduced capacity as opposed to when being on-grid - as in half strength .. makes it a conscious choice to opt for the slight but 'hidden' edge rather than the full monty. they don't necessarily have to become insta-gibbed when moved on-grid, that only applies if it is done with nothing further changed:- when the cs are revised (which they have to, way outdated) the field commands should be given 2 free links slots (up from 1), the fleet commands unlimited (up from 3, no command procs needed) and they should both get tank boost as well as a signature reduction.- t3 command subsystems should have their link allowance doubled (2 'native' rather than 1) and the tanking bonuses increased, could be a sig decrease or maybe even an +% incoming rr.once people learn that the 6-link hull is kind of useless, links will be spread out onto multiple hulls to minimize the risk of being completely stripped .. goddess knows there are enough bc's floating around these days to pick up any slack that might appear.add a revision to fleet window where the commander (or assigned role) can list all available links in fleet and change boosters on the fly .. will have to sort out the shield crap first if rapid switches is to be viable for all though."
"this is great, have my bump.edit: read through the thread, here are a couple points i think need to be answered (quotes are paraphrased but accurate)who cares? this isn't about changing where pvp happens. this is about making low-sec not ****. if consequentially more people pvp in low-sec, so be it.false. club bear is a good counterexample. plus, you're basing your experience on what you see in low-sec, which is a bit myopic seeing as the people this would apply to avoid low-sec in its current state due to being limited to flashies.where x is some form of grinding. alts, hauling, scouring the stocks of the low-sec market, ratting sec from time to time. it's all some form of grinding. we're aware that it's possible to do that, we just don't like it, hence the op. just stating what the game is like atm and going \"deal with it\" isn't constructive.the crux of the issue.you're misconstruing eve's harshness into a stone-wall \"want to make eve quote unquote easier, more accessible? baby, go play hello kitty online / wow / cowadooty\".op wants to change the way in which low-sec is harsh, not remove the harshness. instead of stupid mechanics and grinding, lack of sentries and player-caused danger. if you think this is against eve's philosophy, then you think eve is about grinding, and you're the one who should be playing wow. not arena though, just leveling blacksmithing all day.btw, even for all the die-hard grindfest fans, at least acknowledge the stupidity of sec status making low-sec further removed from high-sec than 0.0 is.oh and jack, don't think i don't know whom you're talking about when you say \"people complaining about not having ship fittings even when we had corp hulls\"."
"agreed."
"lowsec also pretty much alienates frigates, assault frigates, destroyers, interdictors and t1 cruisers from effectively engaging on gates.this added to the fact that newbies often want to go play in a rifter compounds eve's elitist playstyle. essentially, solo lowsec pvp under bc hulls is incredibly hard to find, unless you want to be roundly spanked by alex medvedov in a 2/10 plex, get jumped by six drams in amamake i belt i or be ganked by an instalock lachesis tackle for a battlecruiser gang.when i was a 2m sp nubbing back in 2008 or whenever it was i would have loved to jump in a rifter and tour lowsec trying my hand at nabbing a cruiser or destroyer at a gate, or even grabbing an industrial. it would have pushed me into true piracy a lot quicker.this suggestion is still one of the best ive seen for a while, even if it was a corpmate who suggested it./me tips his hat to mr. dant"

"i always liked the 'implant' portion of the game.even more so now that a pod kill shows the expensive implants you have popped."
"i'm mixed on this topic. attribute implants make up a decent part of the eve market. i'm not sure just ripping it out is a good idea. would all the attribute implants i own just vanish with no reimbursment?but there is definitely a problem with people not wanting to go into null sec because of bubbles.what if you could warp your pod out of a bubble? the risk in null sec would be the same as the risk in low sec/high sec. it seems less drastic than making all these implants go out of existance and changing several others that include this bonus.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"pods would make nearly unstoppable scouts - probably not a good thing."
"less so about this than about getting more folks involved.i'll give you a funny point to look at.\"back in the day, we used to get up at 3am to adjust our queue for training!\" - ever read these kinds of posts?guess what - there is a portion of this community that the only way in hell they are up at 3am is if it's feeding time and no, that isn't from smoking a bowl and getting the muchies.that \"real life\" portion also cannot guarantee they can be online every day to jump clone around nor are they very good at pvp due to lack of time to invest in playing. they know it - most of those \"more dedicated\" players know it too. in general, they don't mind this but will only risk what they can afford to lose at each outing.2006 - the average online time for eve players is 17 hours a week. that's a part time job.so if you have those with \"real lives\" that play eve, who may spend 17 hours a month in the game, that average means there are a lot who are spending vastly more time in it.these \"vastly more\" types are the ones that seem to post sneers all over. they figure they are the \"normal eve player\" - which may be true nowadays but if you ever want the game to grow, i'd advise players start looking at those more casual types as where to focus for growth - not your \"10 accounts, 16 hours a day in eve\" players - which seem to the the ones all these penalty discussions are aimed at.when you are cranking in tens of billions a month from your alts, and insist that others pay the penalties as if they were; only those who also are doing that can participate. the rest ... don't even bother trying it - those portions of the game aren't designed for them so they should just stay out of it - which they tend to do. the \"alt army\" is, again, a rather thinner layer of the gaming community than those who spend far less time \"playing\".so making things more accessible - enabling folks to follow the golden rule of eve - \"don't fly what you cannot afford to lose\" but aiming those losses farther down the income chain, to encourage more player involvement... yeah i kind of like the idea but i'm confused as hell seeing it coming from andski.you see i've seen him chatting in eve - this guy loves being involved in things like hulkageddon laughing about how those \"bot pilot\" tears are so great - except, last time i checked, bot pilots weren't around their keyboard to whine when they were blown up ... be that as it may - he has been a proponent of more griefing of anyone who plays this game than most i've seen. he's about as far from \"nullbear\" as you'll get and has a bunch of accounts to fund his pvp.i saw this thread and the first thing that went through my head was \"the second post has to be his alt. he's trolling here...\" because that post sounded more like him than his suggestion. when he says losses like this don't bother him, he's being honest. it's the mitigation of any pvp penalties that just doesn't make sense - that just doesn't sound like him./boggle"
"aren't cov ops already nearly unstoppable? with the ability to cloak and scan they would still seem to be a better choice than a pod. comparing that to increasing everyone's attributes by 5 points, taking valuable assets from players with no reimbursment, and demolishing what is left of already almost useless lp stores, it seems a relatively minor disadvantage.plus allowing pods to warp out of bubbles would lead to more people buying implants and actually make the economy more robust instead of eliminating a large part of it. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"i'm going to rephrase this so that applies to the actual situation better. instead of using the random backally stabber, imagine a sniper with a laser to drop bombs on a target. thats the potential of afk cloaking. the threat of force is really what keeps locals in sov docked up, not the actual use of force.afk cloaking is a very basic form of unconventional warfare, something that has been around for 1000's of years.psychologically it takes a toll on the people in area, the base populace that generated the resources and income to perpetuate warfare.this type of warfare is generally used to make the enemy so paranoid and scared that they'll expend a great deal of resources to expel a threat that might not even be there. think about random mortaring and sniper fire, the attackers in an urban environment have th benefit of being able to disappear into crowds and it takes a great amount of resources to weed them out. in a rural environment this is different, sniper attacks could claim a single life and overtime a single smart sniper could whittle down the personal and moral of an entire brigade.sun tzu referenced this as a war at home, the population has to either want the war or not care about the war in order to maintain a strategic advantage and maintain moral in the ranks. this tactic has been used countless times in history to break the backs of nations and has ended in complete victory for a weaker player. in eve this very basic principle is replicated in the form of being able to keep pilots logging on. seeing an empty teamspeak because everyone is afk because of a hostile in system causes you to not want to play. once activity dies down then space is vulnerable. this is a legitimate part of warfare in eve, this is not going to change.either htfu and patrol your space, or go back to highsec and let npc's do it for you.mmos come and go, but eve remains. -garresh-"
"personaly i think the decloaking thing is a bad ideal. it weakens the cloak to much for it's real intented perposses.how ever i would fully support a new state of the art scaning prob that can only scan down cloaked ships and with perfect skills and ship and hardwiring would take at least 20mins to scan down.that 20 mins is more then whats needed to gtfo cloak up and log out or put a cryo up. or actively fly around cloaked from safe spot to safe spot but req's you to be at pc at least only kind of afk like ice mining.it how ever will not let you sit there 24/7 and be online at the same time.edit: and i only say that becouse real life spys have to work damn hard at stealing intel and so should the afk cloakers in any allance system or wh.that way they have to at least be at the pc playing to gain what ever there goals are for siting in that system."
"ok yeah that's a good point. going into someone else's space to mess with their heads is a valid tactic.... says the guy in the npc corp.but there needs to be some sort of counter to this. once someone gets in their target system, safes up, and cloaks there is literally nothing you can do to track them down. they can just log in day after day cloaking up as soon as they hit grid.i think that the defenders should have an option available tot hem to try and fight back. and don't say 23/7 gate camps on your home system try try and catch cloakies. yes it's the only defense against this sort of thing right now, but that is way to disproportionate an amount of effort that the defenders need to invest versus one guy trying to slip a cloaked ship in system.the two solutions i think would work are either giving cloaked ships an incredibly small signature radius that is difficult to probe out. or giving cloaking devices a 2-3 hour fuel bay so they'd need to gas up every once in a while.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"+1 on the fuel bay but limit it to 1 hour max. cov ops cloaks are not intended to unbalance the game. 1 hour is plenty of time on a cloak that you only need occasionally. they are intended for spying/scouting. not making up for a loser corp incapable of p"

(damage included or not depends on technical problems i presume) no loot drops pay out no insurance this way sd is used for the primary reason it should be used: denying people your stuff. it doesn't however cover the fact that your ship was destroyed.also the timer should be dependant on the ships size. the timer should be that it forces people to use enough dps to be able to kill it. a reasonable timer would probably be around 5-6 minutes for a super. a pod could be lowered to 20-30 seconds.conclusion:the csm has recommended this once already, but nothing happened with it then. ccp is doing a good job fixing a lot of \"issues\" with the game, let's make this the next one?this issue was alrdy raised once by alekseyev karrde, 20 december 2009.the minutes it was discussed in: csm meeting 4.002 // meeting minutes: 2009/12/20 18:18 results were:self destruct should revoke insurancepassed 7/2 (mrs trzzbk, korvin)self-destruct should generate killmailpassed 7/2 (teadaze, song li)self-destruct should \"overheat\" all modulesfailed 7/2 (alekseyev karrde, sokratesz)self-destruct timer depends on ship sizepassed 8/1 (korvin)i dont mind this changes myself.but there is a point of conflict in my mind of the no pay out on insurance.it makes perfect logic that a insurance company will not pay out if you destory your own ship. but that same logic also means no more pay outs if the police blow your crap up too."

"ok, i get it, you want to see more about wis. you want to sit and spend 2 hours per day doing things that has no meaning (within the confines of the game world). that's cool with me, but before you go flipping out that they don't care about you anymore because they went back to their core game (fis) ... you've got to look at the bigger picture.you're 3 years old. assuming you've played that whole time, you've sat through the \"18 months\" and \"excellence\" things from ccp, and have accepted the lacklustre expansions over that time with the rest of us. incarna was a really bad expansion overall -- ccp nearly killed the relationship with their core demographic. they've said nearly as much in the recent devblogs, and the crucible trailer itself. crucible is fixing a lot of the issues -- pcu the last two weekends has been at 50k or better for the first time since incarna. no, crucible has not fixed all the problems in eve, nor will the next expansion ... but if ccp keeps with their \"back to basics\" stance, the game as a whole will get significantly better with time. seriously -- crucible was a great expansion that was practically thrown together in a few weeks. look at what they were able to achieve, and apply that to what they can pull off for the next expansion.sure, wis will get the \"and oh yeah, we were able to throw this in too\" treatment for a while, but better that than \"sorry guys, we can't keep tq online. it was a great run, maybe we'll see you in perpetuum or something.\""
"^ no one is suggesting that ccp shouldn't work on the fis stuff, we just want to know if wis will be expanded on in the near future as the concept for it is what made a lot of newer ppl sign up to this game.ps. this is not a discussion, it's a request for csm to get us some answers."

"ok so when ccp put out the new customs offices they said they readjusted the base tax amount from november averages. they did this because the old market value was out of date and far too low.after this announcement and some carebear tears the market value of pi shot up again, but the taxes are still based off the old november rate.the base market value used to calculate pi taxes needs to be automatically updated on a regular basis.during downtime every night an extra routine could be added to the downtime upkeep programs to pull average buy and sell prices for each individual pi material to set the next day's taxes.so if construction blocks are going for 5000 a unit on average at downtime. then the next day a 10% tax on construction blocks should be 500.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"i believe that you have the foundation of the paradigm correct, but your conclusion is incorrect.you are right in that it is ludicrously expensive and inefficient. taking down a wormhole 1 kg at a time is silly, even if the bombs were free. your average wormhole has about a billion available mass. can you imagine how long it would take you to fire a billion of these at a hole? i did the math; using a bomb launcher ii, and firing every 135 seconds without any pause it would take you over 4,280 years to close the hole. if you have 10,000 friends to help you, you could all bang it out in 156 days. you and i agree on this so far. there are cheaper, faster and more efficient ways to degrade a wormhole. yet for some reason you are reticent to take the next step and agree that a 1kg device would not break the game. perhaps you view such an admission as a camel's nose under the tent?"

"funny thing that is what they always say and ccp will no longer provide this data at least openly to the player base. were pushing 2012 right around the corner and i would bet the bank they dont add that stat into the qen anymore. they realy dont want to see the trueth of just how many players spend the majority of there time in high sec. if they keep releasing that data on every qen and it holds at around that % or higher then the hardcore players would be hard pressed to defend there crap. ccp know's were most of the players spend most of there time. they just dont wish to say it out loud like in that qen.how ever if you wish to take your own snap shots all you have to do is.1.) hit your f10 key and select the tab labeled stars.2.) open your statistics folder.3.) select the option called \"averge pilots in space in the last 30 minutes\".spend the time doing that every time you log in and right before you go to log out. then tell me were the over whelming majority of players spend there time in space in eve.answer: high secedit: on the other hand that is only pilots in space in the last 30mins so mybe all of low/null and npc null realy like spending there time always docked up? could the be the real push for incarna? ccp belives there low/null and npc null players realy realy like there station time and there for they wish to improve it for them? i just dont know."
"the stats that show nearly 80% of characters (not players) in highsec seems to make some believe that is justification for and an endorsement by players actions for a further push to risk free pve, consensual pvp, and other themepark-ish mechanics. however, the assumption is wrong.most players assess their actions and behaviors on what's most rewarding, where can the most can be gained for the least effort and risk, where the action is, and what is most fun. eve is also a game where a large portion of players have multiple accounts, never mind multiple characters.it isn't that 80% of players would rather play under the protection of concord in highsec, but if that's the easiest and safest way for them to make isk you can be sure that's where they will be, if not with their main, which they have fun with in null or low sec, then with alt characters. just because you make the most a situation, does not mean you endorse that status quo.then with most of the miners and pveing characters etc in highsec so too come the pirates and predatory type pvpers. i don't mean to insult anyone but the empire wardecers and other similar types are the real pirates of eve, at least as traditionally a pirate or privateer is thought of as being. lowsec guys are more like gangs of road warriors from mad max, they even live in a wasteland.all of which point to the 80% figure indicating a serious unbalanced situation in eve, not in that everyone wants highsec 'space wow', but rather the risk vs reward is totally off in eve. either non consensual pvp needs to be brought back full force to highsec (pre p alliance wardec nerf), or all the major sources of isk and minerals need to leave highsec."
"as part of an overall campaign to improve risk-reward across eve, i would like to see player-protection/revenge services (i.e., concord) get revamped. instead of being a mandatory purchased paid for by taxes, i would like to see it be optional. that is, concord would offer protection services to players in hi-sec systems on a subscription basis, with the price of the subscription being determined by the lowest security level being covered by the subscription (e.g., buying protection for 0.5 systems costs more than buying protection for 1.0 systems) and by the sec-status of the pilot being covered (covering lower-security pilots costs more). pilots could also forgo subscribing to concord, which would leave them open to attack, even though they might be located in hi-sec. new players would receive an automatic subscription for some period. protected vs. unprotected players could be distinguished via overview settings. a kind of tweaked bounty/contract system would allow player-groups to basically compete with concord in hi-sec (perhaps offering lower prices for not-so-guaranteed or swift revenge) and maybe even provide this service in low-sec, possibly making it more accessible to a greater range of pilots (for a price). another possibility would be to have the overview icon distinguishing protected and unprotected work on a color gradient: observers could distinguish between players protected by highly effective providers, those protected by not-so-effective providers, and those with no protection whatsoever. within hi-sec, pilots would have the option of choosing between various qualities and prices of protection: concord would be the high-priced gold-standard, and various player groups could offer protection of a quality somewhere between that and nothing. those choosing to go without protection would have lower operating costs, but would be at a greater risk of being attacked."

"first off, i'm really happy about the new corp location system. being able to distribute system bookmarks in w-space without copying bm's into cans is awesome.however, with the current \"randomized\" delay it is a horrible pain in the arse to collaborate on system scanning because the unpredictability of when the bm's actually show up in corp locations.typically a ts convo between our scouts goes like this:18:30 scout 1 : added k162 bm to new wh folder.18:32 scout 2 : i got a c5 wh here, where is that bm folder i don't see it18:32 random corp guy: well i can see that folder its there.18:32 scout 2 : [insert random profanity] k warp to me for c5 bm i will put it in corp locations once the folder shows...this will continue on and on and the more people scouting the more annoying it gets because the new items show up for some people, but not for all.if you want to implement delayed corp locations, then fine, but make sure that the information provided is consistently the same for everyone."

"+1 supported.i agree with the idea that cs should be on grid"
"i have to say that i find off grid boosting lame (even though i enjoy will adama's pvp videos and the fact that he doesn't hide that he uses off grid t3 gang links). the boosts that these ships give are clearly profound and to be able to use them in relative safety is baad mmkay. @people who say you can't fit these ships for on grid boosting without utterly gimping them; get a life and adapt your fitting. it's very easy. remember only fleet command ships are supposed to be able to use three gang links simultaneously efficiently. not t3's.to that end:i support the idea of \"on grid fleet boosting\". +1however i believe that off grid boosting should also be possible but at a heavily reduced effectiveness. 50% or even 75% less effective as on grid boosting."
"in a fleet fight, you can destroy your enemies damage dealers, logistics, ewarfare, dictors/hictors, tacklers, etc.you should be able to destroy your enemies fleet boosters as well. destroying a fleet booster means removing enhanced abilities that may be affecting the entire enemy fleet, thus possibly improving your odds in a fight.the concept of safespotted t3 with ganglinks running during a fight with cov ops/interdiction nullifier to move around unchecked is beyond terrible."
"no. sentries are part of what keeps lowsec sane. if you want to camp a lowsec gate, you need either a gang that can tank sentries among them, or a dedicated ship that's likely to die if someone actually fights back. either way, you are a target for other people around you.if you remove sentries, it will be interceptors or bombers with falcon support as far as the eye can see. i want to encourage lowsec pvp, not make it more lame.you could adjust flagging mechanics to reduce sentry effects on gang pvp. for example, if you shoot a flashy, you could get a \"global anti-criminal flag\" and lose sentry protection for 15 minutes: \"you have taken the law into your own hands, the police can't help you now\".but that would be a different topic.what happens in lowsec, stays in lowsec, lowering the barrier to entry to lowsec pvp:"
"on one hand, it's about choice. you can put a +5 set and go pvp (theoretically) or you can stay docked, or you can just not use a +5 set at all and go anywhere, anytime you want. it is probably to give players some choices that those learning implants where implemented in the first place.on the other hand, when most players see themselves required to choose always the same option, then the \"choice\" became illusory and that option became for all purposes a mandatory one.sometimes i wonder if the struggle, while the most apparent, is in fact just the second most important feature of the game. apparently, a lot of players considers that progression, their sacred skill training, comes first.i acknowledge the problem. people should not see themselves excluded from the multiplayer aspects of the game because this kind of stupid reasons. i'm just not so certain what the best solution is.:sand: over :awesome:"
"the solution to goon risk aversion? well, it is clearly to remove risk from eve."

"an often heard complaint is that the risk/reward of manufacturing in low/null/wormholes compared to hi-sec is off.i'm not going type a wall of text on the issue going into that specific subject as it's been debated at length in many threads already.it just occurred to me after the introduction of poco's that it could probably be easily fixed by taxing manufacturing slots in a similar way.slam 17% tax based on an item value (of what ever you produce) controlled by ccp on hi-sec station manufacturing slots and make this tax lower as security status slides down.for example; hisec station; 17%lowsec station; 10%npc nullsec; 5%sov nullsec; % controlled by station owner.doing something like this you would actually make it possible for industrialists in more lawless space to produce cheaper making it worthwhile to do so."
"base costs everywhere should also vary by the demand for slots, so that manufacturing slots in busy hi-sec areas should cost a lot more than slots in quiet npc null stations. again pc owners of relevant structures should be able to set their own pricing - at varying rates according to standing (like with pocos.)"
"ok, so you throw a [s|m|l]saa into a pos to skip the tax?if yes, then ccp fix the goddamn pos first"
"yes a pos being owned by you, obviously wouldn't get taxed. but that's ok as pos'es carry risk, they can be destroyed.my gripe, and that of many other non hi-security industrialists, is that despite the extra risk and effort we put in we gain no competitive advantage really.currently producing in lowsec or nullsec tends to cost more then simply building in hi-sec and shipping finished product. introducing a tax/supply demand (for slots) mechanism would largely correct this."
"1.0"
"i would just like to say that i fully endorse many of the ideas in this thread as well as this one:"
"i would have to agree, having something much larger and grander would be great. i wouldn't mind going on hunts. however, with how it stands there isn't much epic feeling to it. by adding a bit more and taking some care to this part of the game would add more action for players to jump on. i think jesse hit it on the head when it comes to the bounty hunting in this game."
"yes, i am specifically asking for clarification on ccps vague and contradictory comments, and details on what to expect in the next 12 months.there is no need for the anti-everything-that-isn't-flying-in-space crowd to get their knickers in a twist just yet. but they are welcome to do so.it would be great to get a response from csm or ccp on this."
"after participating in another thread i see two broad options for wis.the first is that each expansion has a major focus on fis and a minor focus on wis. much as crucible had a lot of inspace stuff and a small update to incarna in the form of the captains quarters.the second is an expansion (at some point) that delivers the full featured incarna (multiplayer establishments et al) and then subsequent expansions that focus only on fis"
"i fully support the questioning of ccp on matters such as this however the experience i have with public relations and marketing tells me that ccp will release information when they actually have something they can market. so it is possible they are working on new clothes that actually have color to them and they may just be also working on station environments but the simple fact is that they would only tell us if it encouraged more people to play or somehow caused an increase in revenue. ccp above all else is a business, this is especially true/significant this year. also keep in mind that ccp is horribly understaffed. they run a tight ship and only allow a specific allocation of resources to given projects. if ccp was less top heavy in how it spends it money then there would be the potential for better overall quality.however right now the impression i get from the people on the inside i talked to is that ccp likes having small teams because it is both cheaper and has a lower potential for conflict and disorganization. the problem with this is that game companies competing with ccp have more resources and staff so they can pump out quality content at a much faster and consistent rate. now do not misunderstand me, i am not trying to tell anybody at ccp how to run things, i only have a ba in management and am by no means an expert or verified authority on such matters. i am only trying to make the argument that ccp functions the way it does because it is managed to function that way. if ccp were to get \"acquired\" overnight by some observably wealthy 22 year old virgin then i can promise things would change and more people would be hired. these easily reproduced bugs and experience breaking problems would be fixed in beta. there would be more then 2 gender options and the game would have a system by which all non-trial users could vote on what they think the focus of the dev team should be. i would of course have a special team of no less then 35 devs and other staff with the exclusive focus and function of seeding the game with futanari references both written and visual in nature."
"dare i ask... how long is ccp planning on \"fixing\", revamping and adjusting fis content and settings before they get it right...seems to me they've been at that since 2003 and it never gets done with more and more suggestions and demands for fis stuff with each passing day from the very same people who demanded an end be put to incarna or they rage quit. at this rate, fis will never be done and we might as well go play 2nd life. so perhaps ccp should have 1 team dedicated to fis and a 2nd to wis, with a 3rd for everything in between.that having been said, i started playing eve for freelancer styled spaceships. i've been flying that ship for the last few years now and it's the same thing over and over again. get ship, fly ships, run into other ships, lose ships, repeat cycle. i'm about ready to retire to a permanent life of space barbie jewing isk in my gentleman's establishment.therefor, i too would like some clarity on this facet of eve. can we haz space barbie for realz now?"
"how are these contradictory approaches, pray tell?as i've been saying throughout this thread -- the next 18 months will most likely be fis heavy with fixes to all the broken things being at the forefront (pos, fw, sov, lowsec, hisec, w-space, corp roles, etc). wis stuff will be little and \"extra\" to the fix content ... maybe a corporate/alliance office or something, slowly ramping up to the \"full experience\".-- once everything is in a happy place, and they can \"neglect\" fis for an expansion cycle, the full wis thing will be unveiled. this patch will have so-so fis stuff.-- once wis is fully rolled out, a balanced approach to the stuff (though, tbh, i don't see much more than performance tweaks or a handful of new nex items ever really being added ... there's only so many iterations of \"mall foodcourt\" that can be done.)"
"who said anything about them being contradictory approaches?plus this thread isn't really about endless speculation anyway. this thread was about asking the csm to ask ccp what their plans are for wis over the next 12 months. simple really.do you get it yet?"
"well, so far after 50 days, 70 pages and 1381 messages, ccp has said an done nothing.also, from what csm say about the meeting, apparently they didn't even talked about wis (anyway i am still waiting for meissa anunthiel to answer my mail on the issue...)my impression is that wis has become that broken, half cooked feature nobody is going to look at for years.so rather than pay 6 months of subcsription as i was due tomorrow (and which likely would had fueled the development of a lot of nullsec sh<U+FFFD>t i don't care about), i just sold some stuff to afford a plex while i wait for the minutes to come out. maybe i'm naive to think they'll be out by january 14, but, alas... my alt account already was paid until may 2.i am no longer playing eve, and it's a matter of time until i stop paying for nullsec's features.with an empty and overprized nex store, no full-fledged incarna, no new casual content, no new solo content and no new pve content, i won't keep paying for someone else a getting all fun..."
"yeah i am feeling the same really. personally i don't understand the lack of response from ccp on incarna (particulary given their active participation in other threads). it's really confusing as to why they won't give a decent response on the future of wis.i don't have any problem with null sec getting some loving, as every area of eve should get some dev love, even those i don't personally participate in. but i don't want wis to be abandoned."
"first off please excuse my grammar i realise its badi have to agree there are some problems with when 1 is considered aggressed examples 1. the guy using smart bombs in a mission gets concorded when a fleet member from his own alliance happens to alow his to wounder into the smart bomb regardless to alliance and fleet 2. a ganker that sends 5 heavy drones after you from 40 km you pop his drones as there heading straight at you and hence you can track them but you get poped because the drones are not considered hostel till after they close range and start firing the bigger ishue here thou is that eve is a realistic universe with realistic market and hence you must earn your ships and such throu lots of time and so on but unrealistic negitaves for breaking the rules of said world the guy who earned a trafic ticket gets the same treatment as the mass murder that said the simplest way to fix the problem is take away inshurance payouts to death by concord make concord kill pods apon repeat offenders and standing drop increses more after each offence while ganking is still do able your resons need to be more worth it no more greving newbs and truning them away from the game"
"no leniency. no way, no how.yes to education. have the devs cook up a new tutorial session where person is given a ship by concord and instructed to do something darwinian .. throw in a bunch of text to explain what happened and why.- zero chance of exploitation (you know it will happen sooner or later) and the npe guys gets something new to get their nerd on.ps: have devs trawl the code to make sure there are not some modules/actions that are somehow evading the warning-popup."
"the next mass test will take place on our test-server singularity on thursday, december 15 at 20:00 utc. this time we are testing time dilation again to make sure that all bugs are really fixed. the sisilauncher tool is available for the windows client, otherwise please follow the instructions on the singularity page in evelopedia.testing should last between 60 and 90 minutes."
"about the bugs - that's why i proposed that only first 10 well-writen reports about a given bug would be rewarded."
"and as many of you have the issue of me having the cca 20 000 sp boost a month (assuming 30-day month, 20 000 / 1 857 600 translates into less than 1.08% boost), let's add that accounts that are or ever were paid or ever bought a plex by credit card, paypal account, or bank account, that my account ever was are not eligible.satisfied?"
"no...not ever....never.....end of discussion.this proposal was dead the moment you typed it up.and we will continue to swat it down like the annoying fly it is.================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"noyour idea will lead to a perpetual increase in the cost of pi because its causing price inflation via increasing taxation. allot of players are offsetting the increased tax costs by passing the costs down to the end buyer/consumer. so the more they pay to extract, the more you pay to buy.leave the tax price base as it is.we still have to witness a full transition to 0.0 & wh pocos and or denial of access to pi networks via standings and the effect that will have on the pi market. supply will be effected in a bad way (with 0.0 sov holders being the main producers of large quantities) and demand will remain constant if not increase. that in itself will be driving up the value of pi goods. if a 0.0 alliance owns the sovereignty, planets with a few networks on them will produce more isk in large enough numbers than 1 or 2 techmoons do on a monthly basis."
"admittedly this idea did solidify while i was closing more and more wormholes. it started off as a \"wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to jump back and forth\" concept. however, i maintain that this device wouldn't be limited to carebears. it can be deployed on a hole that someone else wants to keep open. i would be irritated if someone used these things on my hisec openings, or trapped me in a system i didn't want to be in.the main allure to me is forwarding the game; adding flexibility, options and growth. these devices would shake things up, and i expect that the result would be a far more interesting w-space experience.i understand your concern about ships in space, and i don't envision these bombs removing that. i would like to see a balance struck where these bombs are rare enough, expensive enough, and limited enough that they only supplement, rather than replace the current wormhole closing methods. the ideal situation (in my opinion) would be to have the players treat the bombs as ideal in certain situations, but otherwise not worth the money or effort. one last point i wanted to make was with the idea of risk, and i was thinking the other day that the use of these devices is a guaranteed loss. once the bomb is fired, hit or miss that isk is gone, but an armor plated, afterburner fitted battleship can close holes until it's luck eventually runs out. i admit, the bombs would make it safer to close wormholes (although, if this is a sticking point, i am happy to discuss ways to make it less so), but that safety costs isk."
"first: battleships can shoot back. *even if fired upon...those armor plates add a staggernig amount of ehp and its just enough to get backup called in at worst case. the guy tossing the bomb will likely die in 1 to 2 salvos*second: your removing risk not adding to it.third and most miprotaintly: your idea is far more expensive...a battleship is not likely going to die on the first shot...once again...you prefer to listen to yourself...and ignore everyone else.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"again i am baffled by your conclusions. you say that the battleship can defend itself, and is a tough nut to crack with all of the armor plating, while the bomb tosser is more fragile and easier to kill. to me, that sounds like it is a lot riskier to be the bomb tosser.as for it being more expensive, you're right (although the 20 million is just a ballpark guess of what a good price might be). in the long run, using bombs like this likely will end up costing someone more money than just by using battleships. the bombs would add a different method for closing wormholes, that would provide speed/convenience/tactical advantage, but demanding a high price. in some cases, it might be the best option, in others it wouldn't. that decision ultimately will be made by the player. if people think these devices are a waste of time, they won't be used and the problem will self correct."
"your confused? i'm surprised your able to type let alone make coherent thougths with the things you say.you tell me your baffeled...how much clearer can i get?have you ever flow a stealth bomber? if you had...you'd understand pretty danm quickly that its just a twig with a nuke strapped to it...and eff'ing big one at that.... one shot...maybe two...and its dead.i happen to know from personal experince that is indeed..the case.a battleship is harder to kill...but not impossible..but a might stronger and hardier than a bomber.you propose the use of bombs...to close a wormhole...and yet counteless times... we the \"wormhole space experinced peeps\" ranging from mediocer to obsessive compulsive tell you repeatedly that its too easy to use time or a battleship to close it.yet you propose to use a fragile ship...at risk to losing itself...to attack....a very expensive item... and taking into calcuations how long it takes to research...manufacture an item that would likely cost as yo usaid.... 20 million isk per bomb....only of which 2 to 3 can be used...and a pitiful amount of \"effect\" in the end to the wh.... that starts to add up to alot of wasted hours and time.further more.... the more you post....the more its very obvious you have no effing clue what your talknig about.you think you know....you think you understand....and yet you continue to ignore us...and make outlandish cop outs and excuses saying we're the insane ones and you aren't.you say you don't understand....maybe its just simply that...you don't understand because you have no experince in this area.you just keep blaming us for your failure to comprehend.i think its safe to say...after a 3 rd round of repeats..this idea is officially dead.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"we know its not an exploit, that doesn't mean it shouldn't be. to be honest though the only reason i dont rage too much about the mwd trick is because i use it more often than other players do.it still surprises me that so many people fly around low sec unscouted, yet none of them ever just stick a cloak in one of their highs. makes any ship as good as a cov ops for moving about, i use it to get my non-t3 pve ships about all the time ;dbut still, yeah, even i'll admit its lame.[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"i have no problem with cloakies, rather like them, in fact. that's why the counter would be so risky, and so weak that you'd need to think it extraordinarily worthwhile to scan a 30km radius just for a decloak. the cloaked ship still would have the upper hand, in general. stay 30km away from the black ops. nor does it have to be a black ops, but it should be something big and expensive... and risky."
"the thing is...a covert ops frigate on average is 20-40 million isk dpeending on how its fitted.force recons are a bit more expensive....but they are intended for more obvious purposes...and not likely used in afk hunting unless its intent-to-killfrigates are ideal as they are cheap and easily replaced...once they light that cyno..they are dead anyway.so you asking for a tool to solve a problem that is not a problem....and with an arbetery range of 30km....logic seems a bit self defeating...and a little overkill.10 million candle light flash light with an range of 30km in a 1 million mile area wide field and a posse with various guns looking for a mosquito sized target......and the bulb on that flashlight is platnium lined...and the ship is so expensive its insane...not to mention fragile as glass while using said flashlight.don't make a whole hell of alot of sense...with all due respect.as mentioned before...best anti-cloak measure...defense fleet on hand.... bait ship..your own cyno frigate hot and ready...cloaked.......call him in...hot drop the buggar when he hot drops you...and let the fur fly with great ethusasim and epic proportions.problem solved.works as intended. sorry.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"yup. but if you were going to do it at all, it should be something like i described. i agree that it's probably better to do nothing."
"i would just like ccp to tell us any ideas they have about fixing this broken came mechanic and when this will take place? if a dev could respond?please don't tell me \"it's not a broken came mechanic\". that is a whiners way out. this is a sandbox environment, meant to resemble real life in space. if this were real life hundreds of people would have developed an anti cloaking device long long ago. for a sandbox to work there cannot be a device/mod/skill that makes you \"untouchable\".ccp please respond to this request for a time frame to fix this broken game mechanic."
"who said it was a broken game mechanic in the first place?one would argue you are just as guilty as you claim those who said it isn't.i suggest you take a step back and rethink your argument before you make foolish statements again.*oh and nice of you to \"hide\" in a npc corp.*================ stop the evemail spam!"
"adding more isk via bounties & overseers artifacts doesn't seem right to me. neither do the taxes on goods even if it is part of roleplay. isk should flow freely and not be added or taken away magically. giving players control of the custom offices in low sec, null sec and wormhole space is a step in the right direction so why not give people control of custom offices in all of high sec? economic warfare should have a greater prescence. this can also apply to agents too, so they no longer give out isk but other bonuses which include lp.people shoot rats mainly for the bounties though not always is it fun. bounties could be replaced by special loot inside particular faction rats say serpentis boosters, guristas missiles etc. for taxing of goods, make it so that the corporations and or alliances receive the tax income. give people more tools to deprive others of their isk. if there is only a set amount of isk at any one time in the eve universe it would reduce the chance of inflation. let the rich become richer not because they can shoot the most officers but because of skill in manipulating the markets and cunning. you don't need isk to have fun in eve so the poor will not lose out."
"no. and how the hell are noobs supposed to get isk to by new ships if mission agents don't pay for the missions. all loot dropped from low level rats is next to worthless. this is just another nerf hi-sec because there is no risk thread."
"lol. a convincing and well thought out argument...i think not.lets see. incursion rats and drones and sleepers don't have bounties. hmm how do the players and new players that kill them get their isk! salvage doesn't drop isk, how do players get their isk from salvage! here is an answer, they sell the loot on the market.new loot can be created. if inter medris could be bothered to read i specifically mentioned special loot to replace the bounties.the no bounties idea would also apply to low sec ands high sec. bounties would simply be replaced by items that you sell on the market. specific agents could drop more lp and new items to sell etc."
"think about what you're saying there for a while. you'll soon realize how stupid the idea of stopping any and all isk injections are.i do agree that there is too much isk being created, but cutting isk injections altogether is a terrible, terrible idea."
"yep. how do you think irl economy works? hint: gold standard no longer in effect."
"at the minimum, carriers should have the storage capacity of an orca. if eve carriers were rl, they'd all be using a single closet as storage for the entire ship (size-wise) leading to some pissed off janitors. change it. there's no reason not to."

"not quite. a buffed carrier in this regard is nowhere close to the size of a jf. don't be naive.back to poasting;perhaps half orca stats would please those elite jf pilots screaming \"noes. i paid billions to have that spaze.\". a compromise if you will."
"aside from your flagrant attitude.... maybe you should take the time to give us your reasons you feel a carrier should be turned into an industiralist hauler and spend a little less time coming across as a playground bully.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"on a serious note i do ask why the necessity for this change. yes it would be nice to store fuel + more then 1 capital mod in there to swap from triage to pantheon fit on the fly but it is not necessary as you make it sound to be. that is why you either a) have a hauling alt / hauling ***** to follow you around with that stuffs, or b) you make wise choices before undocking."
"i'm just retrolling the trollers, bro. i expected such. now, since you've replied all serious and such, i'll respond in kind. the carrier's primary role is to support deployment to low/null space. sure, she can fit a nice contingent of ships with her but the cargo space to support the deployment of those ships is severely lacking. so, you have an average skilled player with access to an average 1.2 billion isk asset meant for that sort of deployment with the storage capacity of rigged out badger ii. once again, if we're going to try to apply balance and rl stats to pixels, it should at least be semi-realistic in nature. it just makes no sense as it is right now."
"rl life or not..the carrier's role is of 2 major purposes.1: to commence triage on the battlefield. (logistics *and why the #### did ccp use that damn word?*)2: to haul ships to its destination or provide support in that sense.the carrier is not an industiralist ship...its not designed to haul cargo en-masse.now last i checked....you can haul a ship with ammo/charges in its cargo bay...but nothing else....and guns can't be loaded for some odd reason. (feel free to correct me on that point)the only other thing youd haul would be modules and fittings...and they aren't that large.a jump freighter is superiour in every respect when it comes to hauling supplies of that nature. a jf isn't best suited to hauling ships that are fitted however.... but thats where the carrier fills that niche to a point.so i get you want to stike a balance...but the tools are already present....until you can give me a valid argument aside from \"this would be nice\"....can't really support this.ps: irl a carrier is not a cargo hauler either...it relies on its flotilla and outside support to get its supplies...and comparing a floating city to one in eve is a bit of a stretch...ok maybe not even close to that....and its internal supplies as far as that carrier is concerned is not one of cargo hauling to other bases of operation..that's tasked to cargo haulers...such as c-31's or even ship freighters. your logic at that rate is reaching....ps2: not that im saying this a terrible idea....just hard to justify.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"are you implying a carebear's opinion is any less valuable than your own?the way you're sounding right now you look like an idiot."
"on the surface, it could be difficult to justify given all the *other* tools at our disposal. however, the average grunt that would benefit from this sort of change the most probably doesn't have a multi-billion isk jf and skilled character at the ready and definitely not his own flotilla of alts and ships to support a simple deployment. the orca comparison i made was based simply on size so i retract that. one is an industrial and the other not. however, i still propose some buff to at least a third of capacity in both areas."
"it's not as expensive as it seems to afford a jf....specially if your attempting to support a multi billion if not trillion alliance that requiers supplies to field caps...such as a carrier.jfs are expensive because of long range and massive cargo hulaing capability...but they are risky to use and employ...i myself am a jf pilot...and currently working towards a second one to aid my corp/alliance.as far as carriers are concerned...they fill their niche quite well...the only thing i'd like to see is a bit more offensive capabilities if not some additional defense...as far as cargo hauling.... not really convinced it will do much...but then it wouldn't hurt either.carriers don't do a whole heck of alot....a carrier in irl is capable of inititating attacks and strikes by deployment of its fighter craft.a carrier in eve isn't even close to that....it drops fighters sure....but they are just frigate sized drones that could...possibly be a problem....but not an offensive problem....at best.i may not have a solid answer to your argument...but a jf is more preferable for the role you seek than a carrier would be...but as i've said yet again....there's no harm in buffing cargo space either.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"have you looked into the rorqual? yes, it is an extra two weeks of training (for barge 5, if you don't already have it), but it seems to fill the role you're looking for and doesn't require reworking any existing ships.i will admit that i wouldn't mind seeing some more cargo room in carriers, but there are alternatives."
"wouldn't work...rorquals are restriced to only carrying industrialist class ships in the ship maint array.while it can haul... a jf wins out even with price tag attached.granted the rorqual is likely going to do better in its nasty array of drone defenses....but then an orca would surpass it as far as ship carrying ability...even a carrier...offense and defense is debatable.================ stop the evemail spam!"

"no, the eve community has to rethink \"virtual items\". there are already micro transactions in eve: convert plex to isk, spend tiny amounts of real money through isk as a proxy (e.g.: for a pile of imperial navy multifrequency l crystals). the nex is a luxury virtual goods store: nothing \"micro\" about those transactions at all.other markets have shown that halving the cost of an item approximately doubles the sales. there is no advantage to having low-value items (i.e.: traditional \"micro transaction item stores\"). people who want the items will find the money to buy them, regardless of cost. this is what ccp zulu was on about with his \"$1000 designer jeans\" statement: for the insanely rich, price is not a consideration. for the record, there are also $100k designer jeans out there, along with <U+FFFD>42b luxury sports cruisers made of gold.when it comes to convenience items (or \"concierge\" items, as per fearless), i am of two minds: on one hand, they are a vile, foul addition to the game that will inevitably lead to the corruption of ccp by simple greed. on the other hand they are a useful tool to allow free-to-play (i.e.: unlimited length trials) without overly impacting the rest of the game. having more people online will lead to more people being online: that is, the more people any one player can interact with, the less likely they will be to simply log out and go play some other more interesting game. if you don't think that simply having more people online at any one time is a worthwhile goal, go talk to us players in california, or australian/new zealand/se asian players in general.hopefully ccp gains some useful insights from the 60 day trial experiment (which is really just an extension of the 51 day trial experiment they've already been performing). what impact will free-to-play accounts have on the rest of the game, assuming there are sufficient barriers in place to make subscribing attractive?"
"absolutely no mts. eliminate nex and aurum and allow these items to be produced by players. this summer and the exodus that occurred should have sent that message. ccp can't keep ignoring the player base if they want eve and dust to succeed."

"the best you would be able to store is the date the ship was actually assembled - i.e., not the date it was built, but the date someone right clicked on the item stack and said \"assemble ship\". that date would be lost at any point someone repackaged the ship.the problem is that, in order to conserve database rows, an item doesn't get it's own row if it's part of a stack. the stack gets a row with a quantity indicator that shows how many of that item are in the stack. when the ship gets assembled, it gets it's own row that you can store the name, etc, in, but if the ship gets repackaged, that data is destroyed."
"the whole concept of station games is boring and lame. the best way to deal with station games is to make it so that both sides can force their opponents out of stations. by paying a small fee, the party can bribe the station owner into kicking someone out of the station and forcing them to engage them. this will be both good and bad for both sides. the dynamics of highsec war decs will change with this."

"in eve there are several problems with the graduation from high sec to low sec. there is a huge difference between 0.5 and 0.4. my proposal is to smooth it out with an npc response that is insta-death in 1.0 to a slow buildup of police in 0.1. with a smoother graduation the risk can increase a little more linearly giving 0.5 some danger and 0.4 some safety compared to what we have now.my proposal is to have concord be certain death with a response time (like we have now). the difference is that the faction police would take over the job for 0.5 and below. a ganker in 0.5 could live if they were quick enough. below is the outline of the idea.1) concord and faction police are different forces. concord are still unbeatable but the faction police are kill-able and escape-able. introduce faction hits for committing any infraction that causes the faction police to show up. bigger faction hits for actually killing faction police. as the sec status goes down faction police response is lower and slower. in a 0.9 you might get a very large and instantaneous response. in a 0.1 it might take 2 minutes for the faction police to show up and they trickle in slowly as long as the pirate is criminally flagged or undesirable status. the drops on faction police would contribute to lp or tags or something fw, no isk.2) more granularity for security status. no more high/low/0.0 splits with very little difference between them. each step means a meaningful something. concord and faction police show up for things, but at different times. concord are inescapable but the faction police are more numbers based, and may have scrambling ships. 0.5 you might be able to escape from the faction police. maybe. concord shows up from 1.0 - 0.6. from 0.5 to 0.1 only faction police show up.1.0 - no wardecs honoured. instant concord. no insurance. this is basically newbie friendly space. highly reactive faction security forces. islands of very safe space around every faction stronghold / newbie centre.0.9 - concord delay (3 seconds)0.8 - war declarations honoured. concord delay (6 seconds)0.7 - concord delay (9 seconds)0.6 - longer concord delay (15 seconds)0.5 - no concord, faction police only. a response time of 12 seconds and a strong response. possible to escape. it will chase pilots around and contain warp scrambling ships. good ai and an escalation every minute to ensure that they are not chained or takable for long periods of time. it would be possible for criminals to run away and jump out of system or dock. if you gank in this space you should die half the time.0.4 - faction police only. response time of 20 seconds. the initial force in would not scramble. the faction forces get reinforced every 1 minute, introducing scrambling ships and escalating until the criminals are no longer in system.0.3 - faction response 40 seconds. approximately half the response of 0.4 systems.0.2 - faction response 1 minute. approximately half the response of 0.3 systems.0.1 - faction response 2 minutes. approximately half the response of 0.2 systems.0.0 - as it is now."
"i'm ambivalent on the wardecs thing being limited to 0.8 on down, if only for the simple fact that it turns hiding in stations into hiding in 1.0 space.here's a rough idea i came up with for some other thread:1.0 --> no changes from current0.9 --> rats introduced0.8 - 0.7 --> no changes changes from current0.6 - 0.5 --> remove concord, replace with navies (navies can be avoided, system rules otherwise unchanged)0.4 --> no navy, welcome to supercaps online0.3 - 0.1 --> no changes0.0 --> no changesin 0.9 - 0.0, reduce the respawn timers on rocks (no more of this once/day stuff).now, slow down concord in 0.9 - 0.7 systems, essentially to what happens in 0.5 or 0.6 now (20-30 sec or so). have the navies work in waves, with the waves showing up in the same timelines as concord (20-30 sec)first wave -- normal navy ships (iirc, no scrams)second wave -- scrams brought inthird wave -- enough dps to concordokken you if you're still alive.with that then, you can choose to sit around through the first wave and gtfo just as the second is coming in (so about a minute). if you run from the navy, you have 15 minutes to bounce around the system before the gates/stations let you pass. now, since you're running from the navy, they won't bother with the \"waves\" as you're running around. you'll have 20 sec or less to re-enter warp after you've landed at a celestial or safespot before the concordokken fleet arrives. for those of you thinking \"hey, i'll just safe up and cloak\" -- the navy will cheat in this regard (i.e. see right through your cloak)."

"agreed in principle, but how do you create a mechanic that allows corp thieves to have a bounty put on their head but that doesn't open any corp director who spends corp isk to being killed for it?a bounty system that is based on killrights could conceivably mesh with the wardec system since the essence of a wardec is that it allows all of corp a and corp b to have mutual killrights, then members of corp a could put bounties on wartarget corp b that can only be collected by members of corp a"

"actually i don't really agree with that. the price will always stabilize at whatever people can make a profit at. just look at the profit margin on something that is easy to make and has a high consumption rate, like ammo. your average highsec miner will took at their minerals and look at what they can build with those minerals, and if they can make even one isk more selling the finished product over the raw minerals they will do it.i did some math and feel free to correct me if i am wrong.lets say you are doing the most tax expensive thing with pi. importing refined commodities, building, and exporting specialized commodities to sell.i got these prices off of the average buy price in empire space from eve central, so i don't know what the actual prices would be in your region.lets say you are making neocoms that cost 80000.00 per unit. you'll need to buy biocells at 9191.91 per unit and silicate glass at 4646.92 per unit. you'll need 5 biocels 45959.55 isk, 5 silicate glass 23234.60 isk, which will produce 3 neocoms which can be sold for a total of 240000.00 isk. so after buying all the biocells and silicate glass if you sell the neocoms you'll make 170805.85 isk in raw profit without taxes.now lets say you paid 10% taxes on the current market value of all the materials, once to import the 5 biocells and 5 silicate glass and once again to export the 3 neocoms. that comes out to 30919.42 isk. subtract that from your raw profit and after taxes you are still left with 139886.44 isk.so if my math is right (my spreadsheet looks ok so far) if you set up your planets in jita paying carebear tears 10% tax based on live market data for every factory churning our neocoms you'd make 139886.44 per hour. and anyone with decent pi skills can put quite a few factories on a planet and have quite a few planets running. yeah you'll miss out on the 30919.42 per factory per hour tax, but that's the price you pay for the warm embrace of a concord security blanket.after fiddling with the numbers i figured out that ccp could raise the tax to 55% of market value before you'd stop making a profit on neocoms. granted at that point the profit margin on pi in highsec would be so low that people probably wouldn't bother.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"thing is, yeah ... right now the prices are *really high* for stuff because nearly everyone is paying 10 or 17% tax ... give it a little while for people to start venturing into low, and prices will probably start to drop (stupid lemmings who drop the price because they're paying 11% less tax than they used to)"
"drake, i think what is obvious to anyone who reads this thread is that you either are a troll (my opinion) or can't handle anyone disagreeing with you.you've become increasingly belligerent, and have tried to use your anger and insults as a substitute for mature, rational discussion. you imagine that you being butthurt makes you right, or that at least people who read your rants will give your comments more weight because of your passion and indignation. but, really, your comments are hollow. you've offered very little to the debate.hours and time? do you think that i am proposing that the only way to close wormholes from now on should be through the use of bombs? because that's not part of my idea at all. if the bombs are a \"pitiful\" waste of time, then i expect that they wouldn't be used. you have gone back and forth from this being an insta-win, too powerful game breaking idea to it being a waste of hours and also time. those are two completely opposite positions and for the sake of your credibility in this discussion, it behooves you to pick one."

"in a reality with scarce goods, you could probably make this idea work. but eve doesn't work that way. asteroid fields magically repopulate after downtime, rats respawn endlessly, and ice never disappears. fixing the economy to a finite resource will simply result in massive deflation, as items will flow into the system faster than they are destroyed. you're simply swapping one problem (too much isk) for another one (too much stuff) which creates a skewed market."
"following your suggestion to remove isk faucets wholesale while keeping isk sinks, isk would become a scarce resource with limited supply, which will eventually be hoarded and fall into disuse. the word \"deflation\" won't begin to describe the damage on economic mobility. daily transactions would have to be conducted via an alternative material currency, most likely basic minerals that get magically regenerated. never mind using any tools for transaction that involves isk, let alone buying skill books, lp items, new blue prints, etc. the amount of overhead would devolve the economy into something seen in history books, like the roman empire or 18c britain.that's simply too much pain in the rear. for awful trading experiences, diablo 2 was more than enough.

"wouldn't that also lead to bombing runs becoming as trivial as tying ones shoe-laces (read: dumbing it down)?one of the balancing factors of the things is that they require planning and coordination to pull off successfully as one ideally needs a warp-out 'behind' the target to avoid return fire .. would much rather want to see a suicide function where loaded bombs can be detonated while in the bay (ie. 2x current damage at cost of ship and probably pod). would open up a whole new can of worms as the things are pretty cheap relative to their preferred prey .. bombing runs with zero warning and no bubbling required .. at a cost. now that is an anti-blob tool for the ages"

(pos1 can be at 1 or all of the poses you have up) & (for argument sake lets just say that pos only has permission for the player to go inside it)now lets say you only want him to be able to use the ship assembly arry. so you just add him into the group \"manufacturing\"this would be a pain for larger corp's/alliances however people will only have access to what they are given. the current layout is kind of like inharited permissions are locked and your thowing the users directly into the permission scheam rather then adding to an ou then the ou to the object.whew.... if you dont understand, please do not call you local it help desk. lol"

"+1 if ccp is sincere in wanting to reinvigorate eve and fix old mechanics then they ought to give thought out threads like this a read the proposal is pretty sound, requiring little more than loophole search-and-destroy"
"ok i see that complication what i meant was, isn't the easiest way around that to let anyone and everyone take the bounties? especially since the bounties themselves are going to be a percentage of the total bounty? kill-rights for all until the bounty has been paid out? that way even if you used an alt or friend to murder yourself (which still doesn't make sense because your loosing money on every kill) that would only be one of who knows how many peoplei think the kill-right angle might be a little much not because its not a good idea but because i think in practice, a working bounty system will used to grief justifiably maybe or in some cases not but if the amendments only affect payouts then at least a bountied criminal could hide in sec-space kinda like going to prison, :p if bounties worked, a huge number of players would go hunting huge its a thing i'm new though so maybe i am missing something?"

"i was going to let this thread die, but i had to come back and say that those are great comments. you raise some good points. i was hopeful to dig into the specific vulnerabilities of stealth bombers, but i didn't get the opportunity. if these worked like most bombs, they'd have to be deployed 30k away from the target. a pilot could essentially align cloaked up, decloak and fire the bomb without having to lock, then they could be well out of scrambler range and warping off to a safe spot before the bomb detonates. would it make more sense to have the bomb have a shorter range and travel slower? make the range something like 15k, and have it travel at 1.5k/sec? that would mean you would be in range of just about any ship camping the hole. additionally, it could have less hp, making it vulnerable to smartbombs. what do you think? bombs stay on grid even after you leave it, but missiles in flight vanish when you leave the grid; if there was a way to require the bomber to stay on grid as you suggest, that could be an interesting feature. any of this sound feasible? i'm open to suggestions.the orca thing was just to show that it is possible to close a wormhole very quickly with massive ships. you're right, it's not an equal comparison, but at the time i was responding to someone who was objecting to the idea of quickly popping a wormhole. i just wanted to point out that there are currently ways to quickly pop a wormhole without these bombs. you're right, it's not the same thing, but in the circumstances..."
"so you want to take the hole-control aspect of wormhole pvp away completely? that would make it nearly impossible for an invaded system to bring in reinforcements.this idea is so bad anyone supporting it should be embarassed."
"eve's game mechanics are built around scifi lore. i was offering an explanation of why a wormhole-closing bomb wouldn't fit within lore (lack of mass). you go off on how it's all a bunch of ones and zeroes and can be reprogrammed as ccp sees fit. you're clearly a lot of fun at parties.edit: after catching up with the thread, i'd be okay with this if the mineral expense of these \"bombs\" was equivalent to the mineral expense of a ship that would deplete the same amount in a wormhole. in other words, you can build a one-shot bomb, or you can build a battleship. this way it would be the same as simply shoving empty ships through the wormhole until it closed.for those who think there should be an inherent risk involved in closing wormholes: my solution is that if someone is willing to put such significant resources into mitigating a little bit of risk, they deserve the relative safety. they also deserve to be quite a bit poorer than those wormhole corps who keep their hard-earned isk and minerals and close wormholes the old-fashioned way."
"i'm suggesting adding more tools that can be used by pvp and pve players to manipulate wormholes to their tactical advantage.there are lots of different interpretations of wormholes in fiction, and eve has it's own lore. consider the talocan, who were \"masters of spatial manipulation and hypereuclidean mathematics\". this race likely knew how to make wormholes. don't you wonder why no wormholes lead to jove space, despite their proximity to the rest of k-space? it implies to me that wormhole inhibition technologies exist and are used by the jove to isolate their systems. thousands of years ago, humankind traveled through eve gate to get here, and when that wormhole sealed shut behind us considerable effort would have been made to study, understand and re-open it. imagine the frantic populace, cut off from earth, all urging their scientists to figure out a way to get back home. decades of research and experimentation probably went towards understand the fundamental mechanics of wormholes, even as civilization crumbled around them. perhaps there is some lost knowledge, protected by the jove or hidden in sleeper databanks that explains a piece of the puzzle. i could not have said it better myself. we disagree on the cost, but i completely agree with the essence of your point."
"same difference, regarding the language. you effectively end a corp or alliance having the ability to reinforce or rescue a corp or ally because it simply becomes way to easy to close and roll holes. it would have been impossible, for example, for the aquila hole to have been liberated when the russians invaded if every hole simply could be blown up instead of requiring ships to actually jump through them to take the mass off of them.this would severely break wormhole mechanics. it's a horrible idea in light of that."
"i'm not familiar with that specific incident - do you have a link or any details? i live in a wormhole with a static to nulsec, and so if someone comes into our hole and picks a fight, none of our allies are going to even be able to bring forces to come to our rescue.again, i have to point out that there are a lot of different ways to do this; i'm not proposing that these bombs insta-pop wormholes. i agree with you that a device that could take out a healthy wormhole in one shot would be uberpowerful and would likely be abused. here is just a brief list of ideas - i'm sure there are more. the bombs could only take time off of a wormhole's life, not mass. they could reduce the current available mass by a fraction (by half or by a third), which would mean they could never truly close a hole. the bombs could reduce a variable amount of mass (and/or time) \"damage\", making it less predictable. they could have a fixed \"damage\" of mass (and/or time)"
"aquila incident.more on it...the second post especially, read through the linked battle reports etc. and you'll understand why i consider this to be a bad idea. although i can appreciate the desire from a single corps perspective, it affects things much larger. it effects the entire world."
"i am a little dubious about getting reinforcements from one wormhole system to another, but maybe the alliances span so many systems that it is actually feasible. way out of my league. i am trying to grasp your argument, though. here is what i think you're saying (correct me if i am wrong).that would be a fair point, but i don't see why different means bad."
"so basically you're butt-hurt because a covops hauler got through your gate-camp, so you want a guaranteed method to catch them instead of actually earning some real pvp kills?horribly bad idea."
"i'm sorry you're mad cause i'm right. it's ok and you'll get over it eventually. you keep lying to yourself and everything will be ok in your head. any time i cloak in 0.0 at a safe spot i am completely untouchable. you tell me what 0.0 space you live in and i'll come out there in my cloaky nulli t3 and cloak up at a safe spot. then you try to find me. i could leave this toon there until eve dies and you will never find me. just for your benefit, that is the definition of \"untouchable\". no need to respond as i'm through fighting about this with an unarmed person. i feel as though i'm taking advantage of you.ccp. please respond with a fix time frame for this broken game mechanic.thank you."
"so what? you're cloaked and safe somewhere and can't be touched.big frakking deal. cloak up in a wormhole, same thing, yet no one bitches about that. ever stop to wonder why? ever really sit down and think about the real difference, and real issue here?no? well, you seem to think cloaking is the problem, so obviously you haven't. let me enlighten you, and solve the alleged problem at the same time without breaking the cloaking mechanic or severly nerfing wormholes. you're sitting down, right?good.the problem is simple... when you're cloaked up in null sec (or anywhere else in empire), people can still see you're in the system. crazy, isn't it? the whole \"afk cloak\" whine-fest is based on that simple fact... people can still see you're there while cloaked. so... how do we fix this without breaking other aspects of the game... aspects that rely on cloaking working as it does now? first of all, removing local isn't the answer. too nuclear. empire has local, the natives rely on local, let them keep their local. in light of the real problem, and in order to preserve local in empire spaces, here's the solution.1. when a ship cloaks, it gets removed from local. it's freakin' cloaked... you should see it at all.2. when a ship cloaks, it loses access to local. you can't be seen, you can't see them either. if you're going to gather intel, go hunting, etc. you need to actively work to get the data you need. works great in wormholes, would work just as well in the softer spaces.3. to prevent abuse regarding hot drops, have there be a delay in being able to light a cyno after decloaking. length of delay to be determined... 15 seconds, 30 seconds... the point is to offset the \"surprise!\" factor enough to keep it sporting. possible exception should be considered for black ops ships... they're a special class that shouldn't have this restriction imo.there you go... the afk cloaking problem is gone. *poof* cloaks don't get broken, and actually get a little better balanced. intel gathering while cloaked becomes an active endeavour instead of passive. null space gets to retain a degree of the danger it's supposed to have that you'd lose by nerfing cloaks. bots get easier to be snuck up on. all in all, a better balanced plan that breaks nothing that i can see."
"1.) the anti-cloaking bubble is a terrible idea. it makes gate camps completely op, and is just bad for the game. 2.) while off topic from the original idea, its very much on topic of the rest of the thread: a cloaker-hunter mechanic, that allows you to find cloakies in system must not be implemented until the all powerful intel tool of local gets changed. if you create a way to purge cloakers from your system, then you can effectively make your system completely safe. frankly, this is not how nullsec life is meant to be... and if you can't deal with constant potential danger, then go back to hisec!!!"
"nice....but removal of local from the cloaked ship kinda defeats the purpose of a cloakie doing recon in a system.but at least its inventive.edit: removal of local all together (like whs...delayed local) is best imho.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"not really... it just minimizes free intel. you need to actively search out what you want to know, like currently in wormholes."
"not necessarily.don't get me wrong... i do like the concept....but it would be best if it was delayed local in 0.0 much like whs.your the fool if you reveal yourself in open space.and cloaked or not... no ones gonna know your there until its too late.but then the whiney tearful _____bears are gonna #### their brains out even if local was removed in that fashion i fear.would make life interesting.but blinding the cloaky...i would think at a minimum if smoeone speaks in local...cloaky should hear it/know it.blinding him isn't gonna be a perfect solution either because all he'd have to do is record or ask someone else to report in on such things....good try tho...but hard to beat delayed local solution.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"and what about the risk to the cloakers?i don't think it's right that you can have this module on your ship that makes you 100% safe.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"i know, i know, quoting myself in response to a post... but meh, i'm lazy. cloaking isn't 100% safe unless you never uncloak, in which case it isn't a threat.if you have a carebear alliance that can't defend it's space against whatever could come through a covert cyno, then you probably shouldn't be in nullsec anyway.[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"+1 for getting rid of local in 0.0. i completely agree that 0.0 should not have anything that relates to empire.however, this is a completely different topic to be discussed in a different thread.the cloaking game mechanic is broken and must be fixed. onc"

"analyse:a year or so back:a while ago some material specification of t2 ships changed. this was an indirect nerf and buff to some moon materials aka moongoo. moon have rarity classifications. there are 5 classes,#1. gasses#2. rarity 8 (cobalt, scandium, titanium, thungsten)#3. rarity 16 (cadmium, vanadium, chromium, platinum)#4. rarity 32 (caesium, technetium, hafnium, mercury)#5. rarity 64 (promethium, dysprosium, neodymium, thulium)before this change of material specification, certain r64<U+FFFD>s were very profitable. those were mostly promethium & dysprosium and in lesser extend neodymium and thulium. moon mining gives always a fixed amount of moon materials that can be harvested. at peek market times the rarity 64 moons made:promethium 7b a monthdysprosium 9b a monthneodymium 3,5b a monththulium 4,5b a monthcurrent situation:after the t2 material spec change a certain bottleneck moongoo item became very valuable. some people agrued this is intentional or a hasty mistake that got overlooked. it brought us in the current situation that a rarity 32 moongoo is more valuable than 6 rarity 64 moons together. this screenshot explains a lot:moon distri.how this could happen, who knows but its effects are wide spread across eve. neodymium & thulium are giving a few hundred million profit a month and dyspro and prom are hardly getting above 1 bilion isk profit marker per month. a technetium moon is worth equal or more than the highest r64 profit moon a year ago. 1 technetium moon is worth 6 r64 moons. this can not be right. on the screenshot u can conclude multiple explanations and combine them. the technetium moons are the least spread moons in the game. they are clustered tighter in a handful of region bordering each other. the geographic location of these moons make it a close cluster, a bff magnet. this also creates an trading cartel. since the items made from technetium is an t2 production bottleneck, an cartel has an extra steep impact on the market prices. the ability to apply this and the isk benefits coming forth out of this creates and unhealthy political situation. it is comparable to an arms race, only this isk race is one sided and unmatchable. the defenders can whelp many more fleets and suicide on anything, bankrupting attackers due the hugh unbalanced free isk income. fail indicators:-r32 more valuable than 6x r64<U+FFFD>s-cartel forming-non invasion pacts (nip) for protection of isk farming (blue lists)-dynamic 0.0 politic situation broken-moon geographic location not comparable to other moon math<U+FFFD>s-dynamic 0.0 pvp situation is broken (north = boring)-technetium products is t2 bottleneck- one racial moon product is way more used than the races<U+FFFD>s productsmy proposal is to relook at the t2 material change, or review moon mining in general, or review moon distribution (it<U+FFFD>s a prehistory distribution out 2004)."

"i said good day sir!the \"hammer\" of cva has spoken!"
"and this \"easier for older players\" sh@t is ridiculous. why shouldn't it be easier for older players? these implants do not give that much of a bonus at all. i'm actually curious to see if you have an actual reason why the game should change from being geared towards the older to the newer player. and don't give your bull **** reason of it drives people away because we both know that there are more people playing now than a few years back. so any response? lemme cover part of your argument for you really quick:\"alex you are an idiot who can't spell in an alliance nobody knows\"so that part is covered for you now. :)"
"i'm sympathetic to the idea behind this, but i won't easily support ideas where the solution to a problem is removing that aspect entirely from the game just to get rid of the issue. i would simply prefer to see a fix to the issue, since you have to address the same issue repeating with hardwirings anyway. that fix would be to allow easier access to jump clones and allowing local clone switching without any timers.how i vision it is to basicly make jump clone access an easy, basic facet of the game. easiest solution for this is propably to allow people to simply buy jump clones from the market and allow transferring them(generic jump clone template -item) as a normal item, so they are easy to move around and get. when you activate one it becomes one of your jumpclones and an implanted jump clone would function like a rigged ship, since they work in a very similar fashion. so basicly if you repack it, you lose the implants and it stops being your jump clone. if the goal is to have everyone have access to them, make it so you get one jumpclone and the required skill from a jumpclone tutorial.i wouldn't lose any sleep if learning implants would go away, but as i said it would still leave the issue with having wrong hardwirings intact. that issue needs to be solved too and any solution to that issue will also solve the learning implant issue at the same time, since it's basicly the same problem. so once you have a fix for the hardwiring issue, you've also succesfully removed the need to remove learning implants."
"i like the idea of \"jump clone vouchers\" being sold on the lp store as opposed to requiring ridiculous standings (because lol grinding missions) or access to a player outpost. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"it isn't. one careless mistake can still cost you your ship and pod, whether you are in an ibis or in an erebus. false dilemma? the game is not geared towards the older player precisely because of the way the skill system works (diminishing returns.)precisely for that reason - the game is balanced to an extent where high-sp veterans cannot simply and effortlessly farm kills on newer players (aside from ganking ibises in lowsec, but that's different)yep! \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"the standing thing with the jump clones is high, but since you have the ability to make one with a rorqual or with access to an outpost in null sec i don't think its that big of a deal. especially since if you don't have the access to null you probably don't really need a jump clone anyway. point being if you live in high sec there is no point in jumping out of your +5's unless its to switch to your slaves, and if you do live in high sec you are up there enough to have the standing with someone to make a jump clone anyway. if you live in null you probably have access to a station. so i don't really see the point to making jump clones more available."
"if you live in high-sec, you don't need to jump out of your implant clone, but wartargets (or a guy in an instalocking pod-popping thrasher) can ruin your day. it'd be nice to see jump clones made more accessible (not everyone who lives in 0.0 has easy access to them unless they're blue to a sov-holding alliance) and it'd allow people to use their wallet to their advantage, not having to grind standings when they have the isk ready (as is the case with implants, faction mods, faction ammo, etc.) \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"you really haven't given a reason why learning implants are bad for the game. i'd also like to point out, different aspects of the game all age together: as you grow higher in skill points, you become experienced enough to make isk much more quickly than a new player. as you grow higher in skill points, the average training time of skills you train are measured in weeks, not days or hours. as you grow higher in skill points, you have a much more expensive clone, you often fly much more expensive ships, and so using expensive implants is not a big deal. there is no easy-mode of older players... some things get easier (making isk), but things get riskier too (losing a pod)."
"yea in no way was i saying the game is easy on older players, they have as much risk, in fact more risk than a new player. but being able to afford expensive implants is an advantage though that an older player should have. getting rid of learning implants takes part of that advantage away. but i agree with you guys that the game isn't on easy mode for older players, nor should it be. but the older players should be allowed their advantages, especially with the risk that comes with having them. the game should not be toned down because some people are scared of flying around in their implants."

"you're an idiot. that is not what i am discussing. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"lol back to that again. and bull **** it isn't. the whole point of this thread was to bring up the idea of dropping learning implants because they are \"inconvenient\" for certain players and players in null sec don't use them and it'd make the game better for new players and i don't wanna get podded in +5's and have my day ruined. directly or indirectly this idea of yours reduces the risk for people who fly around low/null in +5's because all of a sudden everyone has them naturally in their head. i get what you are trying to do, you are trying to get people trained up quicker, people train up quick enough as it is.will +5's get you into a ship quicker? yeswill they have you flying that ship a lot better, quicker? yeswill it break your character if you don't have +5's? notaking away the risk of flying around with +5's and possibly having your day ruined to make the game a little more care bear friendly isn't worth it."

"how about a little love for amarr drones, ccp?"
"excellent ideas in this thread. tying payouts to a non-100% value of ship/pod losses seems like the right way to plug that pod-yourself-and-profit loophole.as long as the bounty payout is less than (total value of the ship & mods - the insurance payout + the cost of insurance), i don't see how insurance will be too much of an issue. however, i can see a non-dirt-poor hunted pilot trying to grief those who placed the bounty on him by destroying his own plat-insured ships for a small loss each and eating up the bounty escrow quickly. hunted pilot loses a bunch of isk but the party who placed the bounty loses a lot more since the hunted pilot's losses are mitigated by insurance. such a tactic being available would reduce the potential for gudfights arising from the bounty's placement. perhaps the insurance payouts to the hunted pilot for dead ships should also be paid into his bounty escrow with matching amounts to eliminate this tactic. i.e. if the hunted party plat-insures all their ships, they still get the insurance but the bounty sticks around longer, and trying to bleed down the escrow by self-killing would require more isk sacrifice by the hunted pilot.of course this injects double the isk into the economy from insurance payouts on the hunted pilot, so perhaps it's undesirable; i'm no market guru."
"well, maybe not to everyone, but at least everyone with a certain skills level and right corp standings.i'll try to explain what exactly i have in mind.it has been some time since the ccp abolished the \"lottery\" where you could get any t2 bpo. whether you get them because of pure luck or providence of some higher power is not an issue to which i will go today.the point is that they should be available to new players.take for example co-processor ii blueprint, to create a copy of the blueprint you need some equipment as: datacore - electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering, incognito data interface and copy of co-processor i blueprint.you also need some skills like science and electronics both at level 5, and some other at lower level like hacking, electromagnetic physics, electronic engineering and gallente encryption methods.what i propose is that people who have the necessary skills and equipment be allowed to annually make one t2 bpo at an appropriate r&d agent, of whose corporations have required standing.so for example if you want to make co-processor ii blueprint original you need this: - several hundred datacore both electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering( for ship bpo more than thousand of both type ) - both skills for electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering at level 5 - also science, hacking and electronics at level 5 - one original co-processor i blueprint - several copy of co-processor ii blueprint - one incognito data interface - some type of tools like stolen formulas, symbiotic figures, collision measurements, engagement plan - and od course isk, lots of isk ( for equipment and ammo several hundred million isk, and for ships more than billion) once you have all the equipment and materials go to the right r&d agent ( one that have both skills with electromagnetic physics and electronic engineering ), provide him with all required equipment and materials and of course you pay him with isk and he provide you with your blueprint, but you can only do this once a year and only with one r&d agent."

"spotting a moving fleet is bad example of this, even though you can use map for that to some extent if you have some experience.i am personally using map and api for intel with good effectiveness and i do not think it is a good thing for my victims and i see no reason why i get all this nice information for free. like i said hi sec is kind of different so i have no problem with map intel on hi sec, though, only low sec and 0.0.i do, however, wonder if pos cyno beacons and active cyno jammers should show on map since they're sort of static structures so having public intel on them would make sense, at least much more than people docked or in space or heck npc's killed in hour. i think npc kill number is most immersion breaking of all."

"when running missions or deadspace complexes, there are frequently structures there that can be blown up. i would like to propose that ccp revisit how these large collidable objects (lco's) behave and what they leave behind when they are destroyed. specifically, i would like to propose the following: expand the loot drop tables to include more random, mundane items like trade goods. on stations and large structures, these should be in abundance, intermingled with the occasional valuable bauble. all lco vessels (this means the prop ships floating in plexes) should be destructible unless there is a stated reason for them not to be so.every lco that gets destroyed should leave behind at least metal scraps and token garbage (even if it is mostly worthless). the more massive the lco, the more there should be. it is preposterous to see a giant space station explode after prolonged bombardment and have absolutely nothing left behind. consider what gets left behind when a ship is destroyed, and then try to explain why structures many times more massive simply evaporate into nothing. if ccp decides to make a given lco drop nothing, that structure should be untargetable (or otherwise marked) so players don't waste their time. replace the largest lco's with wrecked versions or debris fields when they are destroyed. when ships are blown up, they leave behind wreckage, shouldn't there still be something left in space? perhaps this wreckage could be both salvaged and looted, and not just a lone jet can in space.i look forward to your feedback."

"a simple idea to get people more involved in eve.at the moment i cannot fathom why someone would remain in an npc corp for longer than a year, except to \"evade\" wardecs, and therefore exploit game mechanics and play counter to the \"spirit\" of eve.this idea is an extension of ccp's decision for an automatic 10% tax in all npc corporations. tax would, after perhaps a month, begin to increase at a rate of maybe 2% per week (just a figure i randomly came up with, there may be better ones).players would not be able to \"reset\" the tax by leaving and re-joining an npc corp, as their previous tax would be remembered and continued from. or if that's too harsh, maybe the amount of tax would slowly diminish as long as someone is outside the npc corp, allowing them to spend some time outside before returning to less tax (that would then begin increasing again)maybe there could be a skill to reduce the rate of tax increase, not sure, just musing.this idea will encourage players who are essentially playing eve as a single player grind to explore the pleasures of playing a multiplayer game in a manner that is also multiplayer."

"different means bad in this case simply because you take away the ability for reinforcements to ever arrive. you completely break wormhole system assault pvp by reducing it to a faceroll once you get your fleet and bombs in there. instead of the chance of reinforments arriving, it's over before it begins.don't be dubious about the ability to get reinforcements... i was there. that was one hell of a weekend. we wound up having to come in through null if i recall, and then it was two or three holes deep to get in there. once hole control was won, the scanners did the rest. such an epic battle would have been reduced to a footnote: system invaded and lost. there would have been no write-ups... no coalition of wormholes alliances answering the call to arms to help defend friends and allies... no... you'd be taking away far, far too much from the game for what really is nothing gained, except a little safety in rolling holes, which is damaging enough."
"if the main objection is that alliances and big groups can't dominate w-space as easily, i say that is even more reason to implement this plan immediately.wormholes aren't condusive for alliances and mega corps. they are inherently isolated systems that can only sustain a handful of pilots. you can probably attest that finding the route to get reinforcements into your wormhole was likely a giant pain in everyone's ass; wormhole geometry isn't good for that kind of mobilization. w-space is elementally divisive."
"you actually allow the big alliances to dominate with these things. right now, even a small corp can scream for help from narwhals or the like and actually get it. you would doom every small corp in wormholes to being unable to ever get help if invaded, be that help from other alliances members, mercenaries, etc.it's critical that people be allowed a chance to reinforce their systems if needed, to call in the calvary when all hope is lost. you would break that, making the initial invasion itself the final act instead of the events of the next day and a half. i'll tell you what... bounce this off someone in narwhals for example... they specialize in these type of mercenary reinforcements. get their experienced opinions on what it would mean is someone could simply \"blow up\" holes and maintain hole control that way. how would it effect their income or style of play. ask someone in aquila if they would likely have been successfully reinforced if the russians could have blown up every hole as it appeared. my experience is my own, but i take a lot in and do fairly well at seeing the bigger picture... but these guys are far more knowledgable then i'll ever be."
"i don't think it is as dramatic as you say. if these bombs never exist, it isn't going to stop fleets from closing holes. you'd still have the chance to reinforce your system; nothing would prevent you. i am assuming that the russians were already offline when you were bringing in the calvalry, so i don't see how this changes anything.at this point, i am leaning towards the 2/5ths + 2 hour solution. the bomb would remove 40% of the wormhole's current total mass allowance and 2 hours of it's life. so, the mass of the wormhole would go like this:100% --- 60% --- 36% --- 21.6% ---12.96% --- 7.776%as you can see, each successive bomb takes less and less mass away from the total. this is zeno's dichotemy paradox. practically, this would mean that 5 bombs would need to be fired at a hole before it goes on the verge of collapse (under 10% total mass). if these bombs are 20 million apiece and the blueprints are rare enough, that would seem about right to me."
"i would like to propose a \"thread-degrading bomb\" which i would launch at this thread, so i could remove it from the forum at no personal risk."
"sad thing of it is...the op is so delusional to think that the reasons \"i want\" \"because i think\" \"i\" \"i\" \"i\" are good enough to think that his idea has a snow balls chance in hell of being considered when its quite obvious its been rejected/refused/trashed... that he keeps going forward regardless.================ stop the evemail spam!"

"so the current customs office rf mechanic is rather silly. the owning corp can't put up any defenses, can't control when the office comes out of rf, and has to pay alot of isk for the thing. my proposal should be a simple change to make owning a customs office a less risky endeavour.1. let us put defenses on it. simply have them activate on agression. that way everyone still can use the office, but if they shoot at it they have to deal with some defense. this will cut down on lone idiots spending hours rfing an office because they want to be dicks.2. either add a stront type bay or allow us to set when we want a customs office to come out of rf. currently if someone outside of our prime attacks the office comes out of rf still in the attackers prime, which limits any sort of defense. on poss we can set rf to come out when we like with good stronting, but with customs offices we have no choice.these 2 changes would bring customs office more in tune with poss and make them more attractive. as it stands, spending about 100m to set up a big bullseye with no defenses or rf control just seems silly."

"not supported.it is my opinion that having to make those choices (and for new players they *can* be difficult choices) are what sets eve apart (read: above) other mmo's. removing learning implants and granting everyone the +5 bonus auto-magically removes one layer of \"choice\" and \"danger\".i honestly don't think (again, imho) that removing implants are going to get people out pvp'ing more - \"people\" as a general rule, will do what they want when they're ready. some guys/gals get in the game and are in 0.0 w/in two weeks, some never make that transition. risk aversion exists before implants.vov(fyi: posting from main )"
"i agree mostly. i agree that removing implants aren't going to increase pvp chancesi agree that people will do what they want when they're ready.i acknowledge that i could get wtfp0wnd in one volley by a toon who's two weeks old depending on what i'm flying.i don't agree that risk aversion exists before implants though.some people know the realities of 0.0 and some don't. some know the realities of pvp and some don't. myself, i know the reality of both, and personally, i don't care to play this game for 0.0 or pvp. i know that i'm going to get dragged into pvp at sometime or another, and i won't have a choice about it at that point, but thats where my \"fun\" comes in. the risk of knowing i have something expensive someone wants to see up on their corp/alliance kb, and then \"expect\" that i'm going to cry about it. come on... its a game... if anyone is going crying over virtual income, they really really need to rethink why they're playing eve and sinking real money into it.i wonder if these same guys who get beat by npc players in civ style games cry when the cpu knocks them on their ass? .. oh.. wait... they just restart the game to avoid \"being beat\"."

"where is the dislike button?"
"to expand on something i posted earlier, since this thread has been necro'd:i'd love to be able to release some of my skill points to remap for something i'm actually using. a lot of people made mistakes early on and wasted a lot of sp figuring out just what we wanted to do in eve. for those of us who have only been around 1-3 years, this can represent a rather large percentage of our skill points. for someone with 20-30 million sp, 2 million makes a big difference. examples.if i want to train a new turret system to level 4 specialization (for t2 guns):small: 390,600 spmedium: 994,410 sp (1,385,010 total)large: 1,641,690 sp (3,026,700 total)with a proper mapping and +4 implants, this will require over 48 days of training. training for a new racial battleship is 678,600 sp, taking 11 days.any given race's cruiser 5 is 1,054,440 sp, requiring almost 17 days.this puts a typical player at needing to spend 2-3 months training to be able to fly a new battleship or t3 with t2 weapons. for someone who has been playing for less than two years, that's a lot of waiting. meanwhile, all the rookie mistakes we made with skills are sitting there being useless.i've made it this far without being able to do these things and don't care whether it's implemented or not, but i don't consider this game-breaking if it's done. i would certainly take a couple of plex out of circulation in order to regain those wasted sp."
"1) this has nothing whatsoever to do with sec status2) what is a good guy? we all kill tens of thousands of people daily. (those rat battleships? thousands of crew.) anyway, sec status isn't a measure of who's good, i can go gank a load of miners, go back home to null and be back in positive standing inside of a day.3) so i take it this is highsec only then? why is that? if i can't have a 'help i'm tackled in the belt' button in nullsec, why should there be one in highsec, where you're rarely at any risk anyway?4) so what? this again has nothing to do with your sec status, and is likely the main use of a button like this."
"i like it, but don't limit sec status. mayday calls drop a beacon that lasts 60 seconds and shows up in the overview, it's basic function is simular to how a cyno behaives in the overview. then anybody and everybody can show up to save you or kill you and the guy attacking you. would be a very interesting thing to have in game.as a measure to prevent abuse, you must be agressing or agressed by another player to call the mayday.mmos come and go, but eve remains. -garresh-"
"i like it (but no sense having sec restrictions.) if you are literally in trouble enough to need to make a wide band plea for help its not like you're going to turn down the help of dodgy pirate types who arrive to pirate your aggressor as (as well)."
"the griefing potential this would provide would be immense"
"1. if you're outside corp's primetime every so often, ok, that's understandable (i.e. weekends because you were on early, or you had a day off or something). if you're constantly playing outside your corp's primetime, sounds like you're in the wrong corp.2. if you're that far from hq so your mates can't show up ... wtf were you doing over there alone?3. as for \"not enough corpies online\" , see #1.4. assuming lowsec ... unless they're blues, anyone who shows up will be more apt to kill the both of you than help."
"i don't see any reason why this idea couldn't be useful and worth the time. i do however disagree with limiting it based on sec status and location. either the ship has a mayday function or it doesn't...period. why wouldn't the system work in wh space for example? we have shared corp bookmarks in wh space and we can warp to each other just fine...pvp works in wh space in the same way it works everywhere else only we don't get the luxury of intel from local.so yeah...ill support it but only if it works the same way everywhere for everybody. yes...even pirates..."
"i don't see a lot of point in this.in nullsec, you can't even trust the guys with high sec status. throwing out an sos just tells them there's easy prey in system.in lowsec, it's always a trap. i wouldn't help anyone there but the guys i'm already in a fleet with.in highsec no one could shoot at them unless they've drawn a criminal flag, in which case concord will be there at least as soon as the first player was able to respond. if they have a legitimate reason to be shooting you, be it war or aggression or kill rights, then the rest of us can't interfere without bringing concord down on ourselves."
"i think what he's meaning is, if someone responds to a sos call, they are already signaling their intention to be a good guy and try and save him so concord would not get involved as long as he's not the aggressing pilot.however, i can see this being abused all over the place, especially in hi sec.for example, someone canflips you and goes red flashy. you shoot him and become the aggressor so he hits the sos button and all of his corp mates come and gank you with ease as concord will turn a blind eye.really don't think this would be a good idea to be honest."
"if it's a replacement for concord: that means i can gank people and then use an alt to respond to the sos, stopping me from losing my ship! love it.if it will allow me to invite people to fights where concord wasn't going to show up: also awesome, i can throw an sos and then when people show up to \"rescue\" my alt, i get a good fight and can use my alt for rr because it's funnier that way.basically if i'm given a mechanic like this, i will abuse the hell out of it to kill the gullible."
"lol...oh! the hilarity that would ensue! now i really approve this idea!it seems a little tweaking of the idea is in order to make it a viable one."
"how would people be notified that there was a mayday call going out? i am imagining someone setting off a smartbomb at the undock in jita and a thousand popups appearing all at once on every single player's screen that is within 3 systems.perhaps it could be something in local and it would appear on the warp to drop-down?it would have to be unobtrusive.of course, someone is going to find a way to grief with this, you know that."
"come to the disco party."
"hahaha... i stand corrected. of course people will grief with this. <--- fixed"
"as an addendum, i would like ccp to revisit the drop tables (or lack thereof) for sleeper and talocan structures.from my experience, destroying sleeper or talocan lco's drops nothing. this is a missed opportunity, and i expect that the pvp crowd would agree. someone trying to blow up a sleeper structure is pretty much a sitting duck for an extended period of time, exactly what gankers would look for.encouraging pve ships to stick around and shoot at the structures gives a little more opportunity to pvp ships that might be lurking. this opportunity does not arise, because there is currently no reason to shoot at a lco in a wormhole. a little more risk, a little more reward... what do you think?"
"in another thread a dev mentioned that ccp was interested in our suggestions on what gameplay should happen in incarna. aside from the features and ideas section of the forum (and who knows what does and doesn't get read in there), i'm wondering how we can make the process more participatory for both sides.maybe do some crowd sourcing for gameplay features? or a survey as part of the next eve newsletter to all players asking them to rate various potential gameplay items for wis?i would like to make this suggestion part of my request to ccp and csmat least this way, ccp can demonstrate player support for the features they include in stations."
"i stopped reading your drivel right there. this is just more elitist garbage spewing forth from a hole that doesn't have a brain behind it to regulate the flow. just because you don't see the value in wis doesn't mean nobody else does. you are probably one of the 95% of nullsec players that pvp solely to pvp. you don't take systems, you don't reinforce stations...you just pvp. it's pointless.see what i did there?fact is ccp had plans for wis to make it more than just walking around. most of you don't know this because you were either too busy crying like little babies to read the information or you are just too blind and stupid to pay attention. now wis is on the backburner because of the sheer number of idiots that play this game and don't like the way everybody else plays it.as for the thread subject...it is likely that we will have to wait until the fanfest to hear any more new news or an update on wis. i would also like to point out that you are requesting an update from ccp devs in assembly hall. they likely will not post in here as they have made it a point not to do so at all. this is a forum for the csm. the only csm i would half expect to reply in this thread with any information of value is trebor."
"my guess is that this thread exists because ccp is ignoring the 56 days old, 1,478 messages long, thread at general discussion. bear in mind that so far the only we've got from the csm is the mittani's hunch that the nex store has been abandoned and nobody wants to think of it."
"ccp only respond on happy post these days and even locks 1 or 2 with normal discussion where they think its an attack on ccp.don,t expect a response on this one also.it only shows the respect ccp has for its customers (when they rabble right ccp?)we know from the past that this is the case"
"no, this thread was a request for the csm to request an update from ccp. essentially i'm trying to use the formal process of the csm to get the clarification we would like.let's see if the wonderful process that is the csm will work.personally, i think the request is reasonable. we're not asking for a particular feature to happen immediately, we're not trying to force largescale changes across eve. all we are wanting is for ccp (via the csm) to talk to us, and respond to our concerns.*crickets*"
"why are you confused? the language is fairly plain.are you looking for something like:\"we will not work on incarna until 2:30 pm december 17th 2012. at that time 3 developers will start working on the platinum skirts and put out new skirts that are biege.\"seriously the company has just redirected resources. if focusing on fis stops the subs from bleeding and even starts to turn things around i'm sure they will continue in that direction. i think ccp will continue to do some things for incarna but it is not going to be all we hear about anymore. those days are hopefully in the past. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"agreed. ccp should have told us their plans for incarna in the first place and the outrage about the nex store wouldn't have happened.ccp seem to have a real problem considering the implications of the changes they make to the game. look at customs offices... the community designed half the features for the new poco system.in fact, most of the stuff in crucible was thought up by the players... looks like you have a pretty good deal here ccp."
"why does my ship auto align to some fictitious point in space.if i stop my ship at 'full stop' - it should stop - aligned to whatever point in space i was moving towards.why does this matter? simple example:try setting up a surprise attack with a cloaked bomber. you cant align properly and wait till the time is right to decloak and throw a couple bombs.currently i align to my target and set my speed to 0.000000000001 so i stay aligned."
"if this was true......and i think it might be...i support it.edit: yes it is...specially if your alinged to a safe spot that is above your \"horizon\" at an obsecne angel and you would only maintain it if your where moving.so yeah....def. want this fixed.just remembered a valid example as to why i thought it was the case...hence my edit.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i recall reading something in a star trek book once that explained the reasoning behind an \"imaginary planar field\" that everybody used to align ships with each other. it was absolutely ubsurd but primarily was done to negate the silliness of ships in space from different races flying at different angles based on how they evolved in their own exploration of space.i do agree with the op to a point. the auto alignment makes our ships in space act like submarines that \"balance\" themselves when stopped after diving or surfacing. on the other hand...seeing ships at all sorts of weird angles in space would feel...odd...kinda like how the new stargate alignment does. it makes sense...but seems odd looking at them compared to what we are used to seeing.i would like to know what determines what is up and what is down for pilots in eve? how was this determined and why doesn't one race fly upside down compared to the others? i guess one could argue it is the plane of a specific solar system that you are in or perhaps the plane of the currently known galaxy...i digress...agreeing with the op.]+1"
"agreed.it is pretty annoying for sb bombing runs in particular to have to maintain a little speed to remain in perfect alignment."

"well done! i could not have been more condescending myself.not sure what to think about this. on one hand, i think it would for sure increase the number of participants, 20k sp (or similar) amount is not exactly the end of the world, and the more people testing the better the test (as it is a stress test) goes. on the other hand, it might, though not *necessarily*, lower the quality of the reports."

"i'm assuming you mean \"in my opinion\". your proposal is based on the idea that \"all people in npc corps aren't also in other corps\". well, maybe that toon isn't, but my hi-sec toons support me (when i need it) - and i haven't lived in hi-sec since nov 2008. i like encouraging people to explore different aspects of the game with carrots - i guess some people (op) only understand the stick...edit to add: not supported"
"as in life, i believe in a mixture of carrot and stick. so far we have seen only carrot, as those affected by any stick threaten to unsubscribe (which never happens). i understand how you may all view this as being simply my opinion, as you will all be affected by it, though i believe it will objectively increase the \"quality\" of the game for everyone.to expand on this, it is necessary to define \"quality\". each player feels that different game aspects offer different levels of enjoyment, so will measure quality in different ways. however for the purposes of this idea i will define quality as \"fun\". fun is an enjoyment of playing the game, and taking part in it's various offerings and interactions - the constantly changing variety and fresh challenges.i contest that the actions of those who never leave npc corps is not fun, as their range of activities is limited, and generally will always be closer to a mundane \"grind\" that simply earns money as fast as possible. this is closer to an addiction or chore than \"fun\" in the true sense, therefore is of a lower quality of game play. someone must take responsibility for the people \"stuck\" in this manner, and if no amount of carrot will remedy the situation, it is my belief that a tiny stick should be employed. i also believe this will not cause a mass unsubscribing, as the introduction of mandatory 10% npc corp tax did not. it would also be arguable therefore that ccp could employ \"salami tactics\", such as introducing a similar 10% increase every two years, with minimal protest from the community.this is not about killmails. it is about a worrying disconnect i feel with this mass of players, who it seems are playing a different game to me, and who i cannot interact with. their ships may as well be a background animation, flowing through hisec gates and making the universe appear more alive.i myself have a high sec alt, and wouldn't mind this change. in reality it does nothing to impede game play; players may simply join a player corp to avoid the tax."
"there's a reason for that, it is just your opinion. the point remains that forcing people to do stuff is a bad idea. /thread"
"aww, are you lonely? maybe you should send them isk. then you will have friends.btw, i now crown you the boss of what eve is all about, and how everyone else should play their internet spaceship game."
"you believe?you contest?you think?you____?funny.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"lot of hostility and cynicism here. i am starting to understand now what hulkageddon is about... the perpetrators probably tried to reach out but have given up.you all react as though i am asking for all of empire space to become nullsec. that would be ridiculous. all i am saying is, there should be a balance of risk/reward. there should be a greater cost for what is essentially invincibility. it feels like what i am proposing is the stick, because the only way this can be adusted is in that direction. after ccp made it possible to grind cash from an npc corp until the top 1b+ ships can be afforded, there is no \"better\" or more expensive ships that can be accessed only in player corp activities/ lowsec/ nullsec/ hisec. so if we are to rebalance risk & reward, our only two options are, the \"carrot\" which is providing an entire new line of super-expensive and powerful \"end-game\" ships (more tech 3 maybe?) which is only accessible by taking on more risk - or the \"stick\" which makes existing ships harder to access by \"the invincible\".one is the carrot as it provides new stuff, the other is the stick as it \"removes\" stuff.my concern is for those in npc corps who have ground to the absolute end game with nowhere to go. in my view (one shared by ccp, in fact, if you read the devblog announcing 10% npc corp tax) this grind should be the beginning of one's eve experience, not the end. there is such a wonderful game world to experience, and many of you are essentially playing x3: beyond the frontier."
"ganking a hulk in a catalyst has risk?btw, where do minerals and mods come from? where do you get your ships from? and they're not \"interacting\" with you? back in the days, you had to mine your own minerals and build your own ships. good times."
"you should be asking what the #### does hulkageddon have to do with being in an npc corporation? i suspect he's getting desperate now.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i laid something like this out about a week ago in another thread. i definitely approve of driving people out of hiding in npc corps.neutrals are probably the biggest contributors to the highsec isk fountain. if we could make it unprofitable to operate bots and long-term grinding alts in npc corps, we at least would be moving them into corps where they could be war targets."
"not everyone is a bot floppie....until you get past that bit...no one will win this fight.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"read again. the issue isn't just bots, it's that anyone can operate an npc corp alt for money-making and be virtually immune to attempts to reduce their cash flow. it lets them run missions in utter safety, then send that cash to their main character to be spent doing whatever it is you're trying to keep them from doing.i briefly considered the idea of simply making it cost-prohibitive to transfer money from an npc character to another, but that's easily circumvented. so the only real solution is reducing their ability to make money while in npc corps.also, here's where i suggested this, with a lot fewer words:"
"can't believe no one sees what will happen if this idea went live:a bunch of single-digit-membership alt corps with 0% tax. war-dec'd ? make another for less than the war dec cost. what is you plan to deal with this so you can force people out of the npc corps? also, as stated, eventually this 'idea' would get people to 100% tax rate in npc corps. thats legit, yo.flaws aside, this idea is still awful."
"easily my favorite line in this entire thread, lol.and he's right. if you force people out of npc corps they still won't comply with your wishes, they will still do everything in their power to avoid you.this entire thread is nothing more than a big huge \"my idea of a sandbox is more important than your idea of a sandbox\" whine. you can't force people to play the way you want them to and you can't force them to interact if they don't want to. get over it."
"you raise a good point about the one man corps. i don't think such an exploit would matter though, as if people leave the npc corp to make their own single digit corp, they have still increased their risk, and so still deserve the reward of 0% tax they would receive. i do not think npc corps should end at 100% tax, that's silly. perhaps 40% should be highest for example. and maybe a slower increase, 1% a week. like i said in the op, i am open to ideas for the actual numbers.anyone reading most of the replies in this thread would think the op says \"turn empire space into nullsec so i can kill whoever i want\" when in fact it is a measured and reasonable approach to redressing hyper-inflation, risk vs reward, the devaluation of most items, and everyone having now \"completed\" eve as we wait for ccp to supply a new end game."
"so make it more difficult to close one corp and open another, and put a cap on npc corp taxes so that it's reduced income, not completely removed. the idea is to make sitting in npc corps less desirable.another idea might be to add hostility between npc corps so that rival corps won't all you to dock in their stations or give you access to their agents. if npc corp characters were only welcome in their corp's native empire space (meaning they can't use agents elsewhere) and had rival corps in that space that would deny them docking privileges, it might become enough of an annoyance that they leave the npc corp."
"surely if someone wants to subscribe to eve and pays their money each month as you do, they can stay in a npc corp if they want to. what gives you or anyone else in this thread the right to dictate how someone else plays the game?if someone wishes to remain non-affiliated to any corp or alliance in eve then that is their right to do so.remember, not everyone in a npc corp is there to avoid wardecs. there are plenty of reasons as to why a character is there, most notable being null sec alts for logistic purposes. they don't run missions for the most part so an increasing tax rate would not affect them at all.i will not support any suggestion that impinges on someone else's ability to play the game their way."
"have to agree with mr. menance...floppie you bring up a valid point but the fact remains...we have no right to force anyone to play this game any differently than we would expect you fine gents to do so.and the excuse of stopping bots isn't going to fly either...because obviously not everyone is a bot.....yes everyone here has high sec alts....so its shooting yourself in the foot.there are ways to take them out...even if they aren't convient as a war dec.================ stop the evemail spam!"

"not really. it would be just the same if they were in their own corp. most of the hi sec griefers that dec large null sec alliances wouldn't waste their time trying to work out which one man corp belonged to a null sec toon.i know my logistics toon is in a npc corp just because i couldn't be bothered with setting up a corp when it wasn't and still isn't necessary.this is not my main either and is in a 1 man corp but i do run missions on this toon and various other things but that is my choice. no-one forced this on me and that's exactly what's being proposed by this suggestion. imposition on a select part of the eve community to conform to someone else's idea of what they should be doing.don't agree with that and never will."
"what he said."
"this."
"silly and cliche'd idea.aside from that in case you missed the recent newsflash:eve's subscription numbers did dropfield of trolls: \"if you chum it, they will come.\""
"ccp dictates how we play the game every second we're playing it. concord? that's telling me i can't shoot your ship when i want to. how dare they not let me play my way.what we're suggesting here is a look at a way to stop the abuse of the npc corps without forcing people out of them. alliance supply lines are largely untouchable because they can be maintained from inside npc corps. isk faucets such as mission, mining, and incursion alts can all be protected inside npc corps. people pay a paltry corp tax for absolute immunity to the movements the corporate world of eve.as i said, i'm open to other ideas such as restricting access for npc corps to their own empires. create a more robust background of lore regarding the corporations and their relationships and then use that lore to create restrictions that fit within the game universe and give it more depth. if you wanted to make it really interesting, occasionally shift those relationships along with news articles about various corporate contracts and summit meetings and such...meaning that if you're living in an npc corp, your ability to do business may be suddenly cut off as your employer's status changes.as it stands you can be employed by a gallente npc corporation and run missions for the caldari navy in which you shoot federation ships. i'm pretty sure the caldari would never hire someone who worked for their rivals.for the time being. all rights may be revoked by ccp at any time. yeah, i'd like to see those shoved out and forced to reside in player corps where they were vulnerable to wardecs for the purpose of interfering with supply lines, but i don't know a good way to do that. though my idea of docking restrictions does make it harder to run npc corp hauler alts."
"you really should've quoted my whole post.null sec alt's for logistics wouldn't bat an eyelid at being 'forced' out of a npc corp. they will just make a 1 man corp and carry on their merry way. how are you ever going to know they were an alt for a specific corp/alliance? also as i previously stated, logi alts rarely run missions so again a tax rate increase wouldn't affect them so it still wouldn't work for that specific purpose.yeah ccp dictates how we play their game. not you, not anyone else that decides how others will play the game.docking restrictions would limit a lot of the game for a lot of people.well i am sorry to say but there are people that only like to run missions/mine/plex/do pi/manufacturing without being wardec'd by griefer corps every other minute. that's how they want to play then that is fine by me.how about you and all the griefers move to low/null then you can shoot at anyone you want and leave the npc corp people alone? why is this even an issue for anyone is beyond me unless you are quite happy in hi sec griefing people that can't or won't shoot back?only trouble there is, the people in null will shoot back and are likely to have a lot more friends than you do.again, this just smacks of 'i want you to play the game my way'. oh and the part about npc restrictions? there's already a game mechanic for that. shoot gallente navy ships for caldari missions (for example) then you take a standing hit to gallents and vice versa. think that is working as intended.one thing that may help this situation, full on, no holds barred war between the 4 factions in eve. be a gal toon in cal space and you can and will get attacked, something like that would be cool.the big boys have been too friendly for too long now....we want war!!!"
"ugh... you don't get it. right now, there's a risk in closing holes. you need to jump through and there's the risk that company on the other side keeps you from jumping back. this risk is necessary for wormhole ops to take place. there needs to be the chance for hole control to be wrestled from one side or the other. you're bombs idea... fails. someone knocks the hole to second crit with no risk... now it's impossible for a fleet to get through to reinforce allies or whatever. this cripples wormholes ops and is an embarassingly bad idea."
"i really don't care about reinforcements. that isn't even a factor i'm considering."
"nope...you just want the \"i win\" bomb in dealing with uninvited guests and closing down wormholes.be honest now.traditional methods are too expensive/too risky for you to deal with.you couldn't care less about reality or the facts concerning large scale operations let alone game mechanics.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"this is why you fail. there's a hell of a lot more going on in the game than what you alone care about."
"so, we're back to these bombs being insta-win in your opinion? well the problem is that you and ingvar angst now disagree, because he says that these bombs would help the invaders, and you are saying that these bombs would help the defenders against the uninvited guests.you two disagree on who it would be beneficial for.the re-occurrence over and over in your posts about reinforcements tell me that this is a very important issue to you. i do understand that as a part of a corp that was rescued when invaders came into your system, you'd be sensitive about anything that would disrupt your sense of security. i expect you see this proposal as an assault on the mechanics that give you that security. i can respect that motivation, but i simply disagree that it should be a determining factor. i would quote back to you your own sentiment; \"there is a hell of a lot more going on in the game than what you alone care about\".from all of the resistance i've seen to this idea, i hope that everyone can just relax and rest assured that no matter how long this thread gets, this idea probably won't be something ccp will adopt. i think it is a good idea, and i'm amused by the discourse we're having, but i don't honestly expect this to come out in the next patch. so, just ease back... there's no need for people to get their blood pressure up. it is a conversation on a topic we disagree about."
"but that's just it... no one cares that you don't care. many do. your bad idea would result in people losing their systems with no hopes of being able to fight back. you turn wormhole assaults into carebear adventures with minimal repercussions. i've been involved with both ends of the spectrum... system assaults and defenses. you have no clue how much of the game you'd break simply because you want a lazy way to blow up holes.we can agree on one thing... ccp wouldn't damage their game this way, so there should be no threat of seeing something this ridiculous ever implemented."
"it already is and always will be simply because the players will find a way to make it trivial."
"currently there's risk. you actually have to go through the wormhole, many times, to close it. these bombs remove the risk by allowing somone to stay on one side only and reduce the hole to the point it's unusable. wormholes are about the risk. we don't need crap like this making them safer."
"wrongdead wrong.learn to think before you type.i completely agree with ingvar. (even if i come across as somenoe standing on my own..its only becasue i'm not in his realm of knowledge...he's likely on a whole different level of epxertise..but what he says..makes sense...i'm sitting here appluading every time he posts as it is)its a two way street when it comes to whs defense or offense.his explinations and arguments are in concert with mine.reinforcments being denied is no different than the oposistion denying access to their own hole.for you to fail to pick up on that...is just even more evidence that you have utterly no clue what your talking about.again..in case your blind and not just failing to rationlize...i agree with him..completely.he's only entertaining the idea for as long as the balance of whs offense/defense is not disuprted in all areas...including large alliances/corporations..an area you refuse to factor in.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i agree with drake on this one.what you propose is a double edged sword and more likely to be used for wh denial than anything else.it will make wh's nice, safe and cosy for the people already there. that is just so wrong so no way i can support this one."
"i agree with this, drake. denying reinforcements is the same as denying people access to your hole. i am totally with you. these devices are used to degrade holes without bias, they don't exclusively work for invaders, or defenders.the issue i think that ingvar angst sees is that he had a very close call. his group could have been ousted from a system they were really invested in. he is imagining the russians lobbing wormhole degrading bombs at the holes instead of having to fly their big logi-orca through them. the orca was the lynchpin to them saving their system, because once they blew that up, they could keep the holes open and get people to fly to their rescue. i do get where he's coming from. there are so many topics i want to address, i have to revert to bullet points. the russians were on in their time zones, and were asleep enough at the wheel (literally and figuratively) so that aquilla could bump their dreds out of the pos and blow them up. now, if you have the time to bump an opposing fleet out of their pos, you have time to close a wormhole or explore to try and get reinforcements in. the only time the russians were doing anything was when they were online and active, and whether or not they had bombs, that's how it was. if the invaders of a hole have to use these devices, they will need to be flying a sb. sb's can be destroyed much easier than orcas or tengus. the aquilla incident did involve a russian orca, but without a pos or an orca, you're not changing ships in a wormhole. this means that you're stuck in the sb. these devices would cost a lot. they are a guaranteed loss. i've been saying around 20 million isk, and i think that's a good starting point. 20 million per shot. you can either fire off 10 or 11 of these things or you can buy a tengu hull at the same price. the cost might not matter to big alliances who replace their lost supercaps with a yawn, but very soon it will be obvious that this bomb is a convenience, not a replacement for jumping back and forth through the hole. this."
"do you actually put any thought into your argumetns or are you just trolling for grandstanding purposes?you just single handedly made yourself look completely and utterly wrong and yet at the same time came up with some sort of copout to make your proposal seem... (reaching)... to have some sort of validatiy.who gives a flying crap if russians use sb's or not...point is...we will use whatever tool (cheap...efficient) at our means to deny or grant access to whs.your bomb is niether.its a too easy \"i win' button to close holes or deny access or \"just because\" excuse that can easily be sorted by any ship with a ton of armor plates for the same price.you keep diluteing your excuses into one simple concept that you refuse to ackwnoeldge.this is all simlpy \"because i want it and its right as such\"we dont need it or want it...thank you very much.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"posting in an obscure thread on an eve forum is hardly grandstanding. besides, this thread has been at least 90% negative towards this idea - if i am anything it is a glutton for punishment.neither cheap nor efficient? if that is true, why do you call it an \"i win\" button? your standards may be different than mine, but if i was going to design an \"i win\" button, it would be effective. drake, you are assuming that i am pushing this idea because i want them for my own use. i don't need to use these bombs, and if i had them i would probably save them until i had a really good reason to use them. i know how to degrade wormholes, and i am perfectly happy to let the dangerous ones expire naturally. if ccp came to me and said \"we have decided to make your wh bombs, but you and your alts will never be able to use them\", i would still support the idea - it's not about me at all.you can keep insulting me, and deriding me and trying to provoke me into acting like you do, but when you do that, the messages i see are: \"i can't compete so i am going to try and hurt you\" and \"i'm not mature enough to have this discussion\". you aren't hurting my feelings, you're just making yourself look bad. we can disagree with each other without being petulant."

"don't get me wrong...i love the new forums but the \"we've been ganked!\" page is not only annoying to look at but irritating in how often it occurs. it is bad enough that i have had to get into the habit of copying every post i make just in case."

"so i took it upon myself to update my corp's fittings because it had old fits from a past alliance which is now dead. i wanted to also add in new fits from new alliance doctrines, implement a standardized naming convention for the fits, and also input fits from plain text online. to do this, one would assume that it'd be easiest to export fits, edit the xml, then re-import them. however, this took me over two hours to do. the xml editing was just fine, but importing was a huge pain...first, one cannot import a fitting xml sheet to their corporation list (even with proper roles.) instead, they import to your personal fits (of which we only have 100.) then, when importing, if there are errors in the module names it'll still import other ships instead of making you fix everything first. this resulted in a ton of duplicates which needed removing to make space for fixed fits. after that, i found out that the bloody import mechanism didn't even import every ship every time. it imported about 60-70% the first time, and then i had to delete those fits from the xml sheet and reimport, bringing in anywhere from 20-50% of the remaining ships. i think after about 10-15 different imports i finally imported all of the corp fits, and i lost most of my own personal fits because i couldn't think of a good way to keep corp and personal fits separate during the import. this is just pathetic.so, to put it plainly, these are things that need/should to be fixed in the corporation fitting management interface: import to corporation fittings don't import if errors don't import duplicates import every fit in a document in one shot remove fits from personal list when setting as corporation fit (but not the other way around) before anyone asks, this is an alt, and any grammar/typographical/other errors are due to habits, it being almost 5am and me being sick."

"i actually have to agree that removing the learning skills from the game was to the betterment of the game and the new player. it took months to train those skills and even though a lot of us suffered through it, it was a major detractor to the game from a new player perspective. now that those have been removed, everyone begins the game with what was once considered \"max learning skills\". however, i fail to see a logical argument as to why learning implants should be removed. i've seen a lot of posts here but as of yet still haven't seen anything valid. i've certainly seen no flaw in the game mechanics presented. i honestly don't see any new players being awed into the game just because learning implants have gone away. every single \"new player\" i've known in this game that has quit eve, has quit for reasons relating to highsec. things relating to the lack of mission variety. mining is boring. things along those lines. i have never heard someone say they quit the game in the first month because i trained faster than they did. i have however, seen quite a few older players e-rage in local because they got podded and their implants are on a killmail now."
"you don't like crayons ?"
"fear of podding (due to loss of implants) is a major reason why noobs are afraid to leave high-sec. they can easily change to a cheap ship but can't change to a cheap clone because they don't have jumpclones. and as a noob, learning faster is really appealing so they'll try to get the best implants they can as soon as possible. arguing that this mechanic is not especially bad for new players is a rather narrow-minded position. and yes, noobs have implants from day one if they do their tutorial missions, which they should."
"everything that could be said about learning skills could be said about implants.look, somebody is doing is right above me. \"you must train as fast as possible and that is an inconvenience because xyz, so give noobs skills/implants for free\"."

"say guys, if there was a shorter, 4h or something, timer for clone jumping within the same station, would it solve the issue with wrong hardwiring + learning implants?well, just throwing some ideas here. not sure this is a good one. it's still like trying to have the best of both worlds, low risk and high reward.:sand: over :awesome:"
"if you're going down that route, you might as well allow implants to be plugged out without being destroyed. jumpclones were meant to be as a means of travel to save pilots the excruciating 50 jumps back to empire, not as implant switching method."
"must have some delay, otherwise having perfect hardwiring for your fittings become kinda mandatory in small scale encounters.:sand: over :awesome:"
"do you have a source for this claim?anway what does it matter what the original intent was? i'm sure many things in this game work out ok even if they are not used as intended. edit: this seems like a less disruptive option than simply removing all learning implants from the game. if the only objection to it was the functional fixedness one expressed above then i think it would be a contender. sadly i think there are other problems with reducing the timer to 4 hours.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"i'm not sure if it was ever explicitly said by ccp, but it's a fairly safe assumption if you know a bit of eve history.it was the response to people self-destructing their pods so they could reach their destination more quickly. it was common practice back then. it seems silly today, but warp to zero, jump bridges, capital ships, covert cloaks didn't exist and traveling through 0.0 was slow and painful. red moon rising introduced jump clones as means of 'rapid fleet deployment'. implant switching was probably an unintended but acceptable side-effect.on a different note, it is well worth remembering how old eve is and how much it has changed. some things just don't make much sense in today's eve and others never did. not everybody realizes this, instead making the assumption that everything is working as intended and makes sense.i would also support removal of attributes entirely for that matter, replacing it with a fixed sp/day. the attribute system we have seems like it was originally intended to promote uniqueness between characters but it just doesn't work out. eve has evolved along a totally different path. all it does nowadays is reward year-long remaps and inflexibility."
"you see, there is only one reason left why i don't support the complete removal of attributes (which is way more radical than the thread op): there are a lot of people out there that wants more options to actively influence how fast their skill training goes.there is some truth in these claims. after all it is your toon and you should be able to control him to be better at what you want him to (skill training, in this case).but that may also be a reflex of people who played too much traditional rpg and mmo, where you are supposed to make insane ammounts of grinding to become high level.but we are getting off-topic here. the thread is about how the implants end up excluding people from the pvp content in the long run, even if they don't realize it and even if it was due their decisions all along.:sand: over :awesome:"
"this is just silly...you want a jumpclone? then get your standings up. no mmo should offer everything to you at once, in every mmo you have to grind in some way. in this case, you grind your standing up to get a jumpclone. there are also other alternatives to getting jumpclones. any null sec group worth their salt should have a rorq that will provide you with a jumpclone without the standings issue. it seems to me that you guys want to go from a-z by skipping the rest of the alphabet. video games and especially rpgs are about becoming stronger/working towards a better all around toon. hell, even first person shooters are this way nowadays. (bf3, modern warfare) seriously....if you don't want to actually play the game and want to be all powerful from the start, then why bother?"
"is this a joke? you been playing eve for two days?get a jumpclone, there, problem solved. otherwise stay the heck out of null or risk it. you try to not fail, have a proper scout and not get podded. spent lots of time flying around 6v in crystals mind you and never got podded once. we always had a scout and alternative warp to avoid bubbles. try to fail alil less and this wont be such a problem."

"this all comes back to flying in what you can afford to lose. can't afford to get podded w/ +5's in your head? use +4's. can't afford to lose that bhaalgorn you just bought? stick with the geddon. you choose what you fly, how you fly it, and who you fly it with. there is no game mechanic flaw with learning implants, the only flaw is how people fly. and noobs really have no reason to be flying around with expensive implants. the average skill train time for a new player is probably around a day for the first month or two, the bonus that the implants would give wouldn't even be that effective. and when the implants would become useful the pilot should be reaching a point where they can afford them better. especially if they are in a good corp. as a few others have posted before me, you want to fix the problem of losing implants jump into a different clone or learn to fly better. neither are very difficult."
"learning implants promote new players to work in the game to get better implants or it promotes them to load up the eve website and buy plex. either way, its good for eve."
"forum alts: i kind of agree with our goon friend. my posts would yield no credence had i used an alt. i think i raised some good points and addressed the op thoroughly. that<U+FFFD>s all i<U+FFFD>ll say on that one.older players: eve should, and has been designed to, favor older players. it is a given. that said, life should not be made too difficult to new players. they should not have nearly the benefits that older players enjoy, but this is a game and should be fun regardless of character age.pvp entry: while removal of learning implants may persuade a few players to pvp, i don<U+FFFD>t think this would affect the majority of players. the loss of other implants, modules, and ships are also considerations. honestly, i think you would be surprised how few payers have +5s and still do not engage in pvp."

"thank you very much for your responses guys, some constructive, some not very, thank you non-the-less. negative result is a result too. what i would like to point out is that there seems to be bias in terms of what kind of people surf the forums. in other words, people who mainly surf the forum are th veterans who do not want this change to happen, whereas most of the people with whom i spoke with and who wanted the change were more or less rookies. and rookies initially rarelly crawl through the forums - hence this group is underrepresented."
"the issue in your logic is that you assume the rookies understand the game as well as the older players. rookies rarely actually understand most of the core philosophies of eve. they are still expecting eve to be a cookie cutter mmo like all the other ones they've played. but eve is a dark and dangerous place where there are consequences to your actions. older players usually appreciate that part of the eve design philosophy and don't want to throw that away simply because some noobs feel like it should be easier."
"well yes and no, i certainly agree and fully support the core philosophy of eve, and i think its beautiful.however what i'm trying to say here is that people object for wrong reasons. introducing plex for remap does not necesserally make eve easier, its still same mechanics at the core. i'm arguing that people object because of \"selfisheness\""
"selfishness? your wanting an real money solution to a problem concerning the choices you make in game.learn to live with them or get out...its that simple.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"a) they don'tb) it wouldn't matter to a well constructed argument whether they did or notand the thing about the whole \"only a minority read the forum\" - yeah, that minority being those that are (relatively) informed and actually care about the game.remaps are a arguably necessary evil. plex are a necessary evil. opening one up for free use with the other is a terrible idea."
"here is my idea for bounty1. pilot 1 wants to put a bounty on the mark.2. pilot 1 enters the reward amount and pays a fee for keeping the bounty open for x period of time, which would be calculated relative to the bounty reward amount.(this should get exponentially higher according to bounty value) 3. the mark is notified of the bounty and then is told <U+FFFD>in the event you are pod-killed by a pilot registered to collect your bounty <U+FFFD> a fee equivalent to the bounty reward will be charged to use your clones regardless of who provides the service, including your own services. if you are pod-killed by a pilot not registered with the bounty office. a fee will not be charged for using you clones and the bounty will still stand.4. pilots wishing to collect a bounty must register with the bounty office before killing the mark.5. the mark can approach the bounty office and pay a fee equal to 80% of the bounty placed on them to have the bounty nullified.these changes create a large risk in being pod killed, for if you do not have the isk equivalent to the amount it would cost to use a clone <U+FFFD> you would have all your isk taken from you. (unless you are killed by someone not registered with the bounty office.)also if the mark gets someone they know to pod-kill them to collect the bounty. this would only serve to remove the bounty only, because there would still be a cost incurred to the mark when activating their clone. the mark could never be sure if the person they have asked to pod-kill them, will hand over the money to pay for the clone fee.as for concord placing a bounty fees do not apply for using clones when killed.also provide away for players to tag ships and follow them through gates... but limit it to detectable within 3 jumps or so, also provide a time limit on the tag, so eg. if its been 30minutes the tag no longer broadcasts. this should also show where a tagged ship is docked this ability should only be given to pilots currently registered with the bounty office. have skills/equipment associated. (greater the skill level higher the chance of detection)have skills/equipment associated to stop the detection of tags.that is"
"@op ah cool. we basically had the same idea ("
"you can simply substract it (see"
"i think part of the problem is that ccp did discuss their plans for incarna. they demonstrated a working multiplayer environment. they talked about the wonderful tech underlying it. they talked about how boosters would be traded in bars, how players could rent out shops.and then we got a single room."
"smokes and mirrors, marketspeak, demomode. please don't tell me you believed that manure they shoveled around, especially when 'walking in stations' was a buzzword even years ago.you may be missing the point that we got a single room and the nex store, and i think without the nex store we wouldn't have cq either. and i presume i don't need to explain what the motives behind the nex store were."
"the point of this thread is to ask the csm to request ccp as to the future of incarna."
"ccp's exact prioritization for the next couple of expansions is still up in the air, but it will focus heavily on fis work. there may be some more information in the summit minutes about manpower allocations, but i can't go into more details at present."
"called it! thanks trebor. i think frankly most of us want to see work continue and focus on fis but we also want to see the completion of wis. frankly i could care less how ccp allocates manpower...that is their business not the players. so long as they get the work done efficiently and correctly with fewer bugs and less delay.lets wait for the summit minutes and go from there. i honestly think we won't see any real information on wis until fanfest though. if we get some new info from the summit that will be nice."
"because, just going to the effing wis thread and say \"we're still thinking about it, bear with us\" would be so difficult..."
"thanks for the responsebut still can,t understand why they keep quit ,even after more and more people are asking for infowe are not demanding anything or go to jita to blast some statue (that,s for 0.0 alts ,who fly in systems with a too big alliance and are bored) ,at least not now j/k"
"what trebor said should be obvious to anyone who has read the recent dev blogs and what ccp's ceo said. how frequently do they need to repeat it? every 2 months? make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"nothing to repeat we know that fis got priority now ,but a lot want wis and are hoping its not on the shelves foreverthat's all we want to know ,everything they possibly could give on info about wis"
"they already gave all the info they have on wis up to right now."
"yes? ok tell me then ,were the tq,s the only room s they were working on,was or had they more in the pipeline to finish what are their expectations regarding wis,do they think they will be able to pick it from the selves againagain not demanding more wis right now ,but want to know if there could be more later"
"thanks for your response trebor.i think the main thing that we would like communicated to ccp, is that there is indeed support for the original vision of wis but that it should not be confused with support for the current state of incarna. nor are we asking that it take any particular priority (though similar to any feature in eve we would like it to recieve serious developer time at some point).i know that the summit has already occured, and that incarna did not feature highly in those discussions. personally i think it creates the impressions that ccp is abandoning the feature. i'm not sure why ccp won't clarify their plans for this feature over the next year.can you formally request that ccp respond to the issues raised in this thread and those in the 75 page thread in general discussion.we've been playing the 'wait and see' game with incarna for years, enough is enough already."
"what drives me nuts is how this silence does nothing for ccp and is unnecessarily bothering people. i even pondered the chances of taking the matter to the press..."
"any previous plans for wis will have been greatly hampered by the fact that incarna showed the technology behind it to be a buggy, resource hogging, graphics card- frying piece of crap."

"i agree with this.i look at hi sec as the western nations. all nice, cosy and you can live in relative peace but you can still be murdered in the street. cops then appear and punish the criminal(s).low sec is more like developing countries. still reasonably safe as long as you know what you are doing but be in the wrong place at the wrong time and you are toast. cops are ineffectual here, just like the real world.null, well that's the somalia of eve to be honest. everything goes and don't even think of looking for help from a cop. i think wardec's do need to be looked at again. they don't seem to be doing the job they were designed for. hi sec should be safer than low or null but not a total pvp free zone either.i actually think npc corps should be allowed to be dec'd. it's just a corp like any other. maybe even allow the faction that runs the npc corp to help out as well. just means you will have a million noobs in frigs to deal with to kill the guy your after.or how about taking a contract out on someone? assassination would be cool. just make sure it costs a fortune otherwise everyone and their brother will be assassinating everyone! after all we've already got the 'terrorists' suicide ganking everything, why not assassins?just some thoughts that may make life in hi sec interesting. they may be bad, they may be good. make of them what you will. i still don't agree with forcing people out of npc corps though."

"because it is a good idea. it doesn't have to personally benefit me for me to advocate for it."
"i think it's been fairly well demonstrated that this is nothing resembling a good idea. it's a nerf. i makes dangerous space safer. it makes wormhole ops safer. this is inherently a bad thing. when you remove the risk from wormholes, you remove their heart. even running pi should come with inherent risk. with these damnable bombs, all someone has to do is blow their static down to second crit and they're pretty well fully safe to do what they want.you create risk-free wormhole living. as a long time wormhole resident, i cannot stress enough how much i disagree with this."
"my current ideas on how these bombs should work: bomb flight time should be 10 seconds. bomb speed should be 1.5k/sec. bomb area of effect should be 500m (radius) bomb must be launched from a bomb launcher ii bomb volume = 95m3 bomb armor hp = 240 bomb structure hp = 50 bombs would be banned in empire space (like all bombs) bomb wormhole mass multiplier = .4 bomb lifetime modifier = -7200 seconds blueprint originals would not be available on the market blueprint copies would spawn in random stations.in order to fire these devices, a pilot will need to have bomb deployment v. the pilot would need to be in a stealth bomber fitted with a bomb launcher ii. the size of these bombs (95m3) would mean that a maximum of 3 could be carried by any race's stealth bomber. the pilot would have to align to the wormhole and deploy the device between 15,499m and 14,501m for it to affect the wormhole at all. this deployment zone puts them within targeting/warp disruption range of people camping the hole. the bomb would be slow moving once fired, traveling at half the speed of current bombs. they would have no resistances to any damage type. obviously this means that they could be shot down.i had mentioned earlier that if the bomber had to remain on grid for the bomb to have an effect, that would add exposure. i'm not sure if this fits within the current game code, though. if there was some measure that could be put in place to make it a little riskier, i think it would be more acceptable.i doubt that these bombs would be used with any regularity, considering their expense and risk relative to my proposed effect. it gets expensive too quickly. but, in specific circumstances, where the tactical advantage outweighed the cost, i can see them used to great effect."
"well actually it'd be interesting to see if there are any pi bots out there that's how we could tell if it's too difficult for them to doi don't think bots are complicated enough to handle the little probing mini game the problem with grav sites is that they stay around too long someone can probe it out, bookmark it, and have their regular mining bot run it all dayreplace belts with small grav sites that deplete in 2-3 hours of mining at whatever rate people normally mine belts in highsecalso if you think the probing mini game is too hard for noobs then put some veldspar only belts in the starter areas until they go through the probing tutorial or better yet make them learn to probe before they can minei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"i don't think the pi model is applicable i'd concur with some of your thoughts here and it's something i've given a little thought to myselfnow assuming the forum doesn't eat my post yet againi think any change needs to start from first principles belts are celestial objects and they move now modelling a whole load of roids all moving at different velocities would be a nightmare so we need to simplify thingsa system can spawn a number of belts per day with a total number of roids pretty much as at the moment except they dont all spawn at once (except in starter systems which remain exactly as they currently are)for all other systems roids spawn in segments of say 5-10 roids and they a segment only spawns when scanned for now before i go further then mechanics for existing grav sites remain unalteredfor every thing else there are 2 classes of belt segments, basic and enhancedbasic segments only spawn the 2 base types of ore for that sec level/region and only the base yield typesenhanced segments can spawn all the ore types for that sec level/region and both base and high yield typesbase segments can be picked up with a normal ship scanner, enhanced segments require the use of core probes(always 100% chance of detection on single scan)both base and enhanced type segments are *moving* with a velocity of (say) between 50m/s and 120m/s the base types have the higher speed making them more condusive to mining with frigates/cruisers or ab fitted barges/exhumersso you now have to keep up with your roids to mine themnot only that when you bookmark a segment after scanning for it when you jump to it it will be moving and moving away from you so you now have to catch up, and keep up note this also applies when warping to somebody who's already in the belt (current game mechanic of warping to somebody who's moving) if the segment has moved more than 200km by the time you arrive you arrive in empty spaceroids are only removed from a belt's segment list if they're mined out, otherwise they appear when scanned for until the list is exhaustedfuther changes to some sort of interactive model require more thought, and would at least require additional mid slots on barges/exhumers and should mandate the use of a survey scanner to make any interactive model worth while, some form of structure modelling for each roid would be required however, this has an upside who says all roids are solid? perhaps they contain voids? perhaps hitting a void automatically shuts down a stripminer? who says all voids are hollow? perhaps they contain another ore type, or worthless rock, or ice, or even gas? the gas may not be inert, or it may be under pressure; after all blowouts are a major problem to the oil industry"
"i agree that such massive concernted efforts should be required if you \"really\" want to catch that damn covert ops ship or cloaky hauler.but do you agree that battleships, t1 industrials, command ships, battlecruisers and every single sub-cap class ship in the game should be immune to all but these enormous well planned gate camps too? because that's what frag warping is, it's complete immunity to effectively all camps for effectively all ships.which is also why i get so confused that people don't use it more often :)but anyway, yeah, people shouldn't have to spend hours dropping drones around a gate (at the risk of ccp coming and popping them anyway if they use too many) just so they can solo gatecamp and catch a dominix with a tech one cloak and a mwd.(as for \"cover the gate in smartbombing battleships\", rofl. not a fan of small gang pvp i take it?)[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"

"sure, i'll try again, nooblet.you ever (try) to kill a bs, fitted or otherwise with 1, 2 or maybe 3, if you're lucky smartbombing bs?it still does not solve the crappy, near exploit mechanic you so desperate try to maintain."
"1) not if you use an alt2) sit a rohk on a gate, at the right distance in the direction of the outgate. then watch for incoming cloakies, and smartbomb them to hell as they land. doesn't fix frag warping though, so i think drake misunderstood you when he pointed this out.unless he means you need enough smartbombing battleships to instapop that pesky dominix :d i don't know why, but something is telling me from the last few posts that drake doesn't actually know what frag warping is :([center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"1) not really practical, imo. even with the extended radius because of the drones, you still going to need 30-40 ships with drones out to prevent any cloaks from working. (will have to make a model of it to see what the exact number is)2) really, ur telling me/us this ? uh-huh, thanks . even so, at a guess you are going to need 40+ smartbombing bs to prevent cloaking just by their proximity."
"what the hell does a battleship have to do with cloaking devices?are you compeletely off your rocker or something?i think you've lost it....i suggest you take a break before you make it worse.most preys in this context are blocakde runners or cruisers or frigates...anything else is likely going to be very difficult to hide let alone escape.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"geez, i guess you still haven;t read the op.... among other things, the op proposes a counter to frag warping. frag warping involves a cloak. i used bs because of their sig radius(size), to create as many de-cloaking bubbles around the gate, aswell as the frag warping bs. if you do not know what frag warping is, i suggest you (re)read the thread."

"supported for obvious reasons.i dunno what the hell i was smoking when i came up with this god-awful name."
"i have a set of +4's and pew pew regardless. this idea is based on the belief that implants make people not want to go do other things in eve, and as far as logical fallacies go this one is pretty basic. the idea that pew pew is the end all be all of eve is wrong, as there are many things for a pilot of new eden to do in our wonderfully diverse universe, and that the only thing keeping new players from getting out there to 'play eve' as you see it is a set of implants that this hypothetical new player couldn't presumably afford for a while. if people like you, me, or anyone else want to spend their hard earned (or not so hard earned) isk on implants that'll give higher skill points, that's our right as players. if you prefer to not use them out of a fear of being podded, however, then that too is your right as a player. logically, i can only see the removal of these implants having a largely positive impact for the nullsec player base, rather than the base as a whole. as such, i cannot support this proposal, and call on non nullsec players to stand with me.and, on a side note, i can't help but notice that this first page is full of goon and test members almost exclusively... two of the biggest nullsec alliances pushing for something that'll greatly affect them, regardless of the impact (or lack thereof) everywhere else."
"this surprises you? any of the large alliances tend to steer the hand of ccp in their game design. the players that have no interest in low/null end up getting the short end of the stick, such as getting stuck with stupidly high export taxes at poco, as one example."
"they are trying to push people out of high sec and into the regions where the game is suppose to be played, i.e. low/null. the poco's were a great idea imo. but we digress..."
"no, no, a thousand times no.pay to win mechanics are not what we as a general player base want in eve, and as such this idea has been denied time and time again. i won't waste time belittling you because, regardless of your idea, the post you wrote was well done and expresses your opinion thoughtfully."
"actually, you are mistaken. lcos are the indestructable objects; lcss (large collidable structures) are the destructable ones.this is a very low priority 'issue' with very limited impact on the universe. not supported, sorry, but at the very least i like your thinking"
"supported. it is an improvement even if it is a low priority one that will likely never be addressed."
"did i get that wrong? oh well, they're listed as large collidable objects in the data dump (some are even titled lco angel bunker), but if they're lcs's instead i can roll with that.i bet you're right that this is a low priority thing. i just can't imagine it taking all that long to program. i might be underestimating the tangle of coding, but i'm guessing it is just a randomizer and a couple of tables. give it a like anyway. little thing, little time, makes the game better. it is an achievable goal, let me put it that way."
"i would really really like to see an easier way to overheat / turn off overheat for individual modules. its very hard to try to click on that little green line in the heat of battle, especially if you are managing overheat on multiple modules. most of the times i miss click and the module does not overheat or does not turn off and i end up burning it out.what i would like to see would be a much wider line on the top of the module icon, or some other easier to click hot spot and to make it red when its overheated. green when its not. it sort of makes sense.another issue is the way modules are shown as overheated or not. if the module is cycling as overheated and you click the green line to turn off overheat, there is no way to tell if your click worked or not and turned off the overheat. you wont know until the next cycle begins, which is stupid because that one cycle may burn it out. we need new indicators as follows.1. overheat off - faded green color as it it is now2. overheat on and next cycle overheat is active - solid bright stoplight red3. overheat on and next cycle overheat is deactivated (like i mentioned above) - flashing red. the soft kind of flashing, with gradual darkening and lighting. this indicates that overheat has been deactivated and the next module cycle will be normal.please please fix this!thanks!ps. no im not interested in the opinion of the \"its fine the way it just, just pay more attention and lean to be more accurate with your mouse. improvements are bad for harcore players like us\" people..."
"+1i can only agree with op, fix it ccp"

"which is precisely my point. the pieces should be set up with the board rotated 90 degrees (there is a correct and incorrect orientation for a chess board) and queens should go opposite each other, not mirrored. see this for a nice picture of what a chess board should look like."
"the prophecy is placed wrong. rule of thumb is that queen goes on color."
"lol...what a load of ****. i do suppose that something that looks as good as the carbon character engine would run and feel like crap for someone who has a ****** system."
"so what? can we expect some information as to the future of wis from ccp or do you think it's acceptable that the walk in stations stuff that ccp promised to us and have been working on for years has now just been shelved?it's blindingly obvious that a lot of people want to see more walk in stations content and the incarna crap that we have now is not what we were promised/shown. i think it's about time the csm do what they were elected and get us some solid information instead of ignoring a section of the community."
"lol"
"please give the source of the promise. they did say they were working on it and they did work on it. the fact that with current hardware its impracticle to do what they want right now does not mean they broke a promise. i don't think they are ignoring you. they did put out 2 or 3 dev blogs (1 on shaders and one on the new cqs and one on new clothes) about incarna in the last 3 months. really face it you are getting a decent amount of attention but you want more attention. you want them to return to the days when that is all they worked on. but that will kill their business. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"show me a devblog where ccp explain what happened to all the wis content (gambling, public areas drug trading) has gone and why we have been left with this incarna dress-up bullshit that nobody wanted or expected.i don't know why you guys are supporting ccp so much. they have given you nothing for years because they claimed they were working on wis and now wis has been canned! wake up, you've just been cheated out of you money. i'm a new player and there is a bunch of stuff that i would like fixing in this game but i was willing to put up with it because i expected incarna to be worth the wait... can't you see why myself and other would like to know more?"
"no-one is asking for this. no-one is asking for ccp to focus all of their attention on wis. it is a cheap trick to suggest that we are. all we want is that ccp commit to actually giving it some attention and give us some direction as to when."
"recently ccp added some new default overview settings (default pvp, default mining, etc). these are a great idea but there are two big fixes that need to happen and would take ccp 10 minutes to do.the default pvp overviewfleet members, corp members, alliance members, militia members, and blues in general should not show up on the overview. basically people you shouldn't be shooting at should not be showing up.also add a logi channel for the people who do need friendlies showing up.every other overviewthe flashy red of aggression and off yellow of negative sec status need to have a lower priority than fleet, corp, alliance, militia, good standing. i can't count the amount of times someone with a poorly set up overview has shot a friendly because they got aggression.i am sure you guys can come up with some more default overview fixes, but these are the two that really annoy me.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"not supporting.you presume that your style of pvp overivew is the same as everyone else.what about logistic pilots? what about scouts? etc...etc..etc..everyone has a different way of doing things...instead of a new set of defaults or a fix...there should bea tutorial on adjusting overivew settings as part of the npe if you will.i could be spitballing a little bit here...but everyone has there tastes for various areas of expertise and needs.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"people flying logi and people just shooting at enemies will always have a different overview anyway.just make a default logi and default everybody else in pvp overview.also when would you ever want an overview that would make friendlies flashy red every once in a while because of some aggression mechnic.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"when would anyone versed in pvp not know how to set up his overview or at least be tuaght as such?================ stop the evemail spam!"
"well following that line of reasoning, why have default overview settings at all?it's for convenience sake. it's so every fc doesn't need to worry that he'll have one dude with screwy overview settings. it's so you don't have to fiddle with your settings as much when you set up eve. it's so when you try to get people to join the game you don't need to walk them through setting up their overview to not shoot at blues every single time someone starts playing eve.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"logistics.edit: also, i find it useful to see who is on the field in a small gang engagement. not all of us are lemmings incapable of properly choosing targets on a mixed overview. i like the pvp overview the way it is."
"i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"#ERROR!"
"see my edit."
"this is where you're wrong. period. if such a game-breaking tool existed, it would quickly become a requirement to train for and use these tools to keep up with the tools that use them.this breaks wormholes. it's an incredibly bad idea that benefits the richest and largest corps and alliances only... which is pretty much going against the grain of the wormhole paradigm."
"these bombs would not be used by most corps that want to degrade their statics. in situations where the corp felt safe they would use conventional means. these bombs would cost a lot and using 5 of them a day (at 20 mil a pop) adds up to real money in a hurry. now, if your corp has the 3 billion a month to spend on these per w-space system you control, then kudos to you, but i think anyone who takes a sober look at it will see these as an unnecessary expense. if you don't believe me, run some calculations and tell me how to make it affordable.sure people will want them, and train up to use them, but unless they are in a stealth bomber, they can't. and even if they are in a stealth bomber (instead of a pvp ship), they are open to being podded. the bombs can be defeated by a single battleship with a smartbomb camping the hole. there are lots of limitations. if anything, i am starting to think that i am putting in too many concessions to try and find the middle ground."
"horse crap. if you're static is a 5 billion mass hole and you're online alone at the time the way these abombinations (c wut i did thar?) would be used to crit the static to make the hole perfectly safe for that single pilot to do whatever. it'd be worth the expense for the security to mine arkonor all day without much threat if you so chose. the rich would abuse these while the rest would still incur normal risks. they'd also become an expected expense in wormhole ops. an invading force would budget these into the assault then use them for risk free hole control of an invaded system. the whole concept of adding safety to wormholes is detrimental to the frontier lifestyle they represent in eve. too much gets broken."
"pretty much this================ stop the evemail spam!"
"so, you spend 100 million, to degrade your hole to 7% and then you mine arknor until you make 100 million to replace the 100 million you just flushed down the wormhole, then after that the rest is profit?so be it."
"you really have no concept of mining/yield/profit output of a wormhole do you?================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i get the impression he's not ready for wormholes so he's trying to nerf wormholes down to a level of safety that won't keep him awake screaming at night."
"i remember when we dragged out a ton of arknor and stuff...the problem is not getting the ore..its processing the stuff...a concept he has not experinced aparently.================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"i'm sorry that we disagree. i wish you all well."

"as long as bots can work with ocr, its just a matter of programming it to work with any visual system (pi/probing/etc)and since bots are businesses for their creators, its not hard to get good programmers for the taskso, without 100% first hand experience i can speculate (and probably be right about it) that there a lot of pi/probing botsthey could be slower than humans in those task, maybe less accurate, but the principle is simple enough to automate itread and support: don't mess with our wh's what is your stance on wh stuff?"
"yes plz, it's highly annoying."
"at last!well, at last we've gone from step one to two, but at last none of the less!edit: i've noticed that you could shave off a few pages by saying that 'mi will be the same as pi' without the need to descriptions, and in the few cases of there being changes just add those changes in. there is no need to repeat what was already said (also may want to consider such with the link and storage facility descriptions too)"
"finaly new pos system new sov system"
"my god mandownloaded, skimmed through the areas i like+ 10 internets!"
"i know.laziness set in.if there is ever a revised and reposted version of this proposal, i'll keep that in mind."
"i didn't read it because the download site looks sketchy,but if it makes pi take fewer mouse clicks to set up i'll support it.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"the idea is well thought, liked and contributed by many players in the f&i channel. i hope ccp will prove their capability of <U+FFFD>commitment to excellence<U+FFFD> through adopting wonderful ideas from player like this.to op, i will like you with all my accounts and hope for best, but seriously don't get too attached."
"every like counts. =)i have it on good authority that this document is currently being circulated amongst the powers that be.the f&i pi 2.0 topic is also a debating ground that sees new ideas pop up almost weekly.we'll have to wait and see what comes of this tho."
"agreed that if a ship is getting bonuses i should be able to shut those down by having a chance to kill the booster.this was a flawed mechanic!+1"
"actually, yes, they are.large groups rarely use t3s for boosting, as the fleet is rarely stationary. a three-link loki, legion or tengu would have a hard time surviving even with logistics (you have ****-all resists), and considering that such groups routinely use fleet warps (i.e. to land the fleet on a pos at optimal) it would be impractical to boost from off grid.you do not need to run a t3 gang link alt to be competitive, believe it or not.this isn't world of tanks. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"yeah i'd like to see gang links only work on grid. that way you could shoot them out the same way you shot out logi, rather than just have them safed up at a pos.granted this is probably an api swapping session changing nightmare, having people's stats going up and down depending on whether their squad, wing, or fleet boosters were warping on and off grid.also if you don't like the idea of a grid (being to met gamey or whatever) just say it only works within 300km.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"assuming you meant on-grid, so what? that would only affect the noobier fleets that where the fc warps everyone around with no warning .. the experienced fleets are already accustomed to bringing logis/ewar in separate from the dps/ehp boats and adding a handful of link hulls to those groups should pose no problems for them.besides, who says that there can ever only be one ship with links present and that it has to carry all of them at the expense of tank/dps/tackle/ewar/etc.? with a little dev time i am certain that multiple ships could be assigned as fleet/wing/squad booster, part of the problem is that the system is designed to have just one booster per fleet level which makes the current 1 super-link boat not only obvious but downright mandatory.guess that depends on where and how one operates. try going up against a boosted hurricane in your unboosted ditto and see how well you fare .. he'll have longer scram, higher speed, lower sig and more ehp than you can ever achieve \"alone\". but for a gank on a gate/undock or a bait/trap it does indeed make little difference.this is the main reason why the change has to be carefully implemented, especially since ccp has so far been unable to solve the shield hp issue that is caused by fleeting .. may have to change the bonus to one of recharge/resists or something to circumvent it.ideally the change would be in conjunction with an overhaul of the link ships so that the need to warp in/out constantly is limited, it should still be there but not even close to what we see with ecm birds and logistics."
"seen 0.0, been there, done that. been not impressed. sure, rocks are larger, resources are more plentiful... but is it worth all that hassle? for me, it isn't. and i'm not talking about expenses in isk only. but back to topic:using the often-cited sandbox metapher it is just a matter of what tools you have and not have. implants - regardless whether they're attribute implants, skill implants or maybe boosters (which are a sort of temporary implants, for all it's worth) are just another tool. use it or don't, it's a personal decision.taking away whatever tool there is just makes the game a bit poorer. be it modules, be it ships - even implants."
"i'd like to mention that i don't speak for my alliance! \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"\"supposed\" to? in no literature that i've seen from ccp, official or otherwise, that game play is \"supposed\" to be played in low/null."
"alright, so what attracted you to this game in the first place? the idea of running missions all day solo or all the stuff about the 600 player battles? \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"no \"end game\".every other game that i have ever played has a particular point you have to get to to \"win\", then start over. be it get to level 80, or, race to the end of the track faster than anyone else, or beat up x number of armies while collecting y number of jewels.in eve, there is no \"end game\". and there is so much to do in this game.this is the problem with a lot of people who play this game for the sake of pvp, and believe me, i'm not saying you're wrong, is that they're so narrow focused on one of the major facets of this game that there are other facets that they miss out on. true, said people may not find it attractive, they may find it boring, they may not have any interest in it. pvp is not the end all & be all of this game, and that is what fascinates me about eve."
"removing learning implants isn't going to force anyone into 0.0 or force them to change their playstyle. it will just remove the unique incentive to stay in highsec with +5's (or +4's for the poor) plugged in while not playing the game to the fullest. this is bad for the same reasons learning skills were bad, and worse because the incentive never ends unlike learning skills. of course, some of those actually doing this may feel like they're losing an advantage over people who don't"
"[sarcasm]so why not remove implants entirely then? all of them. all slots gone. totally removed from the game. no, really.. lets....[/sarcasm][seriously]when you have implants from 6-10 sitting in your head, you've got permanent bonuses that affect other aspects of the game, be it for ship bonuses, tracking bonuses, mining bonuses, whatever. some of those implants are also in the 100s of millions of isk to buy as well. they give you the the same effect as what slot 1-5 do, except they don't gear towards a permanent learning bonus, but a bonus to how you fly your ships for different situations.the only real difference between 1-5 and 6-10 is that 1-5 adds sp which extend the life of your character (excluding certain scenarios where sp can be lost), where as 6-10 grants bonuses for that moment, however, 6-10 may give you the edge you need over another player in pvp, or allows you to bring in more rocks per cycle, or whatever for \"that moment in time\". either way, the implants give an edge. the point of all the implants are to give players the choice in which edge they want. it'd be also up to the player to put in the 100 mill implant to get that extra 5% bonus for tracking speeds (i don't know if there is an implant that does that, just picking something for pvp) so it'd be their decision if they want to pay in isk for that edge.how that edge comes into play is a matter of player choice. i concede that true that you gain more sp with the implants in while offline than you do without, with no effort aside from grinding the near 600mill isk to get the set. that aspect is there. but this just means that players have the ability to get into more aspects of the game that require higher levels of skill faster with no effort. now, while sitting in +5s may be a deterrent to engage low/null, it is by no mean a game mechanic restriction. the choice is yours to put +3,4, or 5 in your head, or don't use implants at all. it also comes to mind that the same ordeal with r&d agents happen where you grind to a certain point to get research points for free. after that, the player doesn't have to do anything. but you can cash out and get an influx of isk. this also happens while the player is offline. should that be abolished as well? gain for no effort for any length of time? but, since most die hard pvp'rs don't do research i guess they'd never think of that.[/seriously]"
"i don't think you really understand anything...i mean, you're ignoring everything that has been said in this thread.everything.including the stuff that didn't make sense and was flagrantly idiotic."
"you could apply the same logic to learning skills: they too were merely a matter of choice. of course, we all know that not training them was a bad choice. bottom line is, some choices are at odds with what this game is about and they need not exist. choice is not a holy cow that shall not be slaughtered."
"the heart of this thread is risk versus deterrent versus enjoyment versus choice. each one is weighted differently for each player, and this is where everyone seems to get up in arms about. everyone should have that enjoyment scale way up high. they'd better otherwise, i really don't know why their playing. choice is also probably something that would be way up on the scale as well. risk versus deterrent will reflect the level of enjoyment and choice, simply by other players actions. right now, my corp is at war. most of us aren't war mongers, don't care to pvp (i'm one of them) but then there are a few of us who are blood thirsty, and some of us will step up to the bat and get the adrenalin rush (i'm one of them - don't care to pvp but get the rush?). i don't enjoy being in a war. i don't enjoy the thought of losing my ships at a random time because i just didn't pay attention to local once and didn't notice they came online. that turns my enjoyment level down, and the number of choices i have while in game. being in a war is a deterrent for me to play the game i want to play. that mean i should start up a thread saying war shouldn't exist for corps based in high-sec?"
"player choice is the \"holy cow\" in eve. that choice is what sets this game apart from other games. the choice to be whatever you want and do whatever you want. to train however you want and fit your ships however you want. the more you slaughter this so called \"holy cow\", the more eve becomes comparable to other mmos. now i'm not saying that other mmos are bad because they aren't eve. what i'm trying to say here is that there is a lot less player choice in other mmos compared to eve."
"its the point you make, not the toon you post with. posting with an alt doesn't give your post less credence so long as you make a good argument and stick to the topic at hand."
"wrong, forum alts are used by those who cannot stand behind their words. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"please give me some more detail as to your meaning. i don't want to make assumptions here. do you mean in an in game military aspect or in experience ?"
"none of that, really. when you're hiding behind a purpose-made npc corp forum alt (usually evident by the lack of a portrait, neutral sec status, terrible spelling+grammar, etc.) you are essentially admitting that you don't want to stand behind your posts with your main. i don't know if it's fear of retribution or the inability to back anything they say up with experience that can be shown (i.e. via killboards or reputation), but in either case, i don't really care for posters who hide behind forum alts that have been in ~hedion university~ for 4 years. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"

"so as far as i can tell the icons used to make a corp emblem or logo or whatever you call it have been around for quite some time with nothing new. we have gotten character changes, such as carbon, and wis, but not new icons to represent who we are as a group.i guess it's not terribly important, but its one of those \"thousand paper-cuts\" issues. something small that would mean a lot, to me at least, if it was updated. and, if implemented, allow older corps to redesign their logo one time to the updated icons. or, possibly make it so for a small fee (ten million isk or so) you can continually redesign your logo. kinda like companies today can change their image.just an idea..."

"things change over time.i recall hilmar some months ago saying that he wants to come back to incarna, the 'real' incarna.current incarna is a small confined single player game, which goes against everything massive and multiplayer about eve.could always give a new statement from eve developers what the future is, not that its the post 'incarna' era with crucible.wonder if crucible is a reference to the rebellion of angry players, like a 'crucible'."
"no, they had/have other stuff. it wasn't all ready to get released with incarna this summer (look at the sisi build and stuff, there are references to other places).it's probably a good bet that the winter expansion was initially intended to bring these other venues to wis -- and then the complete backlash from the community, the emergency csm summit, and other internal discussion made ccp go \"oh **** guys, we're not going to survive another expansion like this\". they came up with crucible -- fix a lot of the \"little\" things, refocus on fis, bring more ships (note, they may have been \"in the works\" anyway... and just put on a faster timetable). seriously, it's an apology expansion ... the real test of their new direction will be the summer 2012 expansion.they've pulled the majority of wis and wod and other non-dust people back to focusing on fis. wis may have a token team (like fis had for the last 2 years) so there will be little things that get done ... but they know they really have to work on the technology before they have a multi-toon environment (lest they melt people's rigs again)."

"did you even bother to read the thread?"
"follow up:1. (concerning lack of a popup): filed a petition and got a response - ccp \"can't verify\" that i did or did not get a popup so they won't act. (annoying but i won't loose any sleep over this - it just reflects badly on ccps willingness to work toward an equitable game)2. (concerning how aggression is handled in hi sec): ccp (support) says \"your disagreement with the 'one-size-fits-all punishment' is something you'll need to take to the csm or dev's as we merely explain the rules, we don't make them.\"so a final comment on the eve universe for this csm proposal:games have to be fun to be profitable - both for the devs and the players - obviously players can choose not to play and no one wants to play a dying mmpog. game choices either encourage players or discourage them - the goal (actually requirement) is that more things must encourage than discourage players to keep subscriptions rising or keep them steady and active. as an example the permanent-loss-of-ships paradigm in eve is perhaps the biggest and most controversial dev choice - quoted by many as an encouragement (it is realistic) and yet it is dramatically expensive and puts many players off. yet ship loss is a defining characteristic of eve and overall attracts a significant number of game players who dislike the shallowness of many other mmpogs.the extent of this proposal however is small in respect, thus the issue it challenges has been generally ignored. and yet, with deference to the random sociopath (sociopathic features include: grandiose sense of self, callousness, lack of empathy, \"rarely in difficulty with the law, but seek out situations where their tyrannical behavior will be tolerated, condoned, or admired\" [1]), in game \"law enforcement\" over reaction to game violations will have no encouraging effect and thus will only decrease player numbers if it has any effect at all. *** there is absolutely no rational reason to not temper concords reaction to first time offenders *** and in fact attention to details like these will only improve the encouragement players receive regardless of their level of experience.what it comes down to is what type of and how many active players do you want in the game? respect people and more will follow. no tutorial. make the game fun.this is a general attitude that should be maintained throughout the game's design, and although it was spurred by a relatively insignificant event, many other issues will fall under this proposal.[1]"
"i think the really old text that was similar to times new roman gave this game a flaming shot of class, instead of the majority of the game being minimalist blockiness (which is fine, but that flare was exotically awesome).here's what i mean. if that font got re-added as an optional font or for important things like warp announcing, i feel the game would have more \"weight\" i guess.thoughts?"

"no.two reasons why this shouldn't be implemented: 1: it would be too hard to implement, compared to how desired it is. ccp already has enough stuff to fix.2: you want to force players to join a player-corp, even if the ones they want to join don't want them, and they don't like the people in the corps that do want them."

"so i took some time yesterday to check out some of the female clothing and whatnot for my alt. i noticed the skirts that are available and purchased one. those i notice don't have any flow to them because they are tight and short. at this point i am a little curious why ccp hasn't introduced more clothing that has movement to them. scarfs for example...(god knows we don't need scarfs in the game, just an example)...would move around or bounce or sway when walking. long gowns or long sleeves on dresses perhaps. one thing i didn't take the time to check that just came to mind were the gowns the amarr wear. yes...they are gowns. get over it.ill check that out tonight i think. if the amarr gowns flow properly then there is no reason breast and fat movement isn't possible. the carbon engine is really quite impressive with all that it can do. ccp needs to show this off as much as they can. breast movement would not only do this but also add just a little more realism to the game. it is the little things that make the difference.and of course...to remind the freakout vets out there...this does not take priority over space stuff and other bug fixes."
"so you want off-grid fleet boosting to be nerfed, to the detriment of practically everything in the game (incursions, ratting, mining, defense fleets, etc.) for the marginal benefit of ~honour~ matches? \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"jumping to conclusions big time are we? you were the one who said they are not needed to be competitive, i merely tried explaining why you were wrong.is it a nerf if it brings balance to the game as a whole? consider what links are able to do .. infinitely (up max. fleet size) scalable bonuses that enhance very important characteristics. why on earth are logistics and ewar required to not only be on-grid but in range of almost everything when their individual \"contribution\" is infinitesimal by comparison? how is incursions, defence fleets et al. unduly \"nerfed\" by a change such as this? the only thing that changes as far as they are concerned is that the link ships (note: plural) will need actual pilots available as multi-boxing can be kind of iffy in combat situations.mining would be only be affected to the extent of losing the extra 15% bonus granted by the orca whereas the rorqual provides nothing additional .. where does it say that mining should be barges only with all auxiliary craft stuck in pos until needed? throw a tanked command platform into the belt, it can even help with rat clearing!!!note: personally abhor the current mining system and would prefer it be changed entirely thus making the above completely obsolete, so 'meh'.ps: keep in mind that only a few (nutters!) have asked for an on-grid change with nothing else done, best solution would be to go over the cc's, t3 subsystem and whatever else might need tweaking to facilitate the change."
"after 8 pages of posts it is blatantly clear that the only people who don't want this change are the ones that abuse this mechanic already."
"really you see people flying t3 gang link ships solo? i think it would be kind of silly to fly that without another ship that they give the bonuses to but whatever you may still see it. how does that work for them? you know if they are giving the bonuses to another ship, that is 2 ships right? to me solo means 1. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"its just a difference in the type of pvp we do and what he does. i'm not saying one is better or worse but its definitely different. for solo and small scale pvpers it makes a big difference. in fact i would almost say you practically throwing ships away if you don't have a booster alt. now with the t2 mods i'm training my alt. but the thing is eve is not going to be as fun when i am forced to do things like drag alts around with me. by forcing this down everyones throat people are more likely to get tired of eve and unsub altogether. short term gain by making people get booster alts = long term loss because eve is no longer as fun. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"whereas the only people that do want this change are likely upset that they lost their 1v1 in rancer or whatever because the other pilot was ~dishonourable~ with an off-grid t3 link ship.it has nothing to do with the other pilot simply being more competent, that's for sure! \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"no...it has to do with immunity from the risk vs reward scale that eve is supposed to have."
"overwhelm them with superior numbers, bait them next door, or deny them a fight. if you're that worried upset you can't get a killmail on some chucklefuck in a linkship (because you're not equipped to probe it down, or you don't want to bubble its pos, w/e) then i don't know what to say. \"it's easy to speak for the silent majority. they rarely object to what you put into their mouths.\" - abrazzar"
"don't say anything at all...you obviously are completely oblivious and ignorant to the entire issue."
"what are you talking about honor? there is nothing dishonorable about using t3 boosters i don't recall anyone saying there was. nice attempt at a strawman. lots of people prefer not to have to drag a neutral alt everywhere they go in order to pvp. it has to do with wanting to have fun in the game as opposed to the game being a chore. some people think eve is such \"serious business\" they don't understand that. perhaps that is why you missed a major point of this proposal. i don't know. the only thing i can say is you are deliberately skipping the reasons people actually give for wanting this proposal and creating strawmen. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"this is your serious business nulls sec mindset. \"deny them a fight\" great. you know lots of people like to pvp in this game. denying them a fight also denies you a fight. signing on with no fights is just as boring for me as it is for them. fights where you are just camping gates/setting bait and blob traps, and winning with overwhelming numbers is boring too. do you really still get any sort of thrill from that? the thing is you play the game much different than lots of other people interested in this topic. your strategy and null sec sov strategy in general often boils down to doing things that make it so the enemy no longer wants to log on anymore. the problem is those tactics often involve *you* doing things that are eyestabbingly boring as well. it<U+FFFD>s a matter of who can out-bore the other side. the side that \"wants it more\" read \"takes internet spaceships more seriously\" wins. in chess there used to be no time limits. and sometimes people would just take hours to make a move. and sometimes it took so long the other guy just couldn't stand it and left. this actually had a name. it was called <U+FFFD>out sitting<U+FFFD> your opponent. well that<U+FFFD>s the way i and allot of others see sov war in eve. how long are you going to sit camping that gate or that station? you and likely many people who play the game like you are simply out of touch with the other people who will say \"yeah this is boring/a chore i will stop playing.\" they just don<U+FFFD>t care as much as you do. if the game is boring or a chore they will do other things with their time. anyway none of this has much to do with the proposal. (other than to point out the solutions you think of, are not really going to work for people who aren<U+FFFD>t super serious about internet spaceships) if booster ships have to be on grid you can still use your strategy of outboring the other side. but on the other hand people aren't super serious internet politicians and sign in to have fun fights will get a benefit.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"anything to make mining less-bottable would be a definite improvement. if the bookmarks became an issue, add a line of code to the bm's folder interface (unseen by us) that creates a new kind of \"'roid - bm\" that de-spawns with the site.i'm *not* a coder, so have no idea if that would even be possible, but if they're going to be \"random\" spawning belts throughout a system, you would never need the same bookmark twice...random spawning belts, maybe a mining interface like pi so that you have to \"target\" the desirable portion of an asteroid to get the best ore in the 'roid - that should do a *lot* of botters in. it would also (i think) have the effect of reducing bot-mining, and make miner - mining more financially rewarding."
"personally, i like being able to log into eve, check out local, see no goons, get into a hulk and warp on an ice belt without having to probe out a site first.i think it should stay the way it is.everybody in favor of this approach could move to whs instead.make things harder for botters? in the short term, yes. then they code smarter bots who can probe and you'll be back to square one.if eve can ragequit over something as small as the nex store.. watch the rage unfold over a big change like this."
"nice concept.safeguards: systems 0.5 to 1.0 keep their belts (being charted territoriy means everybody knows where the ore is... and gankers too) sites should be small, so they wouldn't last more than three hours even to a solo hulk (so botters should bother themselves to create new bookmarks each three hours) sites should be rellocated on each shutdown and of course wouldn't ever respawn, refill nor anything that made the bookmarks usable for more than 3 hours of exploitation or 23 natural hours. additionally, would be nice to create a lowsec miner, something with a tank parallel to its cost, 3 strip miner slots w/o hulk bonus to mined amount and 1 slot for either a probe launcher or a cloaking device."
"i don't think it matters. you force ice and ore to be in sites and not belts and the bots will just start scanning. i would much rather see real belts in systems that actually span the entire system like real asteroid belts do and then add something else like sleeper rats that can kill the bots."

"1 player will not be able to build a city with many millions of people in it.. unless he has like... 10 accounts and uses each alt he has at a cost of many billions of isk to setup.these populations will start at 500 (per civilian command center) and increase with a % every day or so (this is automatic, based on the type of planet and the type of buildings/setup the player opted for), ultimately taking many months to reach the hundred thousand mark (depending on how well they can play sim city). so in that aspect, individual players will have very small networks with very small \"encampments\" as you put it, with a small amount of people on it.at the end of the day, the population on civilian networks and in larger cities will not defend themselves. that is the job of eve pilots and dust mercs. actual players will have to defend their pi and mi civilian populations against:other eve playersdust playerseconomic ruinincursions"

"not supported because it allows you to buy overall higher learning speed (or flexibility in training) with real money."
"how is that currently not the case? with more money you can buy better fittings, pay more mercs, offer head money for ganks of competitors or pay for \"protection money\" to gain easy access to farming grounds. there is no limit how much real money you can inject into the game to get isk to do so.also, with real money you can just buy an/some account(s) having some 80mil sp (each) first place. besides providing another isk sink for ccp, i do not see the problem, if the cost for another remap was made proportional to the currently applied sp - please comment on that. thus rookie mistakes could be remedied rather cheaply while wanting an extra remap at 80mil sp may cost you say 10 plex. i bet you would think twice and rather wait for the 10 days you might have possibly saved.check the moderated 10000 papercuts evelopedia page!"

"well we do have ccp focusing on flying in space rather than turning eve into a barbie dress up game, so adding ships is pretty reasonable at this point. i'd like to see the faction lineup for navies and later pirate factions fill up. we still need navy destroyers, bc's and yes, even capitals. some should be fw only while others are available at all faction appropriate lp stores. generally speaking i think the standard navy issue buffs of an extra slot or two, +50% hp and sensor strength and a little extra fitting resources would be appropriate. but some may need major changes like the navy scorpion received. one thing is for sure, the imperial navy coercer will be needing a second midslot."

"problems:eve combat comes down to either a very exhausting game of rock-paper-scissors or a competitive social networking match with little in the way of decisions that can be made during the course of combat to alter the outcome.lack of <U+FFFD>terrain<U+FFFD>i included fleet control tools, as well as ship control, in this discussion as they are imperative if line of sight mechanics are implemented in eve.system:* ships of your class can block line of sight to the target you are attacking.* they must be within the critical distance for your weapons.* the critical distance for your weapons is calculated as a percentage of your weapons base range, optimal + 1x falloff, with your skill and relevant ammunition bonuses applied.* if this requirement is met, then your weapons do not fire until there is a clear line of sight to the target.fleet formations:the ability to for formations with greater ease would be necessary if these changes were implemented. this feature would only be one of many potential changes that would target the role of fleet commander in an effort to simplify current mechanics and add new ones with the hope of diversifying and rewarding the role of the fleet commander.system:* the fleet commander should be able to form and save fleet formations utilizing a new, light, and easy user interface before forming a fleet.* during a fleet, the commander should be able to broadcast formation plans to the fleet.* these could appear as waypoints in space that fleet members have to approach.* the fleet commander should have the ability to designate a center to their formation with ease (say by indicating a fleet member as the center).* the fleet commander should have the ability to dictate the orientation of the formation around the center.* when warping the fleet, the fleet should maintain the current formation.ship piloting:this mostly applies to smaller faster vessels, but the mechanics could be added for all ships regardless of class. frigates should be able to utilize their maneuverability to take advantage of line of sight.system:1st control method:* the pilot may choose to enter this control mode.* this mode changes the function of the mouse<U+FFFD>s right key.* when the right key is depressed and held, a line will appear extending along the longitudinal axis from the bow of the pilot<U+FFFD>s vessel.* when the mouse is moved from its initial position, the line will deflect in that direction and the ship will maneuver in that direction as well.* the distance that the mouse is moved will affect how radical the turn is.* pilots should be able to modify the sensitivity of this control method in game.2nd control method:* pilots should be able to create and save maneuvers within the user interface.* these maneuvers can be used at a later date using hotkeys.* the orientation of a maneuver may be rotated along a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pilot<U+FFFD>s ship when it is performed.changes to the universe:all pos shields, asteroids, npc stations, player outposts, and other structures will block los completely for all modules except mining lasers."

"i apologize if things were unclear.assume you are flying a battleship that is currently engaged in firing upon another vessel.another battleship crosses between you and your target intersecting the line designating los to your target.if the second battleship is close enough to you, then your weapons are unable to fire until your los is clear."
"no, shift+click not working, just shift+funkcion keys."
"currently, ridding one's system of old, offline towers involves blowing them up. this isn't a challenge in k-space because: capital and supercapital firepower can readily be brought to bear on the tower, and without a reinforcement timer to delay the process, the relationship between dps and time is linear (in other words, many hands do make light work in this case). however, capital firepower and numbers are both hard to come by in wormhole space; in addition, starbases are much more frequently needed/used in w-space as stations (npc/conquerable/outpost) are not available.tower clutter is a problem in w-space as each offline tower is an entry on people's directional scanners: the more clutter on d-scan, the harder it is to see what you actually need, and simply removing towers from d-scan is not an option due to the need to keep track of towers that are online/active.i propose that one of two potential solutions be implemented as part of the next expansion: a module similar to a codebreaker or analyzer be implemented that has a chance each cycle of reverting a tower's ownership to the pilot using the module on the tower (or, alternatively, forcibly unanchoring the tower). the module would have a short range (5km maximum), so that it could not be used against an online tower. anchoring iii and hacking i would be required, roughly parallel to a data subverter except for the anchoring requirement (which could be dropped). it would be a tech i module, and have the same mineral requirements as a codebreaker i or data subverter i. starbase tower shield regenerators are shut down when the tower is taken offline by a fuel outage. this would cause the tower's shielding to slowly deplete over time while it is offline. eventually, only the armor and structure of the tower would remain to be shot through, allowing the tower to be destroyed more quickly than it would be otherwise. i don't want wormhole space to turn into a boneyard chock-full of the dead carcasses of starbases, such that you have to destroy an offline tower just to put your own starbase up whenever you colonize a system. do you?"
"on the flip side, you can build your own capital ships to defend your tower and attack other towers littering your system. in the case where a system is crowded with discarded towers and you can't erect your own, the options include attempting to make contact with the owning corporation, see if they have the time or inclination to come and take the tower down for you. perhaps they'll sell it to you, since they obviously don't want it anymore?if you are able to erect your own tower, you can easily bring capitals to clear out the towers you don't want polluting your space.the very same circumstance that encourages the proliferation of abandoned towers also mean that your tower will be relatively safe. it's not like sleepers are attacking your tower while you're logged out."
"it is not very practical t build a dred just to take down 2 offline towers. it also takes a week. it just means you have to sit there for the entire day with lazers or drones, which is annoying."
"assuming offlined towers here (stats from chruker.dk). ehp ranges calculated by hitting 100% at the weak resists, or 100% at the 50% resist. actual ehp will obviously fall somewhere in the middle. \"omni ehp\" assumes hitting the tower with 25% each em/ex/kin/therm damage, rounded up to nearest 250k.amarr -- 40m shield, 10m armour, 8m hull (50% ex, 25% kin) 58m - 98m ehp (67.25m omni ehp)caldari -- 50m shield, 4m armour, 4m hull (25% kin, 50% therm) 58m - 108m ehp (69.55m omni ehp)gallente -- 35m shield, 8m armour, 10m hull (50% kin, 25% therm) 53m - 88m ehp (61.25m omni ehp)minmatar -- 45m shield, 6m armour, 6m hull (50% em, 25% therm) 57m - 102m ehp (67.5m omni ehp)assuming we have a gang of 10 bs (and/or tier3 bc) throwing 1k dps each at a tower with 60m ehp (so, effectively hitting with 75% or more of your dps against a resist hole, and the remainder against the 25% resist).60,000,000 / 10,000 = 6,000 (seconds)6,000 / 60 = 100 (minutes)so, with 10bs ... it'll take you just under 2 hours to break a tower. unless, ofc they have 99% resists in hull whilst offline (chruker's site says 0%)."
"keep it simple. after three or so months towers \"forget\" who anchored them and can either be unanchored by the next person to come along or simply self-destruct."
"so...10bs is generally not feasible until you get to a 3mil kg or larger hole (assuming 100mil kg/bs). however, 10 tier3s is feasible, and realistic combat fits for tier3 bcs put you a bit north of 900 dps, so you're looking at 9000dps against the given 60mil ehp, puts you just shy of 2 hours/tower using only tier3s. bs obviously can achieve the higher 1000dps/ship numbers easily, so they have no problem with this (given mass limits make an all-battleship fleet feasible, which they often don't in lower class systems).also, from these numbers, you could do it in about the same length of time using 20 bombers (assuming ~500 dps/bomber, which is achievable on a hound with good skills and a max dps fit)."

"station games are rather lame and make high sec war decs a joke. war decs should be painful and hardcore like other lower security pvp. the system needs to be made high sec war decs are crippling and demanding to both the aggressor and the aggressed. both parties are automatically placed 75 km away from the station when an engagement occurs. you will have to either burn 75km to the station or burn 75km away to warp to it, assuming you are not pointed. your choice. neutral reppers will gain the same aggression as the target and will be automatically sent 75 km away from the station at the same spot of where the engagement occurs. this means that neither party can use the station as a means of cover."

"as it stands now, after sixteen missions you receive one storyline mission. that storyline mission type is random and not based on the missions that were completed to receive it. some players may be able to complete one type of missions but not another.for example, a player that runs distribution missions may not be able to run security mission. (e.g. a industrialist flying a iteron mark v trying to complete a level iv security mission)i propose that storyline missions are of the same type as the [majority of] missions completed to receive that storyline mission.examples:16 security missions = 1 security storyline mission.16 distribution missions = 1 distribution storyline mission.10 distribution missions + 6 mining missions = 1 distribution storyline mission."

"so, +1 then?"
"1) it should be the same or similar time inestment. 2) the little guy will shut down his hi-sec pos and do it all on hi-sec cities on planets. or he can keep his pos. i don't care either way. the costs of setting up indiidual networks with slots will be the same as a pos. only drawback would be that the pos uses fuel where indiidual networks dont, but the networks will cost isk to operate each month where the pos doesn't. if on the other hand, that network joins a city, it'l be ery much like a pos in terms of cost. so it'l depend on the player and what he prefers.3) pos fuel prices should remain largely as they are now, if not suffer a reduction in prices. cities will consume pos fuels, as well as make more of them ia bonuses to industrial networks spitting them out, so there should be a bit of an equilibrium thing going.4) there will be an increase in t2 production and moongoo, in the medium to long terms. so expect a decrease in prices associated with those items. this will also open up inention and moongo items to the little guy and take the monopoly away from 0.0 alliances and coalitions who hoard up all the techmoons they can find.5) more slots, no more cues for slots = more research."

"ok, some season greetings from germany. ccp what are u thinking what you doing ? eve is a good game - no discussion. but i wrote several informations to you about incarna or walking in station. what ever it will be named in the future. i know - incarna is the technology to solve your future problems. but have u realized the giant amount of coding doing a unique station environment, having the capability to get \"housed\" (like corp-offices, bars etc...) was to much, and not deeply thoughted by you.that was your fault. to declaring that incarna and for what this stands, is laying now on ice - isn't a solution.i beg to get recognized. i - and i hope other players do not want to let \"incarna\" die. we need a plan to solve this problems. we need to focus to communicate with the players. no matter if a response come from a csm-member, a gm, or from hilmar on his own - we need communication here. give us a plan - a roadmap - where we can see, how it looks like with incarna. but do not talk nothing. silence is no gold in that case.i want a open space experience - and i do not want a station environment like in star trek. this crappy station - is not bigger than the iss station. i mean - realize - like jita. there is a station, where hundreds of freighters are docked in. can u realize the dimensions of this ? the stations must be so big, that it needs hours to get from one place to the others. this is a new mmo, what you have to program. i cant understand, why are u are not realizing this big amount of coding work.if u solve this problem (thanks for your designers giving us the captain quarters) - in the future, i will kiss you - and this is the reason why i am paying for this game - every month. because i believe - you can solve this, and doing a milestone in programming a whole simulation.but anyhow. get started. tell us what happen. tell us, what you are planning, and goddamn, if you have problems to solve this in one part - try smaller steps. captain quarters was a small step. i am a coder (sorry only flash applications) i know it needs time. i do not want a solution from your side, wich is half-hearted . i want a system, an environment, wich allows to do a scalable future orientaded solution for solving the \"incarna\" problem.if you say, you have the solution, then tell us, that we have to wait, until the \"levels\" have to be designed. keep us informed.greetings"

"yeah...i can't help but agree with this. frankly the only reason i can see as to why ccp hasn't allowed it through eve gate is security and to give players a reason to log in and play once in a while. i don't think it matters either way anymore.if i want to log in and play i log in and play. if i need to change skills i log in, change skills and log out. simple as that. i spend more time on the forums at work than i do in eve at home to be honest with you. still...my biggest concern on this would be security. it would be one more door for hackers to use to obtain your account. the new api system \"should\" fix that problem...however...i would rather wait until they actually release the \"key fobs\" as extra security. perhaps even make it so you can only change your skills via the website, evemon or aura if you have the key fob for added security."
"personally, i think issuing a \"demand\" to ccp isn't the best way to go about proposing your idea.i'm not saying i'm against the proposal -- just that issuing \"demands\" will likely not get you what you want. they may have mentioned something about this in one of the more recent devblogs, as part of the \"make gate better\" push for the dust rollout."

"so go make pos fuels with your 20 separate industrial networks only. nobody is going to stop you or change the way you do it, make it more difficult or more time consuming. unless some bigger alliance doesn't care for you doing this in their backyard out in 0.0.enjoy clearing them one at a time for the rest of days as well.i'd rather do them all et mass by combining everything into 1 - 6 cities. but that's just lazy old me."

(at least if they have any intention of staying for a fight instead of warping off as soon as an enemy comes)i think that will be the inevitable result once people figure out the fits. if i am right then this made the diversity of ships in minor plexes much much worse. regardless of this issue though. what about the op proposal? is hide and seek plexing still a problem? wouldn't we get more fights if the players knew where the plexes are being taken?make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"well, i don't want to have a big sign saying we're plexing in akidagi right now!!!! i want them to take a look at the occupancy map and see that there's a big ass blob over the system and say to themselves 'self, i think there's bad guys plexing in akidagi. i think i should scout it/take a fleet in and see what we can do.'it's still pretty easy. heck, if the caldari want good fights, then they should just come and plex over near nenna. open plexes, sit in plexes. cap plexes. soon enough it'll get noticed by us and we'l come a fightin'! a few of us have been known to come into a plex with even numbers. or down 1. we just want fights, same as them."
"well if you are openly attacking their military complexes, isn't it odd that they are *not* notified of this?its actually pretty easy to plex without pvp. ank proved this. she capped over a hundred plexes in less than a week and never did *any* pvp. i agree for the most part both sides want gfs. the problem is finding them. when i plex i would say there is less than a 5% chance a war target will enter the plex i entered. i don't think that is really that great for pvp. in fact i think that sucks. giving the militia a notification would solve this. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"i guess where you go from our disagreements is what kind of notification system do you want? something in militia chat? something in your notifications (that i largely ignore because of pvp notification lag)? i'm guessing what you want is something that's non-intrusive that gives an up to the..... 10-15 minute update of current systems being plexed?i also wonder if all of this is a moot point because of the last csm and the fact that they discussed fw during it."
"it may be moot. but anyway what i was thinking is a seperate channel that would only give notifications of complexes that have been entered. no players would be able to type in the intel channel. otherwise it would look just like any other channel. it would just generate messages like \"cearain merlin entered minor auga\" the timestamp could be enabled so you would know when i entered. actually there would be one chat channel for the gallente caldari front and a different one for the minmatar amarr front. i would have access to both but i would probably only look at the for the front i am currently fighting at.the intel would be immediated that way a pilot nearby would have enough time to jump there and possibly save the plex. it would take balancing but the idea would be to keep the fighting fast paced and dynamic. the militias would have to assign different pilots to several different sections of the front. so if the minmatar saw the message \"cearain merlin entered minor auga\" someone might report in their intel channel that they are going in that minor with a destroyer. if 5 people from the minmatar said they were going in with destroyers someone might reassign some of them to another system that would need defending instead of doing overkill in that one. that way they would be using all their pilots as effectively as possible.if one side had larger numbers then the other side may have to abandon certain areas but they could still regroup and try to be competitve in others. that is the goal i would be going for. there would need to be allot of tweaking, but this proposal would be the first step. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"learning implants reward good players. people in this thread complain about learning implants because they got podded and are mad about it.my opinion? deal with it.gif"

"just bumping this idea because i believe it would satisfy both sides of this debate."
"we're all very sorry that your too scared to leave highsec but that is not a reason to eliminate a part of the game. your lack of courage is not our problem. this is probably the worst argument to support this proposal that i have seen posted here."
"the underlying problem with implants in this game is pod killing/saving mechanics are stupid. in empire killing/saving a pod is a matter of how good your internet connection is. in null sec/wh its just a matter of whether there is a bubble or not. in either case there is no real game play or skill involved in saving/killing a pod. yet allot hangs in the balance! this proposal has some merit because it makes it so there can't be as much hanging in the balance of this terrible mechanic.a better solution would be for ccp to make pod killing/saving mechanics better.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"recently a new player i was teaching to play the game fell victim to the margin trading scam. this has somewhat dampened his enthusiasm for the game and as he was trading to save up for plex, even if he does want to keep playing he might not be able to. now i realise this is not considered an exploit by ccp who seem happy to see off potential customers in this fashion, so there is nothing to be done through petitions. i thought however that it might be entertaining to approach the problem in-character within the eve world.the eve market has a broker trading system, administered by the secure commerce commission. this is to ensure fair trading and i always recommend new players to exclusively use the market for trading because of this.given the nature of this particular scam, i feel that the scc is at fault for any losses incurred. specifically under false advertising statutes. the scc, on behalf of a capsuleer, is offering to pay x isk, for x units of some commodity/item. the scc in these cases never has any intention of buying these items at this price. they have access to the capsuleer's wallet and can check any time whether the player can afford the items. capsuleers are told to use common sense to avoid this type of scam, but calling an intimate knowledge of the high level trade skill mechanics 'common sense' for a new player is a stretch. in addition the same argument could be used to say that the scc could be using their common sense. they actually have access not only to the persons current wallet amount, but also their history of prior activity and it should be a simple matter for them to use their common sense in rejecting this kind of false buy order. i have been playing the game for years and never used margin trading, so i didn't know about the mechanic myself, or i could have warned my students.i wanted to post a message to the scc to invite them to out of court negotiations pending my lawsuit, but i can find no way of contacting them. i thought perhaps as a constituent the csm might be able to offer representation or at least put me in contact with the scc. i think it would be unwise of the scc to ignore this as a ruling in my favour could open the floodgates to thousands of similar lawsuits and cost the organisation trillions. the point of broker trading is that the broker guarantees the transaction, we pay significant costs for this service, and on previous occasions where i have made mistakes in terms of typing in too many or too few zeros, or similar issues, the scc has always been happy enough to take my money, even on occasions where i have immediately rectified the situation. in cases like this where the scc made the mistake of offering to buy a commodity they never intended to pay for, they should take the hit themselves, and sort it out with the offending trader any way they can. trust is crucial to the scc's operations and this is a major breach."

"removing local chat and (afk) cloaking - two subjects that have been done to death. let's waste some time discussing a combined solution that ccp will never implement!a) enforce constellational chat as local is now. all players online in a constellation show inside this channel, but there is no indication of which system they are in. players also show in local as they do now, with one exception...b) any player with an active cloaking device is removed from local. they cannot be seen there, and in turn cannot see anyone else there themselves.should the player be decloaked they return to the local channel as normal.c) introduce at least one method for identifying or forcibly decloaking any cloaked ships. i'm keeping this intentionally vague as it will be a key balance issue, but possible methods include: re-purpose supercarrier ecm burst into anti-cloak pulse. add a similar module for other ships - such as the rorqual - to encourage it to be on-grid during mining ops. starbase modules that can be manually controlled to emit an anti-cloak pulse within a given range (could require sov upgrade to use). new scan probes that will confirm the existence of a cloaked ship within a relatively small area, without giving away the exact location. the idea behind all this is that it's still entirely possible to rack up the sneaky kills with clever use of your cloaking device, but a savvy player will still have various options to use before making themself vulnerable. some of the suggestions at the end are deliberately intended to play on the risk/reward aspect of eve - such as putting out capital ships to reduce the risk to smaller ones, while still facing risk themselves."

"t3's are currently the closest thing to a subcapital pwnmobile. they excel in many areas and have too few weaknesses to stay true to eve's rock, paper, scissors concept. and although with their modularity they are supposed to be jacks of all trades and thus master of none, they overshadow various (specialized) t2 ship classes.what i propose to fix this is not a dramatic nerf, but a mild adjustment which is far from killing the usefulness of the ship class.- reduce the number of rig slots to 2. in keeping with the t1/t2 tradition it should even be only 1, but lets leave it at 2 for now. dropping a rig slot has basically two effects: one is losing a bit of flexibility, of which the t3's still have plenty through the subsystems, the second is reducing a bit of whichever characteristic people were maxing before: buffer, cap, dps, etc.- reduce the bonus to effectiveness of gang links of the warfare processor subsystem from 5% to 3%, to bring it in line with fleet command ships. a maxed and mindlinked t3 can give some pretty insane bonuses, more so than field cs, which are supposed to be top dog here.- increase subsystem skill rank from 1 to 2 at least. even considering the possibility of skill loss upon death, the training time for such a powerful ship class is a joke. i'm not a fan of the skill loss mechanic, but if it is to be kept, i'm in favor if increasing the risk inherent in flying t3's.i'd like to include other things like a maybe a 10% reduction of ehp across the board, but unlike ccp i'm in favor smaller tweaks at a time. one would have to see how these changes play out in the wild. there's probably other small tweaks that could be included in this list now, please comment.i'm aware this proposal is controversial because obviously no one wants their shiny toys nerfed. but let's do it for balance. i am also aware that some t3's are under-performing, especially the legion. although this is a nerf proposal to the ship class, i am not opposed to giving some love to specific t3 ships or aspects."
"except for their boosting abilities, tech 3's are (more or less) fine with the exception of the tengu."
"i'm not sure how the legion can be classed as \"under performing\" unless you compare it to the tengu.the tengu is overpowered. want proof? simply head out to any mission hub. where are the cnrs, golems, machariels, paladins? it feels like half of the populace are flying tengus these days. i say feels like because i'm making the claim without sitting down and performing a survey.the nerf the tengu needs is not hp or rig slots, it's simply a nerf to the combined bonuses of extra kinetic damage, extra rate of fire, and extra range: no other missile boat in the game gets all three bonuses together. a tengu pilot should have choices to make: perhaps the fifth offensive subsystem can be a long range/damage bonus subsystem, while the current one gets diminished to the rate of fire/kin damage bonuses.as for warfare link processors: the contest between command ships and strategic cruisers could easily be evened out if fleet boosting had to be done on-grid. no need to nerf the 5% t3 bonus, since you won't be able to fit more than two warfare links if you want to have any kind of tank. more warfare links means more command processors and more cpu mods, which means fewer mid or low slots for tank.all this is only my opinion of course, but i actively abuse a 6-link off-grid booster tengu while flying a hml mission tengu. i would fly a cnr if the tengu wasn't just so damned good."
"i feel the same. the tengu is displacing many of the dedicated mission ships.i am not opposed to this tengu nerf.that is another proposal i already supported.people work around that limitation by using the fleet hierarchy and more than one t3. and i definitely think the actual t3 bonus amount needs a nerf, not to mention a lot of people question the whole concept of a single/few ships giving 250 ships bonuses...well thank you for still agreeing it needs a nerf"
"who gives a **** about \"pve balance\"? that's like saying that cruise missiles are overpowered because cnrs are the most common faction bs in mission hubs. that's not a comment on how balanced the ships are, it's a comment on how bad eve's pve is.trying to balance ships around the brain-dead npcs we have instead of trying to balance the npcs against the way ships actually work in pvp is the fundamental error here."

"a major gripe among those who live in 0.0 is the sov system, how it is bad x, y, and z. while i do not have any ideas for a complete overhaul, and i am aware of the wariness expressed by csm members about wading into this morass, i have an idea i wish others to see and criticize.the source of greatest frustration to myself and others i know is the reinforcement timer mechanics. it is my desire to remove either the attacker or the defender from deciding the length of a timer; rather, the limited randomization of such a timer seems to me a fine solution to the issue of cross-timezone sov warfare.what does this mean? the basic premise of the reinforcement of a structure is fantastic. the allowance for a day or so to organize the defense of a structure is critical to game mechanics. what is not critical, in my opinion, is the determination of when exactly the structure will exit reinforcement; indeed, i believe this component to stifle pvp in 0.0. the \"limited randomization\" should be something like this: putting in x amount of strontium clathrates into a tower/structure allows for a reinforcement timer to activate of at least, for example, 36 hrs, with a random component of +- 12 hours. the implementation of such a system would allow for a corporation/alliance from 1 timezone to assail a corporation/alliance from a different tz. the variability should allow for timers to occur in a more interesting manner to the attacker, and hopefully would make for more large-scale fights.in my opinion giving the defender the dictation of the time of the fight (assuming minimal brain function and 1 person online with access to the pos) makes for boring wars. while there are methods to get around this, such as kiting a tower once below 50% health, or attacking during the holidays when players have more flexibility in their playstyles, i feel that a less demanding solution is this small randomization. defenders can be still reasonably certain that they will have a defensive timer in a workable timezone for themselves; if the first timer is miserable, they still have 2 more tries. and if that fails, they still have many more systems to go, and can go on the offensive themselves. under my model, if a faction reinforced 10 structures, they could be reasonably certain that at least 1 would exit reinforcement in their preferred timezone, and there would be several others that would be in timezones that are in timezones both sides could fight over.tl;dr limited randomization of reinforcement timers would make the game more fun and would make cross-tz sov warfare less painful for the attacker. i am growing weary of staying up to 2 am, or waking up at 4 am, to participate in a fleet fight. randomization would allow pilots a chance at a fleet fight, instead of none without taking extreme measures such as altering one's sleep schedule. i think all of 0.0 would appreciate this change."
"there is no up or down in space. but a galaxy can have an up and down side. maybe some guys and girls just decided that one way was up. and subsequently all stations were built around the idea that one side was up and the other was down. the ships that were built followed this concept and even adapted to levelling to this imaginary planar. a sense of up and down makes things feel a little bit more natural for humanoids."

"while you're right that there are ways around this problem, i agree with the op that it's counter-intuitive that a stopped ship realigns instead of simply stopping."
"i believe the costs to war dec is really cheap, i propose that there should be a bidding war between the aggressor and the victim in determining war dec costs.this will allow industrial corps to easily fend of lone corps since they will most likely have more money. here's how it will work:war deccing corps will start off with 2 million with 2 million increments in bidding.war deccing alliances will start off with 50 million with 50 million increments.each bid will prolong the auction until 24 hours pass after the last bid. this will also serve as an isk sink to help balance the isk faucets within the game."
"heh."
"something like this would be a nice addition when wardecs are reworked, but adding it to the current system won't do that much good. your idea needs more work regardless. how do you ensure one participant can't delay the war indefinitely by waiting to the last minute to outbid the other? the 24h extension after each bid is simply too long. it would be better to have a set duration for the auction with small extensions after each bid, if there was less then the extension time left on the timer. basily a wardec contract auction. after a winner is determined hostilities start after a 24hours or you get a decshield against the aggressor for a set period of time.the bigger issue is what happens when a side wins the auction? currently you can easily shed a wardec or just leave the corp and the deccer can use alt corps to force reauctions and transfer to one when it wins an auction, so the system in many cases doesn't really offer satisfaction to the winner of the auction, because of the various loopholes in the current mechanic. i think an auction system would still be an improvement, but the wardec system needs a complete overhaul not just little tweaks."
"your sheer ignorance of the situation is staggering.you assume industrialist corporations have more isk than the attacker.if you think that...you have a lot to learn...more so than you realize.and that is just one of many problems in your proposal.making them more expensive is a good thing....but its a temporary fix at best...but not based on your very very poor assumption.================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"no, because this would significantly add to the time to start up a war and allow the targeted corp/alliance more time to move assets, drop in and out of corps, and generally engage in behavior that used to be considered exploits. also, any restrictions placed on at-war corps would have to be extended to this time frame as well. this would just make wardecs even worse.edit: also, there's the obvious problem of what happens when i wardec you, you buy your way out of it, and then i wardec you again. all it would take is for a number of people to make their own corps, wardec yours one at a time until you run out of isk with which to defend yourself. then they all join whichever corp won the bidding war and you're right back where you started, only you're out quite a lot of isk."

"*support*this has for my admittedly short playing career been something that has annoyed me greatly. i don't know if its only the ship animation that returns to the plane and the server keeps a vector in the right direction. regardless of whether this change would be functional or purely cosmetic, it needs to happen. my one suggestion is that they either put this as one of those check off option boxes in the menu or they add a command to 'level to orbital plane' because i can see the usefulness of having the common reference point for certain applications."
"i was doing some gallente missions the other day, and generally the serps like to sensor damp you. this is annoying, but i decided i would counter their damps by tweaking my fit to add a sensor booster when i do their missions. as i was doing this, i wanted to monitor the amount of damping they were doing to me in real time. so i turn on my \"fitting screen\" and pushed it all the way to the left so i could see my effective targeting range change as i came under various levels of sensor damps.at that point it occurred to me, that the little window on the far right of your fitting screen, that shows you your ehp, would make a perfect stats screen if only you could cut off the rest of it. it would be awesome to have during pvp.i would like to see a button on the fitting window to \"minimize\" it, or hide the ship fitting part and just show your ehp, defense, offense, and targeting statistics. then you could move it around as an fully docking information window that you could choose to use during combat to monitor the status of your ship during.this would take a minimal of coding resources. and i think this would fit in the direction that the eve ui seems to be going. ie more compact information being offered in an easy to read format. the better information is presented, the better everyone flies and the more fun to be had for all.its a simple proposal, but requires little effort, and has the potential to enhance combat. any thoughts on this?"
"forum ate my proposal twice; good thing i copied it the second time.forum ate my proposal..to reiterate:i was reading the hybrid rebalance notes and comments in the information portal earlier, and thought of this as an additional solution for galente/hybrid balancing that doesn't affect other factions or indirectly create exploitable bonuses on gallente ships.the idea is just a basic modification which would be applied to all gallente ships to one degree or another, and assist them in fitting armor tanks, while maintaining the role/usage amongst the different factions. worst case scenario wih rebalancing is that all ships of a similar role/classification become indistinguishable from each other in all but outward appearance. this avoids that, and helps to actually increase the individuality of the various factions ships in all classes and roles.essentially, the idea is to reduce the incurred velocity and agility penalties applied by fitting armor tanks to gallente ships by a percentage reduction of effective mass addition, based on the typical role/usage each ship. rail platforms and ships dedicated to long range electronic warfare or drones for example, would see less benefit, than those dedicated to blasters, tackling, or the like.example would be a ~20% reduction in effective mass addition for velocity, and ~15% reduction in effective mass addition for agilty resulting from the fitting of armored plates on a brutix for a buffer tank. alternatively, it could be a flat reduction of ~20% to effective mass with regards to the penalties applied to both, to keep things simple and minimize claculations.it's not that the ship ways any less; it's just that the ship is less affected by it's weight.zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub"
"1.0"
"i fully support this idea, especially the automated npc-fleets moving your stuff from the planets."
"that's way more than knowing where the fighting is occurring. i would almost keep the intel open ended and let the militia coordinate on their own.like if a militia had a channel specifically for plexing. i think ccp is trying to stay away from npcs as much as possible and get that kinda stuff into the hands of the players. i don't think there's ever been someone's job to just check all contested systems and see if there's someone currently plexing there. if there was to be an npc plex reporting channel, then i'd also have less intel in that it. maybe just letting you have a real time list of what's contested or...... where there's plexes that are currently being run with updates around 10-15 minutes. from an rp standpoint, you could say that the intel/comm routers in low sec are old and in disrepair so that they don't give exact intel. i'm still not sure if i would want npc updates though. maybe if fw gets some sort of sov system where we can install upgraded comm relays, then sure. otherwise, i dunno."
"i'm still against any form of automated system that gives automatic intel with no work. updating the map would be a good way to go about this, perhaps have the systems that are contested blink or change color if they had a plex taken within the last hour. but beyond that, everything should be in the hands of the players."
"if you don't want to lose you +5 set in pvp, don't pvp in them. ccp gave you the option to have more than one clone so you can have more than one set of implants, or none at all. once again, this is something introduced by an old player, for the 'benefit' of new players. i call shenanigans. eve is a game of choices and consequences, if you click the \"use jump clone\" button you better mean it, because you are told in advance that there is a 24hr timer on using it again. if this means that you happen to be in your +5 clone when delve gets attacked by whoever the f--k is out there now, and you don't want to risk losing your training clone, then tough ****, go tomorrow. i have had a +5 set since i could afford them and that has never stopped me from roaming with my friends whenever i damn well please, and i live primarily in wh systems. i'm smart about it, and stay in a group. i do everything i can to make sure i come out of the fight pod intact. but if i lose it? oh well, time to start saving again. if new players can't afford uber implants, then the game mechanics must be working because uber implants are designed to be expensive. new players, unless they sell plex, won't have that kind of isk for a while. in my opinion uber implants are intended to be a reward for the older players who have stuck it out and have earned some accelerated training times or better ship stats.if i missed the point of the thread, please let me know so i can amend my post, it's 3am and i'm very tired."
"i would also like to point out that your training time as a new player is much different than when your an older player. as a new player, you primary train skills that are between the 1x to 5x training times. older players are in a far different situation. we have to train skills in the 8x to 14x range. newer players don't need the +5 learning implants as much as older players do. if they have to train in +3 implants for a while, it really isn't a big deal. they don't have to sit through 52 day skills when they want something to level 5. i can understand helping out the new players a bit. though in truth, i don't believe eliminating implants is going to help them. yes, they'll train faster but i doubt there will be any more motivation to pvp because of it. what i have really noticed in this game, is that in most cases, the ones who want to pvp, do. the ones who don't, won't. no amount of elimination toward those expenses, short of making pvp risk free, will persuade them otherwise. and that, is something we cannot do."
"you got it backwards. new players need the faster training time because they can't do anything well. veterans on the other hand are in no rush - they can already fly a ship for every occasion and then some and have what they need to secure an income."
"the average train time on a new players skill is like a day. you wanna give them natural +5's to drop it by an hour or so per skill? not worth it. the way its set up works fine, you learn the game as you train and by the time you can fly the bigger and better ships you are more skilled w/ skill points and your personal ability to fly. throw a noob into a 60 mil s/p toon just means he's going to be losing tech 3's instead of frigates."

"tell me about it. i'm stuck behind a desk doing my job with little to no time to get invovled in gradiose epic battles but i've watched...studdied...yearned....wantted...maybe \"lusted\" for such things but alas must pay bills and care for my lovely wife.but the point remains...i have enough comon sense to not make such assumptions without people giving me a great deal of insight into large scale battles. it's never as it seems and you end up fighting a number of problems...mass numbers..traffic...compliexty...a fc that expects you to pay attention.and now your going to complicate this with the crap concerning of los.oh don't get me wrong...i get it..i think its great in reallity...but in eve?your asking for pandoras box.snow balls chance in hell.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"i would request that you provide specific, detailed arguments against the proposal at hand. what you have done is attack me. who i am is irrelevant. the weakness of argument lies with you not i.i shall attempt to distill your argument for you. it seems to revolve around server load and/or player response time under lag conditions. i would agree that these are potential killers of the idea if it were to be determined that they were severe enough. i do not believe that you, or i, have the technical expertise to make that call however, and i would leave this determination up to ccp developers. this mechanic might help with the server lag problem, assuming that the check itself does not negate the gains, by creating a scaling logistical cost to your fleet as it increases with size. as a fleet increases with size, the formation required to ensure that all fleet members have an unobstructed los to their targets would increase in volume and complexity. a slightly smaller fleet might be more desirable.the ability to warp and maintain formation would make remaining in formation much less stress inducing, but you would still have to travel to the way points for the initial formation. i have even toyed with the idea of allowing the fc to automatically warp the fleet into a new formation with the added mechanic that if the intervening distance was not long enough members of the fleet would not arrive in formation. they would have to travel the remaining distance to their broadcast way points on their own resulting in a potential loss of dps."
"it also would distract people from their blobs to actually have to keep track of line of sight and positioning in microcosm and most people who are out to massacre other people are mostly looking for minimal risk and effort despite all the complaints about how boring blob combat can be.agreed. good idea in theory but perhaps not in practice."
"that isn't really relevant. the problem is that the computer doesn't magically see the loss just because it has the location info. currently the server propably only needs to know is the locked target is in range+can your shot reach that target+do you hit it. all other info is pretty static, so it doesn't need to be recalculated constantly. with los you need to calculate the flight path of every shot and compare it against all other objects in range to see if any of them cross that line. you've turned it from \"check against the selected target when the gun is activated\" to \"calculate line of fire and compare it against all other objects in range when the gun is activated\". it's a totally different scale of calculations compared to what we have now. in a fleet fight it's not going to be just 1000 extra checks it's going to be thousands of checks per ship or gun, if they are ungrouped. los only works in games where the number of players are low. it's the reason large scale combat, in the scale that eve currently offers it, is impossible in all multiplayer games that have los.it's also a can of worms because of the aggression rules. depending on the exact choice it's either a huge cause of accidental concordokkens or free ganking and can offer the possiblity to use neutrals to block ship guns, if the guns will simply refuse to fire. it raises problems with missiles too. are you going to have the server calculate free flight paths for every missile or stop them from launching just because the direct line of fire is blocked at the time of the launch? missiles are also entities, so are you going to be checking the los against them too?point being it's going to make current scale fleet fights totally impossible and cause several issues with the mechanics no matter how it's implemented. maybe it could work if it only calculated huge structures or asteroids instead of ships, but los calculations on the scale you imagine would ruin the current game and the benefits just aren't worth it imo."
"if anybody actually reads the op's post and takes into consideration all that is proposed (and if they have a brain) they would realize that it would actually work and probably quite well at that. what he is proposing is a mechanic that would not only bring in more of a tactical feel to the game but utterly change the way pvp is played today. formations would allow fleet commanders to adjust the fleet accordingly to allow the maximum number of ships to be able to hit targets without getting in the way of each other. as the opposing fc's counter adjust their formation to protect one ship or fire on another the other fc would have to do the same. it would also start making people think about where they are going and where they are right then and there. do i keep moving forward to get a better angle on that ship or do i move in to protect my buddy who is about to die?this would also likely break up the blob mechanic of current fleets as nobody would want to be in large fleets with a less likely chance of being able to hit anything. they might break up into smaller multiple fleets part of the same operation. flanking would then have a purpose for example. sniper fleets might become useful again..."

"again....never said that it wouldn't be utterly fun or hillarious.its irrational in the current system and how eve online functions in the context of very (not large or itty bitty) large scale fleet fights.the whole reason behind time dialation is the primary reason for this being horrible...the server cannnot handle it.its slowing down time in-game to catch up to the clients requesting copious update requests.if the op had bothered to read the freaking dev'blogs you might actually learn something.los is great in a funny friendly fire scenario,...but this is not reallity...this is not terran field space...its space.and there's a-lot of it.================ stop the evemail<U+FFFD>spam!"
"\"currently the server propably only needs to know is the locked target is in range+can your shot reach that target+do you hit it.\" you do not really know though, and neither do i. a line between you and your target already exists. you can see it by turning on your tactical overview. i do not know if my experience represents the norm, but i have experienced no noticeable lag when toggling the tactical overview on. either this line is already present and not shown, or it takes a miniscule amount of power to generate.i imagined a single line extending from the center mass of your ship. this sacrificed the realism of having individual los for every gun, but i did it for the server blades. the poor, poor server blades that might implode under the stress. missiles would also sacrifice realism for function. missile ships would use the same mechanic for calculating los as turret ships. i toyed with the idea of allowing missiles the ability to travel around large static objects like pos's, but the amount of math required for this would seem to be substantial. i also feared making cruise missile ravens op. so in short there would be a single line from your ship to your target.\"it's also a can of worms because of the aggression rules.\" this is the only serious problem that i have seen so far in this thread, and it is very serious. i apologize. i am used to fighting in low sec, wormhole space, and null sec. i have not fired a shot in anger in a while due to being disappointed in eve, and i am pretty sure it has been over 3 years since i have fired a shot in anger in high sec. in short neutral shielding of targets in high sec warfare is a killer. you probably should have listed that first. i am going to have to ruminate on that one for a bit. i cannot see a way to negate the problem at this moment.thank you destination skillqueue for your additions to the discussion. i shall try and find a way around the high sec/concord problem and post it soon."
"for a purpose of server \"knowing\" whether you can shoot or not - no, this line does not exist now. and to \"know\" it server must cope with the dreadful \"n square\" problem. you do not need to know all the math and coding to understand that, it is very simple logic actually. it is amazing how many people still can't understand it though.the line you are talking about is drawn by your client and evaluated by your brain. the server does not possess their computing power and needs to rely only on his own, for the sake of security.the only thing we don't know without knowledge of all eve innards is how much it will add to the existing calculations. will they increase tenfold, or by a mere 10% because server already does so many things. but \" n square \" inevitably will be there.<<insert some waste of screen space here>>"
"i have been following several of the threads regarding complaints about fuel blocks and a thought comes to mind.... since one of the main issues with them is they removed people's flexibility in fuel requirements (and forced everyone to pay for a null sec use case and created a new artificial demand for null sec fuel that research poses never needed before.), why not diversify the types of fuel blocks one can produce. i could easily see something like:(1) high energy fuel blocks - full cpu/pg(2) high cpu fuel blocks - high cpu, low pg (for research poses)(3) minimal fuel blocks - low cpu, low pg (for temp/staging poses)this would reintroduce some of the flexibility of 'match the fuel usage to the use case' while still allowing the simplification fuel blocks give.it would also make the dependency on oz dependent on what kind of activity you are doing, rather then the 'one size fits all, this is how null sec people use poses so of course it should require lots of stuff produced there' model that we have right now."
"so your going to complicate a fuel system that was simplified to something more complciated that it was before.don't get me wrong...motivation is valid..i get the purpose...but this isn't gonna work.might want to go back to the drawing board...don't know of any suggestions off hand...i like the simplicity of new fuel blocks.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"you err significantly when you call full cpu/pg a 0.0 use case. pretty much every tower outside hisec is going to be maxing pg due to the need to fit defenses, while many of these towers use significant cpu (moon mining, refining, assembly, labs) even without considering ewar batteries, such as in the case of a wh dickstar tower, which is going to fill its cpu and pg to the brim even more so than most nullsec ones will.also, i do not see the utility of a minimal fuel block over a full-spec one for a staging tower, or even a throwaway one, as leaving a tower defenseless for anything longer than a span of days invites an attack, especially in k-space as there are bored supercap/dread pilots to contend with."
"i agree it is not quite as simple as 'one block for everything', i think it is less complex then.. what was it.. 7 different commodities each of which need to be dolled out manually at each tower in the right ratios. this setup would at least keep the complexity to the manufacturing end."
"good point. i admit i am not a nullbear so it was a case i was only really aware of from reading the other threads and how it seemed to be the one that experienced a decrease in costs.in this case i was thinking of very short term towers. i occasionally put up small towers with just a maintenance array and corporate hanger. they were pretty cheap to run and could be used to interface with a freighter after a single op."
"that particular point was one i didn't touch due to the fact that pos's in nullsec and highsec are worlds apart.you have conord protection....we don't.heavy pg/heavy cpu is a balancing act.your fuel changes could cause major problems....but it's not something i'm an expert in.the frequent issue with most proposals is people don't forget to weigh in all walks of eve life...tunnel vision is a bit of a draw back.null sec life is very hectic and rampant at times....1 fuel block for all things of 1 racial pos type is a quick and dirty solution...even if inelegant...the only people who are losing out are those who don't employ maxium consumption of the pos resources. it was a sticking point...but one that can be overlooked by propper management.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"this is kinda my point. now there is a one-size solution, but it is optimized for null sec. what i propose is adding in a number of type of fuel blocks so that people in different situations can use a different block. this proposal would still include the current block type but add in two additional types, so trying to get away from the current tunnel vision."
"i wouldn't agree its tunnel vision. making changes generally means somebody benefits and somebody suffers. no matter what the change this is the case. a good change is when the benefits out way the suffering. look on the brightside, your now getting free pg/cpu so you may as well use it to make your pos look more... busy. might be helpful in the case of a possible war dec."
"would be easier to simply have one fuel block for cpu, and another for pg. have them consumed at a rate matching the percentage used. call the cpu fuel \"coolant\" to make it fit the situation better: you fuel your reactor more to drive a higher pg, and your computers run hotter with increased cpu demand.or just leave it as is."
"that makes sense....good luck convincing ccp however.================ stop the evemail spam!"
"or, you could slap up some extra labs/assembly arrays and rent the space out!the moral of the story is: tower fuel efficiency is dead, so make the maximum use of your towers now!"

"this.takes 1 dev 1 day to implement."
"so much +1three months is a pretty reasonable time-frame. this would also prevent people 'reserving' moons in highsec with offline towers."
"three months is a horribly short time. if you want towers to become 'abandoned' i'd suggest a reasonable timeframe would be 12 months, to allow for people who are sent by work to places where they can't access the internet at all, or at best have expensive bandwidth which can't be spent on games.three months is the kind of time that runs past when you let the tower go idle \"for a few days\" while you head off exploring null sec pvp, traipse around low sec getting absorbed into exploration, or decide to help a friend out with some faction standings.building dreadnoughts and carriers in w-space is par for the course: if you don't do it, some pvp corp will set up their own tower as a safe base of operations from which they can stage their attacks on your corp members and towers. if you can't bring superior firepower to their live, online tower, you will end up losing your own tower."
"i once anchored small towers on all the moons in a wh system to deny another corp the ability to establish a foothold.i think everything is working just fine. on the other hand, you sound kinda lazy."
"i'll counter that as long as it's a one-system affair, it doesn't matter if it's a single corp or alliance running things -- since you can just launch the ships for the other guys to hop in (still, a pos fix would be nice ccp). if you're going through one or more systems, things get interesting (read:annoying).yeah, definitely went with \"gank >>>>>>>> tank\" on the talos fit. mostly, because we're talking about an offline tower in w-space, so you're gonna be right up against it, and don't have to deal with range so much; and it's a \"fair\" bet that the owners don't have anyone able to do anything about it. i'm also assuming that if you had ~10 of those fits, you'd have a guardian or two as well, maybe a falcon to increase the \"gtfo\" ability. now, if we're talking about removing an online tower, then we've got to switch to rails/artillery/beams, so we'll lose dps there... and then there's the need to fit a semblance of a tank.yeah, i understand that shipbuilding requires a lot of pos resources (and here i thought null was a ***** for that ). again, my suggestions are built off the idea that the op has settled in a system (so, i suppose it has a static), so blowing through the mass limits one time (to get the ships, or a secondary tower for construction, etc) shouldn't really be an issue -- and if you're going to settle, you might as well get a cap or two in there (there has been more than one w-space system we've passed by because \"oh, found a carrier/dread on d-scan\"). obviously, if we're talking about an un-settled system that you're trying to siege, then you really have to weigh the pros/cons and come up with the best solution possible."
"this seems like a good route to proceed along. abandoned towers should be resources available to the next capsuleer willing to fuel them. absent this some way to salvage a tower for parts without blowing it up would also be a good improvement, a lot of raw materials go into a tower. 90 days is a long time to leave a tower unattended so i think the time frame is more then fair."
"fiddle constans telling people to pvpp wololol"
"so the fact that the tengu receives range, damage and rate of fire bonuses when no other missile-based ship in the game gets those bonuses, is no cause for concern? that t3 cruisers get two bites of the overheating bonuses cherry is no cause for concern?the fundamental error here is you running off on a tangent simply because i brought up an example of how t3s are unbalancing the mission-running aspect of the game. do you dispute that a missile-based tengu performs better in pvp than a cerberus? do you dispute that off-grid boosting allows t3 ships to perform fleet boosting better than a command ship? is overheating irrelevant to pvp combat?"
"t3s are pretty balanced with how expensive they are. for most people it's like buying half a carrier.the only thing i'd be in favor of is upping the training time on it's skills. i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"cerberus, really?i think the main \"balance\" issue here is that you are comparing a 500m-2b isk ship to a cerberus. t3 ships are, for all intents and purposes, the most expensive sub-capital ships that people regularly field in pvp.also, part of the reason those mission hubs are filled with tengu pilots is probably due to the fact that tengu training time is minuscule compared to that of a golem, or faction battleship. although the tengu is probably a little imbalanced in that respect, it's hardly game breaking. only half a carrier? xd my t3 is about the same price as my chimera :p[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"i've had my share of t3 engagements on either side of the gun.from you on the other hand, i'm getting the \"don't nerf my toy\" vibe.with a nerf their price would also come down through reduced demand. without sticking on complex mods on the ship t3's don't get to 2 bil. in fact, the cookie cutter alliance tengu/loki fit is 600-700 mil. that is less than a mach or a carrier and still tengus have way less weaknesses than those (yeah i know, different ship classes, but when people bring arguments like \"it costs so much, it should pwn\" it has to be mentioned)."
"i wouldn't call that a mild nerf. about my only point of agreement is that spread of missile bonuses on the one subsystem that has them. really though, its dps is tied to the bonuses offered by stationary targets and fleet boosting. i've dusted one in a merlin and took almost 0 dps flying in a straight line away from it. autocannon cane and i wouldn't have been so lucky.that's a missile issue of course. weakness of the weapon.if the t3s get nerfed and the market drops, you'll also find a corresponding drop in supply as the wormholers find something more profitable and worth the effort to do. spend some time in a hole and tell me how much fun it is without a crew to bash sleepers. you need some serious incentive to make guys wanna do that.it's a special ship; leave it at that. height of technology, advanced beyond anything the empires have known before.zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub"
"i did say 500m-2b :p most solo t3 pilots will stick on some seriously expensive mods, t2 rigs etc. and those are the t3s that really pwn. as for \"it costs so much, it should pwn\", a carrier plays a different role, and in most fights is considerably more useful than another t3.funny you should bring up pirate faction battleships though, would you fight a bhaalgorn in a tengu? or a machariel for that matter? proteus vs. vindicator?anyway, i'll admit a fleet of 600-700m isk t3s are pretty awesome, especially with logistics support. but then again, if you kill one or two of them even sacrificing a scorpion and a fleet of whelp canes would still leave you isk positive at the end. and if you can't kill them, because you don't have any ewar, logistics or webbers, then you probably wouldn't have won even if they weren't flying t3s.[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"i don't think that a drop of say 20% in the value of sleeper drop would severely reduce the numbers of wh dwellers.that's a rp argument to keep the imbalance."
"as it is for a solo pilot raiding c3s i make only slightly more than i would running incursions, and finding a decent c3 that's empty takes considerably longer than finding a fleet for incursions. that's dual boxing with a pimped t3 and a t3 salvager.take 20% off that and i may as well go back to running incursions, which i don't particularly want to do because they're boring as hell. either that or endlessly scouring forge low sec for the 5/10 and 6/10, which gets equally dull after a while.[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"your income benchmark shouldn't be incursions as they are in dire need of a nerf. their risk/reward ratio is completely out of whack now that running them has been perfected. but that is getting off topic."
"aye, that's true, but unfortunately they won't be nerfed. which unfortunately means things like whs need to be balanced around them.as it is it's pretty close, if you dropped the isk/hour of raiding c3s below that of running incursions, a lot of players would instantly swap professions. especially since to run c3s that fast you need to risk a pretty pimped ship+clone.[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"+1 for having balls.as for this idea, i dunno, i'm a wh dweller so i'm inclined to scream \"get off my lawn\" mainly because i feel that w-space is already suffering badly from highsec incursion iskfountains, w-space has gotten alot more quiet compared to p"
"aye, it seems a lot safer too :(just out of interest, and not to derail the thread, but what class wh do you live in? and what's the pvp like? i was considering swapping to living in whs from raiding them, but the lack of people put me off. only time i've ever found a c3 that was \"populated\" absolutely all of them warped to pos and logged off at the first sign of trouble. eventually they put combats out, but never actually warped in and engaged my bait ship :d[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"this idea is so bad, i don't even know where to start.don't mess with t3s, except to nerf their gang links. alternately, buff the command ship's links so that they return to their proper role in the fleet."
"you should at least try to use like arguments, because right now you only you sound like every other whiny carebear that is afraid their shiny is getting nerfed.fleet cs with t1 ganglinks already gave badass bonuses. t3's with t2 ganglinks are over the top."
"calling floppie a carebear priceless.[center]\"i don't troll, i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but don't want to admit it. it's not my fault that people have sensitive feelings\" -mxzf[/center]"
"good god...let me get this right. you want to nerf t3 ships because they give more bonuses than other ships out there that are a third or even a quarter of the cost? a properly fitted t3 costs 600 mil or more last time i checked. they give the bonuses they do because they cost a lot. they cost a lot because of what it takes to manufacture them. now if there is a balancing issue between the t3 ships i am all for fixing that...but these are \"t3\" ships. they are the best of the best right now. they should be slightly better than a t2 bc but not better than a t2 bs. they should not be worse than t2 bc's and lower. simple as that."
"not especially, when turret ships also have range, damage and rof bonuses. if it's ok for a zealot to have those 3 bonuses, then you need to really go into more detail as to why this is a bad thing.and... doesn't the cerberus get a range, rof and damage bonus? the eve wiki thinks it does:caldari cruiser skill bonus: 5% bonus to kinetic missile damage and 10% bonus to missile velocity per levelheavy assault ship skill bonus: 10% bonus to heavy assault and heavy missile flight time and 5% bonus to missile launcher rate of fire per level"
"leave my tengu alone and bring other t3's up to the same level.instead of crying and moaning for nerfs you guys should spend your useless time posting stuff to improve other t3's and \"mission boats\"...."
"lol seems like i really struck a nerve there. everyone knows the tengu is op. ******* hipocrits."
"the tengu needs a good hard nerf. it has high dps, long range and heavy tank. the other t3's (barring the legion) get to pick 2 of 3. the legion cannot have high dps but gets the other two just fine. i for one rarely use t3's in pvp (not counting off grid boosting). the more specialized recons, bc's and pirate faction cruisers are more effective at a lower cost. about the only role they do better than anything else is the probing cruiser class marauder for exploration. but it has no t2 equivalent in that role to compete with. the only thing on them that needs an across the board nerf is the ganglink subsystem. either cs's need to be buffed to 5% per lvl or t3's need to be nerfed to 3% per lvl. doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me which is done."
"agreed that cs should get the +5% for warfare links while t3s should only get +3%. t3 boosters get plenty of other compensating advantages."
"t3s will be nerfed by the introduction of t4s. we need more t3s available... from frigates on up to battleships."
"from someone who killed 1 loki and sent the other off the field with a 'cane and a friend in a drake:keep the changes small. lengthening the training time of subsystems would be a good idea if something was needed to compensate for any future removal of the exploding-t3 skillpoint loss, and the tengu might be able to do with its missle subsystems rejiggered (making the missile subsystems into a choice between the accelerated ejection bay for high-to-facemelt-dps ham fittings a la the legion counterpart or the rifling launcher pattern for long-range, moderately-high-but-not-uber dps hml fittings would be a good idea imo.) don't go all \"nerfbat-into-ground\" on them as a class though, as the legion would become useless and the loki and proteus would become what the legion is now.as to the t3 vs. pirate faction bs issue...you'd be surprised: for instance, a webbing loki could kite a vindi to death with ease (how is a blaster vindicator supposed to hit out to loki bonused web range?), and even with 800mm acs, the mach still might have trouble with a t3 under its guns. also, the only thing that keeps the tengu from kiting everything under the sun is the lack of a long enough point; if something else (maybe a drag or stop bubble cleverly placed by said tengu pilot?) is keeping the bhaal from warping off in the bhaal vs. tengu case...that's one dead bhaalgorn!also, more and more varied uses for sleeper loot/salvage would be a good thing imo. t3 ammo might be an interesting concept to ponder..."
"imo t3's are a result of ccps inability to find roles for new ships. so they went \"hey lets make modular ships that do it all, just better\", vandalizing the delicate inter ship class balance. if strategic cruisers are any indication of how the other t3s are gonna be, eve would be better off without them."
"i had a 650 dps arty loki with the web subsystem. it was pretty epic in most respects save one, it could only web to about 50km with a faction web and links. i wanted a 100km web, the rapier could provide that while the loki couldn't. i ended up never actually using that loki and sold it after a couple months of it collecting dust. i wasn't afraid to fly it. in fact i kept trying to come up with excuses to. but it just wasn't of any use, our little gangs needed the range of the rapier, not 300 more dps.that situation is presented across most t3 setups. they can do several things at once which is great solo/duo. but in any larger gang you're better off with more specialized ships. and this is completely ignoring cost."
"personally my biggest gripe is that these structures have waaaaaaaay too many hit points, most sov fights i see are two massive fleets maneuvering around one another until one side wins and the other runs for it. then if the attackers win they have a boring structure shoot ahead of them. maybe the improved dread mechanics that encourage more people to use them will mean more dps and less time on structure shoots.honestly as far as hit points go i think that every structure in the game (poses, pi offices, sbus, stations, whatever) should just have enough hit points to discourage the lone ass in an oracle who feels like making you waste stront.also as far as timers go there are just waaaaay too many timers (which take way too many days) to take a system, from the initial fight to online sbus, then you gotta keep em safe, and take out the tcu, and shooting at a station multiple times takes way too long as well.if we are going to redesign sov warfare then the idea of sovereignty needs to come down to one basic question, \"if my enemy and i both had the opportunity to invest all of our resources to fight in one system who would win?\"right now i think the only way to do this in a timely manner is to work the reinforcement timers so that you'd have to have a major battle in every time zone and then just be done with it.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"i like the lone pilot idea! sov warfare might be far more interesting if the lone pilot could indeed quickly take down or temporarily disable tcu's, jump bridges, or pos. raiders could slip into an underused sov system disable the jump bridge defenders would use to repel them and get to the work of plundering assets aka taking everything you have stored in your pos!assets should be protected by human players and not just automated defenses that dictate when the \"clash of the titans\" will take place. then the massive alliances would have to allocate players to defend the systems they hold actively instead of just shuttling a massive fleet of jump clones from one engagement to the next. their massive offensive campaigns would also open the door to their own vulnerability to the opportunistic counter attack from the little guys.let's increase the risk for sov holders and make them continue to earn the rewards of holding a system."
"first off, the csm positively loves frolicking in the mud and other sticky substances, so one should never hesitate pushing them into such or even flinging it at them!secondly, if you merely want an idea peer reviewed then you are in the wrong place .. \"features and ideas\" is down below.as for the polish you are trying to apply to the turd known as \"ehp grind mechanics\" .. give it up. it will never get a shine anyone is happy with."
"yeah that's a good point, granted i'd like a small gang of 5-10 people to be able to mess up a jump bridge, instead of just 1.by the way i have also noticed that if you lower the response time people have it lowers the distance at which people can batphone in their friends. if you want small entities then they'll just need to respond to the things they live next to.i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea"
"the real issue is that a stopped ship realigns parallel to the galactic plane - straightening out, as it were. if i had to guess, this is because of the way movement is handled in eve. you literally do not have direction unless you are moving, so your ship's model returns to the default horizontal position.what should happen is that the direction component of the last movment vector remains, leaving the model properly oriented, while the velocity component is reduced to 0.+1 from me"

"i would have them remove the npcs from plexes and leave it to the players to defend entirely. (thats the other part of the proposal) but if the enemy attacks our military complex then we should know about it. i agree no one wants the job to check all the systems to see if someone is attacking our complex. why wouldn't the complex that is being attacked report it? it doesn't make any sense at all. why not let us know so we can try to quickly react. make the game dynamic and fast paced! just think about it.again the purpose of this proposal is to have eve offer something for people who don't have hours on end looking for fights. eve offers lots of opportunities for those who like to \"hunt\" for hours waiting for a fight. it offers very little for those who don't want to wait hours at a computer screen hoping something will happen and often leaving disappointed. i do not want to change all of eve around. i just want *one* mechanic that brings about frequent quality small scale pvp. fw plexing would do very well. if you like warping around hunting you still could. you can do that in fw or in null sec or as a pirate. that is basically all the game offers now. i joined a militia that is at war for a huge faction! they should tell me where the fighting is going on not just tell me \"go wander around see what you can find.\" imagine if you joined world war 2 (for any side) and they said \"ok take your gun and wander around the world looking for a fight.\" this sort of change may not be for everyone. but the thing is it would provide a something you simply can't get in eve now: frequent quality small scale pvp. by adding something new to what we can do in the sandbox eve will attract more players and keep existing players who may get tired of constantly warping alt scouts around. anyway just think about it. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"taking an hour to update? that hardly sounds fast paced or dynamic. i mean if we want a mechanic in the game where we find out some gang may be in a system so we then all take a half hour to ship up and then when we arrive they see we shipped up and so they either disperse or ship up even higher (leading to no fights and allot of smack talk in local) then the one hour delay sounds good. but really doesn't eve already offer this - in droves? why not have a faster paced more dynamic part of the game that players can participate in if they wish? like i said its only *one* mechanic in the game. i'm not forcing this down everyones throat. if you like to spend hours hunting for a fight you can still do that. really i know allot of people like that about eve and thats great. they can still do that. but why tailor *every* pvp mechanic in the game for people who have lots of time to \"hunt for prey.\" i didn't join a hunting club i joined major a war. i don't want to sit for hours in a tree waiting for a deer to wander by. i want to be thrown into some action. look if there were between 10-40 systems throughout each front that had plexes and the notification system i describe we would all get about 3-7 decent pvp fights in 2 hours of play. doesn't that sound good?make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"

"yes they are, but that's not the primary issue. the remark was a statement on ccps game design. the issue is they offer a very compelling package of dps, survivability and variable extra abilities that is hard to beat. the only real downside is their cost (the skill loss doesn't count as its currently negligible). trying to balance that out via cost is also bad game design at best, look at supercap proliferation for reference.you clearly haven't been doing much 0.0 or wh play lately, or you would know that is not true. the only typical fleet/gang role i don't see much t3's in are logistics, ecm and cap warfare. if you read my opening post you would've seen i support the buffing of specific t3's or aspects thereof.i know you have difficulty understanding it, so let me restate: i don't care about pve. this proposal refers to t3's in a pvp context. i do, however, have the opinion that introducing ships which obsolete entire ship classes (isk not being a factor) and/or are overpowered, is bad game design that actually hurts the gameplay, no matter if in pvp or pve. and mara brought up pve. note: i stopped doing regular missioning/ratting/pve about 2 years ago.by that logic nothing op would ever be nerfed. and seeing that you are only in it for yourself, what are you doing in a proposal that is trying to improve the game? you're a textbook hypocrite."
"classy. also, you complete lack of comprehension of the nature of adhd makes me chuckle, that you think it would prevent me from understanding anything.so why are you replying to my post directed at people who do? and you say *i* have difficulty understanding?but cost *is* a factor. should ccp be balancing deadspace mods so that t2-fitted ships can compete with them? they cost more because they're more effective. t3s, same thing.if t3s make so much obsolete, why aren't they the only ships on the field? right...because they're woefully inadequate as main fleet ships. they do support well, they're great at solo and small gang combat, and they can bring unique abilities to bear, but they will melt in the face of a more balanced fleet.context much? let's go back to the part where i was replying to people complaining about tengus being op in missions.jeebus. and i'm supposed to be the one with a short attention span. edit: you do realize that just because you started this thread, not every reply is about you, right? sheesh, some people think the world revolves around them..."

"i've heard that so many times, and while i agree that ultimately game design should be entirely left up to ccp, i don't think it would hurt the game at all if some of ccp's game designers put their ego's down for a minute and took into consideration some of the kickass game design ideas that some players spend lots of time and energy devising. seriously, what would it hurt? eve's player base is full of smart people and if i were ccp i would make it mandatory for game designers to at least rummage through these ideas and see what good stuff can come from them.edit: i recall this original idea from another thread and i supported it then, so i can't imagine why i wouldn't now. thanks for putting it all together into a pdf, i'll digest it over the next few days if i can. i'll give a pre-emptive +1 based on what i recall from the original thread. great work!\"the world as we know it came about through an anomaly (anomou)\" (the gospel of philip, 1-5)"

"let's take a closer look at new characters.new characters are the only ones who can use the only attribute enhancing booster in the game. not long ago ccp gave them out free with new accounts. you can still get them in boxed editions of eve for the cost of a months subscription. combined with +3s (which takes minuets to train), they get effective +6 implants for 35 days. you can even go for +4s in a reasonable amount of time for +7 effectiveness (bonus: access to various combat implants). add a third neural remap (up until jan. 5th), and new players are in a prime position.remove all of these bonuses and new players will train more slowly for the first critical month*. after that, two +3s or +4s are not expensive. add to that the low cost of low sp clones and now implants are even more affordable to younger players.the real concern, which few are outright saying, is +5s. those are costly**. a young player really cannot afford to lose those, but they can afford them (one at a time) and can keep them in a highsec jump clone (or station bound). many corps have standings that give instant access to jump clones. even still, many argue they are not worth the cost, even in highsec, because they do not make that big of a difference. take two +4s vs. nothing and you see a jump. go from there to two +5s and you only notice it when training high multiplier skills to 5.for older players, you see more complaints about the price of medical clones.* in light of extending trials to two months, i think extending the booster to two months or more is worth considering.** i recommended various cost control methods and proposals in previous posts."
"i support the idea of allowing players up to 6 months to get the training bonuses while us vets are waiting on our month long level 5 skill. this will get them into better ships faster to go do that pvp thing all you young'ns are doin today."

"local is fine. nerfing local will cause major problems. very few want no local like they have in wormholes. but if you do, you have that choice to live there. why screw everyone elses game up?make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"this is exactly why i posted the thread for discussion - to get another view and get people to raise issues with the ideas suggested. i honestly hadn't considered the implications for wormholes. of course there's no reason for that to be an issue. local in wormholes would stay as it is now, this change should only affect regular space. cloak-breaker or cloak-finders could also be very easily restricted too. the supercarrier and sov-based pos mod ideas are obviously impossible to use in wormholes. mods or special scan probes can be made unusable in the same way as cyno gens.i disagree. the main effect should be 'always scared', as you never know if a system you jump into already has a cloaker. i think this will lead to alot more conflict in eve in general, as people who don't take care when moving around will quickly be caught out.another facet of the change is that it rebalances the concept that cloaked people can have an effect on a system simply by being present in it. this is especially evident in the case of stealth bombers camping jumpbridges, who can choose to when to engage, do so already aligned out, and are very hard to trap unless they make a mistake.by removing these bombers from local and stopping them from seeing whats coming, it adds more opportunities for them to be surprised."
"if you'd read that thread, particularly the latter part, you'd have seen more objections against removing cloaked ships from local. yes, removing local from them stops them from seeing what's coming, but that's easily circumvented by having a blue alt in system. what's worse is, however, that these cloaked gangs imply that those who actually inhabit a system has to watch all gates and all wormholes and keep an active anti-incursion gang going 23.5/7. we have a place for that, it's called wormholes. and given all the extra work they'll have to do just to keep a system semi-safe, added with the lack of income and ecitement for those on guard duty, and i'd expect it'd take just a few weeks before nullsec's carebear population drains into hisec to make isk there instead. i don't want nullsec to become even less populous than it already is, we've already seen the effects of the anom nerf on the population, do we really have to see the effect an increase in risk would have?unless, of course, nullsec is increased \"somewhat\" in profitability to make the extra work worth it. and even then i'm pretty sure we'll see a fair bit of carebears migrate back to hisec."

"and this improves on the suggestion of removing cloaked ships from local ... how?"
"that would be me. please be gentle on the quartering.the idea was to find a middle ground regarding removing local and breaking cloaks which wouldn't affect wormholes (where there's already no issues). the idea of cloaked vessels truly disappearing would also end the \"afk cloak\" threads. i'd prefer things be left alone and people grow some balls and stop whining because they're afraid of the person that's not at his computer, but in lieu of some of the horrible \"break cloak\" ideas that people were spewing out there (which would break wormholes by making them safer than high sec) i suggested that."

"you must have low standards, that wall of text contains two arguments and a lot of deflection.i don't see much problem with complex mods except for the mostly lax fitting requirements. they are just more of the same, and the diminishing returns are okay.tengus are the new drakes. every alliance capable of fielding a fleet of them is doing so.stop deflecting. just because you were responding to somebody else's argument doesn't make your stance any less self serving."
"tech 3 are pretty much balanced compared to isk value and skill lossonly real problem i see is offgrid gang boosting which isnt directly related to ships themselvestengu has ordinary caldari advantages for pve but again not problem with ship itself and mission running tengus are easy to suicide for luls."
"....and you completely pass over the analogy i made. if complex mods are okay in spite of their being more powerful than t2 variants, why the whine about t3s?your point? should ccp nerf tengus so drakes go back to being the spammobile? then will you be whining for them to nerf drakes? just because a given ship is the flavor of the month doesn't mean it's op. i don't recall any changes to drakes or tengus for quite some time...why would there be a shift from one to the other? my guess: metagame. drake armies aren't as effective as they once were, because they were so widely used that other fleets developed hard counters to them. when the tengus are consistently trumped, they'll find another ship to blob. you deliberately took my statement out of context and tried to apply it to pvp, which was obviously not my intent. don't accuse me of deflecting when i point that out. here, i'll spell it out, and try to use little words:when you are shooting the little red plus signs, use any ship you want because you are the only person fighting and balance doesn't matter. if one ship does the job better than all the others, use that ship.also: i can't even fly a tengu. i dislike caldari ships and missile boats in general (exceptions made for the sacrilege and vengeance)"
"lol @ \"little red plus signs\"."
"there are no complex mods that increase a cruisers dps and tank from average to that of a bs. nor are there mods that give bs the speed, agility and sig radius of a cruiser. t3's have both.i'm actually liking your train of thought here, although i will disagree with your conclusion. blobs of tengus, in their current form and with the current other ships, will never find a hard counter. there are some tactics that offer a minimum of effectiveness against them, but engagements with similar numbers on each side tend to go heavily in favor of the tengus.another cause for more and more people switching to t3's is the increase in purchasing power, which we already skirted before. which shows another reason that balancing through cost is a bad idea.well, and about the drake, many people including ccp have stated for years that it offers maybe a bit too much in a single package... none of the quotes were taken out of context. your mistake is to believe there is no such thing as balance in pve, therefore you are assuming i am wrongly applying your pve statements in a pvp context.op mission boats are one of the multiple reasons the isk faucets/sinks are out of balance. and again, introducing ships that obsolete all other hi end mission boats is just bad game design.finally, i don't think that the 3 nerf items i proposed are at all unreasonable."

"show me a t3 that gets the dps *and* tank of a battleship. either you fail at fitting battleships, or you've seen some outrageously-fitted t3s. in its covert configuration, my legion deals no damage at all. my proteus will top out doing the damage equivalent of a bc and having the tank of a moderately-tanked bs. unless, of course, i want to drop several billion on the right mods and implants.for now. i don't play in the blob v blob world because it's never interested me, but it's been my experience that sooner or later someone decides there was never even a box to think outside of in the first place and arrives at a really surprising solution to a particularly troublesome problem like a tengu fleet. i'd hate to see creativity lose its place in eve in favor of instant rebalancing every time one ship type or another rises to dominance. mostly because being creative is probably what i'm best at.if the problem is an excess of isk, then you should be advocating a reduction in isk generation, or an increase in isk-sinks to pull it back out of the game. if t3s are a problem now only because people can afford them now, then your real issue is with the supply and demand mechanics.i've seen people running missions in machs and nightmares with nearly as good efficiency as a tengu. shall we nerf them to dial down the isk faucet as well? every ship you nerf for pve, you inadvertently nerf for pvp as well. eve needs more isk sinks and bot countermeasures, not nerfed ships."

"you made me pull some numbers from eft...have a look at the cookie cutter 0.0 fleet tengu: pl tengustrictly t2 fitted, it has 125k ehp (eve-kill and eft dont match), 568dps over the full 117km range (limited by locking range), signature and agility of a cruiser, not to mention very logi-friendly resistances. the only typical fleet bs that has significantly more ehp is the baddon, all others match it at best. quite a few get more dps, but at half the range.i've seen the emergence of a fotm fleet and later a counter to it a couple of times now. some were dealt with by finding the right counter tactic by players (ex: ahacs), others got countered by game changes (ex: the bomber rework killed the snipe bs). i'm not yet seeing the same happen for tengu fleets although they have been around for over a year now.missions and ratting are the biggest isk fountains in the game, their payouts and the speed at which people complete them have multiplicative properties, so if you give players the tools to run through them faster, they will generate more isk in a given time frame. in the case of t3s its even a positive feedback loop: more isk means more people getting into t3 which means more isk. that is why you have to balance pve ships as well.nightmares have become a rare sight tbh; as i don't have experience in pveing in one will take their rarity compared to pimped out tengus as indication they are not (or less) op. not so sure about the mach... @drake: you failed to mention my npc status in your last post."

"the question becomes:is it in the best interest of a new player to be putting them into the biggest ships possible in the least amount of time ?i say no, it isn't in their best interest. the faster you put new players into bigger ships, the worse off they are going to be. a large part of playing this game is learning how to fly your ship. just because you can sit in it, doesn't mean you can fly it. a new player who joins a corperation right out of the gate has people to guide them along but lets face the facts. there are a lot of players who don't join a corperation for months. those players often have no one to guide them along. if we're looking to help new players, then we need to think what is best for all players. not just the ones helping you pvp. max sp/hour is not always a good thing. especially when you have no idea what your doing."

"enough with the statistical shenanigans. percentage of characters does not equal percentage of players. there are 3 characters per account and a very large number of players have multiple accounts.there's some seriously faulty logic going on here by some to justify the status quo. just because players choose to make isk in high sec does not mean they want eve to keep risk/pvp free pve. i think local chat intel is terrible game mechanics, but i take full advantage of it all the same. all players except perhaps the most dedicated roleplayers choose the path that will lead to the greatest reward and advantage.rambling on about how only 7% of characters spend time in worm holes is some indication that local chat intel removal is unpopular is also faulty as there's more differences between wormhole space and the rest than simple delayed local.and zim talking about high sec incursions being some critical training ground for group flying, completely ignores that players have been doing that fine in eve for several years prior to pve raids in the form of incursions.all risk free pveing needs a massive nerf, buffing null anomalies while leaving local and continuing incursions in high sec is hardly the answer."
"what other hisec pve activity requires the same level of coordination between a bunch of players in this game?nullsec pveing is hardly \"risk free\"."
"so the more people we coordinate with is now going to be the measuring stick of how much isk we should make? seems largely irrelevant to me.no i suppose there is some risk if your both careless enough to do it afk and honest enough not to be botting. the danger of null sec is only in traveling via gates, a risk virtually eliminated by being part of one of the big alliances and staying in home territory."
"you are right about the high sec numbers being inflated. but its unclear that wormholes numbers are deflated. many wormhole players keep at least one alt in their wormhole just incase they get podded right?so while the high sec numbers are very likely inflated and the null sec and low sec numbers are deflated its unclear whether the wormhole numbers are deflated or inflated due to that extra alt being kept there. sure maybe not everyone in the corp has an alt there but many will. the biggest difference between empire and wormholes is the lack of local. yes wormholes need to be scanned but that is not a big deal. the fact that wormholes can close and bounce you on another side of the universe is a pretty big deal too but you can see if its about to close. the biggest difference is the no local so you have no way to tell what sort of numbers you may be up against. going into a place with no local for pvp is just begging to get blobbed. but if wormholes had local many more people would go there for pvp.make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"you seem to be under the illusion that people choose to play in empire or wormholes based on the presence or absence of local. people aren't in empire because of local or in wormholes because of the absence of local."
"please. if wormholes had local pvp would be decimated. it would be impossible to plan any types of ops covertly. people would dock up at the first sign of a stranger. it would suck the life out of wormholes altogether. it would become as safe as high sec sadly. fortunately nothing that stupid would ever happen."
"are you naturally this thickheaded, or are you just trolling? it's almost like i haven't said that hisec incursions could easily do with a nerf to payouts, and the only thing i'm definitely arguing against is the complete removal of hisec incursions.doesn't even need to do it afk to lose a ship, all it takes is not watching the intel channels, and a few seconds of not noticing reds/neuts in local, if you're unlucky."
"unless you can reliably stick an empty velator anywhere in a system over an extended period of time, and not get podded, then it's not going to be as safe as hisec. safer than now, yes, but not as safe as hisec, that's taking it too far."
"no, this is a terrible idea and if there was a -1 option i'd be hammering that. the tears over cloaks is ridiculous, it doesn't need a \"counter\" because it counters itself by making the pilot incapable of actually doing anything."
"except it doesn't prevent them from running around and choosing juicy targets, which is a fairly nice advantage to have."
"which could be why you have to train cloaking to iv and fly special ships to do it."
"the only reason you can do that in high sec is basically because no one cares about a free noob ship floating around out there. it's not worth getting concordokken over. in a wormhole, that's a target of opportunity... either someone that doesn't belong there or someone that you want to remove for control purposes. although, with those damnable cloak breaking probes, you probably could leave a velator parked somewhere as long as you had people manning the probes (would become required) and keeping the cloakie on the run if one should show up. so yeah... those probes would effectively make wormholes nearly as safe as high sec."
"no. it'd still be more dangerous than nullsec."
"nearly as safe as high sec and more dangerous than null sec.you seem to be coming around that null sec is already safe enough without nerfing it further by breaking cloaks. it's already quite clear that being able to scan down a cloaked vessel would make wormholes incredibly safe places to live... no one would ever have a chance to be in a hole long enough to hunt a random target, gather intel in preparation for an op, anything. wormhole pvp would die."
"it's wh > nullsec > lowsec > hisec. there's no way whs can get even close to hisec by that minor change.as to cloaks, i'd find it hilarious if cloaks consumed some sort of fuel if just to make staying cloaked in a single system for a few days in a row actually require effort, but i'm way more interested in shooting down awful suggestions that'd completely **** over the precarious balance that determines the nullsec population."
"minor? minor? you really need to start paying attention or at least learning the game a little before you go blathering on about things.let's state it again, not that you'll actually pay attention.if you could scan cloaked ships down with probes, for example, these would become required items in wormholes. it would become one of the first things you do when logging on, when anything is happening, etc. to have these probes out looking for cloaked vessels... much like it's common practice to keep a skynet of probes out looking for new k162s that may appear. so, what's this mean? if someone comes (or is in) your hole cloaked, you get a ping that there's a cloaked ship somewhere. the relentless hunting begins. you begin to attempt to scan him down continually, and if you're trying to protect your hole you never stop until he's either caught or leaves, period. you coordinate with someone else (if required) who has combats out in case he logs... you go for the quick hit and kill. it would become impossible to be in a hole with the intent of preparing for an invasion, for example... you couldn't stay in there to scan the opening for a fleet... you couldn't park off the pos and gather intel. it would become ungodly easy to lock the system down to any unwanted visitors that you would decimate wormhole pvp, completely breaking the system.odds are that you won't admit to understanding this... goons troll after all. if that's you're game you're playing it well btw. but... others understand. ccp certainly does as well."
"sigh. it's a minor change, just like \"remove local\" or \"remove cloaked ships from local\" is a minor change. it's not something ccp could spend months on implementing, unless they're totally hopelessly incompetent.i know perfectly well what the impact of that change is, and it's still not getting anywhere near hisec-safe."

"wormholes have so little pvp as it is, if they were completey removed it wouldn't \"decimate pvp.\"people who pvp know that when local is full of a targets friendlys, if they attack that target they will get blobbed. so not allot of pvp happens in those systems unless people are dumb or new. when you see very few in local or about your numbers you know you have a good chance of a good fight. so lots of fights happen that way. thats why you see so much pvp in low sec and null sec compared to wormholes.when you have no local you are just asking to get ganked. and indeed the number of ganks versus gfs from wormholes far outstips those numbers in null or low sec. that is why allot of pvpers don't go into wormholes. i never said allot people go into wormholes because there is no local. i am saying the opposite many people don't go into wormholes because it has no local. there are plenty of good reasons to go into wormholes. you can make more isk as a carebear than pretty much anywhere in game. you are relatvively safe since there is relatively little pvp there. many of the people in wormholes have very little pvp experience so it should supply kills. you can do industry etc. given the amont of isk ccp throws at wormholes you would think about 35% of the player base would be there. but its not. the biggest difference between wormholes and every other area of space is no local. yes wormholes can close and move but that is not that big of a deal because you can tell when it is about to collapse. the biggest problem for pvpers is when you go in and attack someone its a complete crap shoot as to whether you are going to get blobbed. its like flipping a coin who will get blobbed you or the other guy. imo coin flipping isn't really a fun game. make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve"
"nice bro-stash you got going on there. kinda creepy. you look like the sort parents won't let their children near.summary of eves last four expansions:"
"you mean like this proposal?get out"
"hear hear!i agree completely. lets get back to our grass roots and bring back the issues that really matter.lolsummary of eves last four expansions:"
"have to agree with drake and danika on this one. it's hardly fair that not every system is within 1 jump of a major trade hub. or they are not close to an ice belt. i could go on and on with this but i think you get the picture.it's not really a problem and if any change is made because of this, where does it stop?it's not that much of an issue to fly to a system to redeem your lp. just as it isn't that much of an imposition to fly to a major hub to sell things. that's life i am afraid.strongly disagree with this proposal."
"this proposal, which i believe is a reasonable and practicable proposition, is not really about the inconvenience of travelling 15 jumps to visit a concord station, it is about equity and equality. to reiterate, there is a big imbalance in the spread of concord stations, metropolis has 9 while two whole regions like tash murkon and amarr have not one between them. every high - sec region has at least one trade hub it's inhabitants can access within its space, is it it too much to ask that tash murkon and amarr also have at least 1 concord station apiece.as for this current proposal, where does it end? when the residents of tash murkon and amarr have access to concord stations within their own regions. as for anyone else having access to concord stations there more than welcome to join this lobby . i hope more people will come on board and give their support for this proposal."
"this isn't the rp forum...your posting in the wrong place.concord space neighbors amarr space...everyone knows this....you apparently don't know where it is.suggest setting your navigation system to yulai in the gensis region... there you can find all the concord stations you want.welcome to eve online.================ stop the evemail spam!"
