the op couldnt be more wrong if they lived in wrongvillesure limit boosts to ongrid that wont have the effect you think it will
just remove the command processor module hey presto no 6link ship alts fleet command ships get back their eminence in gang bonuses it wouldnt stop possedup fleet command alts of course but its a move towards balance
i think eve has more than enough content to be working on without trying to add new ships new skills and a bunch of new items to make scavenging a new miniprofession
by that reasoning we should never try anything new until everything in eve works perfectly dont be daft this is a well thought out idea with a very simple basic structure 2 modules and some support skills allowing for quick introduction while also giving plenty of options for later iterationsupported
any more comments thoughts or ideas out there
posting of the mittanis real life address is harassment invitation to mischief beyond anything he said or did at fanfestthreat to his wife is no joke can never tell who is a sick joker and who is truly deranged but thats not for ccp or any of us to sort out thats for the police to investigatebut just as in rl if you want to run for any kind of office its not unreasonable to require that you give up some of your expectation of privacy and that you accept greater responsibility for all your words and actionsyou are going to speak for us be one of our public faces we should know and be able to verify who you are not your ingame persona your ingame self may be a villain your reallife self honorable but it might also be the other way around many good reasons not to want that kind of scrutiny some bad either case dont stand for office
exactly this is either a knee jerk reaction or more liang being a propaganda shill for the mittani the suggesting is short sighted and silly these people represent all of the players you know the risks of losing the anonymity shield going in we cannot and should not have people with that kind of shield to hide behind making input calls into development cycles they are still elected representatives i want to know the man as much as the character he uses in game when i vote for them the irl person matters more to me then their characters i cant get and honest gauge of jack crap about a person if they are hiding behind their avatar and the persona of the avatar knowing the real person matters people act very different when they think they are anonswhen voting for a csm rep you should be voting for the person not the character they play in game since that person is the one that will be making the calls and giving input not the character this suggesting is just crazyspace wizards are real they can make 10058 votes vanish and for a moment i hurd 10k goons cry out then silence 
having their real name isnt knowing them at all and if you believe that for a second then you have a learning disability
you talk about this like it is real life politics this is spaceship politics all this talk about accountability has an underlying implication of revenge or consequences if something illegal happens then ccp has the name anyway there should be no way for a player to be harassed out of game using info from ccp they shouldnt be forced to mix their eve personalities and real life to be on the player council in game stuff needs to stay in game
your bias is showingwhile i can sympathize with not being progoon i think the benefit you get from requiring disclosure is almost negligible you as a voter could of course decide to only vote for candidates who disclosethe rest should sort itself out fineas far as crazy i saw you on twitter raging along and then defending someone posting mittanis real life address or where you defending the guy who threatened to sexually assault his wife or are you that guydo you also defend spike lees actions posting that address of that couple named zimmerman recently would you have if it had been the right zimmermanone wonders why you hate the goons so much considering your own goonish behavior i think you are overdue for a long hard look in the mirror

signedone has to wonder why certain parties are so desperate to have public real life information on people from eve people who have either sparked controversy or are in positions such as the csm this adds a very scary stalkish feel to the eve playing atmosphere one in which we must be fearful for real life retribution in the form of threats or even someone carrying them through seriously whats to stop someone just finding this info go to the address and take action in some violent malicious way people might say goons are horrible they eat children punch pregnant mothers etc but ive never heard one threaten someone in a violent real life way only in ways that involve violencing their spaceships there is no reason i need to know any of the csms real names nor anyone else outside ccp
and what justifies that risk
in my opinion anonymity for csm candidates wont workat the end of the day toons are pixels on a screen the people on the csm are the players the people behind the toons since those people are representing the players as a whole to ccp the players need to know who the people behind the toons are because in most cases those people are very different from the toons they playnot signed
and how does you having his name make that person come out
i dont support this if someone wants to be among the few representing the entire playerbase and have such perks as an allexpense paid trip to iceland they can do us the courtesy of revealing such basic information as their name and country of residence for me it is more the principle here i could maybe get behind striking their country but not their name i think running for csm should involve opening up to the playerbase enough to share their real name
i wouldnt call attending meetings in iceland a country whose only real attraction for tourism is fishing a perk
let me quote a piece of the op here because i think it really addresses your objection on the basis of courtesy nicelyliang
i support this idea while it wont matter much to those of us serving currently this is certianly something that in light of recent events is going to be discussed with ccp by the members of csm 7
its the people who think having the name out there will keep them accountable with the underlying implication that in game things will be met with out of game reprisals as if the names are leverage for a disgruntled player those are the people who genuinely worry me and i imagine the csm members feel the same some of you are creepyunbalanced  people
how exactly does having their real life names make them any more accountable than if you dont is this so people unhappy with them can make threats on their pets and spousesim sorry but thats total rubbish a name doesnt make a bunch of pixels any more real to you except if you want to go after them in real lifethe negative responses are very worrying its a game you shouldnt have to know what or who these people are outside of it even for the csm i dont exactly want to know where my elected politicans in my country live or do outside their official capacity and i dont think i need to know either
wasnt and issue beforeall the sudden mittens gets in trouble and its a jihad to hide from the public dont want to give up your name dont run space wizards are real they can make 10058 votes vanish and for a moment i hurd 10k goons cry out then silence 
this has literally nothing to do with the mittani because his real name is already well known do try to stay on topicliang
more like wasnt an issue before then a halfpsychotic playerbase decided to send a sitting csm member actual rl threatssounds like a very good reason to stop giving out players personal info to me
i am eidric and i support this post
given some peoples hysterical over reaction i have to support this idea 1 to you sir
this is not about mittens he has been banned you can take the tin foil hat off now you spent days in the threadnaught tearing into mittens for what he did and yet when he is the victim of far worse than he ever inflicted on anyone else you refuse to even consider a proposal that will prevent such real life harrassment happening again hypocriteand before you call me a goon alt im not this is my main i do like goons though  in the same way i like all major alliances that can have 90 dudes in a system but are afraid of two dozen noobs in t1 cruisers all hail goon bravery
well most of the time i agree with you liang but that is absurd the argument has been abused countless times in history only when convenient ofc by that logic all persons somehow exposed to publicity would have to run with pseudonyms imagine rl politics running anonymously lol and it doesnt end there if you want to keep anonymity for csm members youd have to avoid public appearances or broadcasts at least with voice and image scrambling because someone might identify them and quite obviously with prominent use of facebook noone seems to give a fckcsm happens in meatspace and the idea to make it work like a virtual space is bound to fail also revealing some personal details adds some accountability to the csm candidacy which i find highly desirablei have to agree with rogueoperator if youre not ok with that dont run
why they originally chose to release names in the first place is beyond me but info such as nationality and occupationeducation can not be used to identify an individual so canshould be available
this does nothing but bring about an obvious exploitable situationthis makes it entirely too easy to run counter shadow campaigns and pack your voting bloc oh thats right the goons are all for this makes sense now
signed
signedwormholes have the best accoustics its known  sing it for me 
you really do have an unhealthy obsession with goons you do realise they arent actually that great
signed but with a caveatwhile i agree that giving real life information about csm members and candidates to the sociopathic collective known as eve players is generally unnecessary there is one circumstance where this information is relevanti have seen several candidates attempt to win over voters by telling us about their personal life work experience etc if the csm is anonymous and the voters have no way of verifying such information then candidates should not be allowed to use their personal life as a platform for electionother than that little caveat im 100 in agreement video games are not worth rl threats and harrassment and ccp needs to protect the players who step up to the challenge that is the csmyargle
x singed
this is not real life and these are not real life politicians please separate the two quite firmly in your mindlianged also i am extremely concerned about the people who keep insisting that real life information is required to keep csm candidatesdelegates accountable
ccp is more than capable of providing a vetted and verified biography of each csm candidate theres no need for any of us to go around calling their irl boss to verify their claims about work in an internet spaceship gameliang
i tend to think of the csm as a more or less public office more more than less where actual people do the job yes it is first and foremost a business relationship between ccp and csm reps which does not require full disclosure but i tend towards wanting to know who i am voting for as the person behind the character with a history wider than the max 9 years lifespan of a capsuleerlet existing legislation be the protection most western countries while late in adopting appropriate laws have a solid basisno representation without realism
its pretty easy to clear out anything specific from the bios and still be able to know you candidate also existing legislation isnt enough to stop the creepy people the mittani is in the us and yet still people are threatening to  his wife to death and kill his dog now i understand how this is outweighed by your need for realism but
more or lessnote that its goon supporters and petsalts that are pushing this it also opens the door for fraud against the voting playersspace wizards are real they can make 10058 votes vanish and for a moment i hurd 10k goons cry out then silence 
no it does notwe get it you want to harass csm members irl when they support things you dont like but that doesnt quite help your case
in theory someone running for csm in his proper person and not as an anonymous toon is less likely to simply lie his way into office and is less likely to abuse whatever small amount of power the office affords him once hes there because he or she will feel more accountableone obvious counterargument is that anyone can turn into a publicly drunken douchebag after being elected note this is not intended to be a dig at alex most people have the capability to be douchebags if sufficiently disinhibited including me and yes politicians lie all the timebottom line though is that i want someone whos campaigning for a position where he will be representing me to feel a level of personal accountability for postelection actions and i dont feel like making candidates or csm representatives anonymous is a good answer to situations like the recent threats to alex et al a better answer to those threats is temporary bans handed out by ccp i think
signingproviding real names to the public wont make people more or less accountable but it will open the doors for less than sane people to take less than savory actiona good example of this was the system that blizzard set up the one where the forums would use peoples real life names instead of the their characters names so that people could be held accountable for what they said andor trolledguess what people still trolled and the system was abandoned after mountains of concerns were brought to blizzards attentionhonestly real names wont grant anyone the ability to really know the person they are voting for or allow them to hold said people more accountable they will still be just that names until you step outside of the game and try to do something with that name which isnt really kosher by any standard or ruleand at the end of the day this is a game nothing more nothing less an election system pertaining to a game should be taken no more seriously than a game of rockpaperscissors that you play with your friends to decide where your next road trip is going to be
they have a level of personal accountability that comes from ndas and contracts with ccp the player base does not need their real name country of origin address resume or any other real life information to guarantee thisliang
i never did understand why real names needed to be provided to the player base
no see post 2 by mara rinn just because your alliances candidate selfdestructed and you dont get to put another goon in his place doesnt mean it wasnt democratic
kick amokdot
the person who will be replacing the mittani on csm 7 is someone that other players voted for who would otherwise not have had a voice on csmit might not be fair but it is certainly democraticseems to me ive heard a certain group wax eloquent over the inherent unfairness of eve before i wonder who that was
are you referring to the random blog post on april 1st by some random player claiming that someone who barely made it into the top7 of the csm is going to be chairing the csm ha
no i must have missed that one
i pay my npc corps taxes and my subscription i feel at home in my npc corp why should i pay monthly iskies on top of that
this idea could add a lot to things like mining etcdevelop shields that offer extended protection against space phenomena and than you could safely mine in storm for a time but only with said shields could also be done for missionsit makes sense that a pirate organization would hide an outpost in a dangerous portion of space as they have developed a way to shield against it once a ship is destroyed a bpo could drop for said shield tech and then manufactured by the player baseresearch could also be done to adapt said shield to a pos and allow players to oust said pirate faction and place pos with new shield tech in plasma storm nebula radiation etcas player corps begin to hold these dangerous areas of space it would add a new dimension to wars as the attacking corp would have to develop the same shielding tech before it becomes feasible for them to attackjust my 2 cents anyway
ironically the naga is also the tier 3 that requires the least amount of training to get into as its bonuses mean even meta guns are almost as effective as tech 2 when used within its niche it doesnt need spikes range boost because it has one anyway and javelin just doesnt compare to faction antimattertrain large hybrids to 4 and decent support skills which you need anyway adn you already get 8590 of the effectiveness of the t2 fit
1the guns exist to deter any would be attacks on gatesstationsyou are reasonably safe traveling through low sec if you think before leaping in
i disagree that the current system is flawedthose that want to vote vote those that want to have a voice use it those that want to be that voice volunteer thats the way a democracy works and thats what the csm is supposed to be a democratically elected body of the playersif you feel your voice is under represented you have a year or so to get a platform and following together for next year my people on this coming csm have shown that you dont need a 00 backing to get on since of the 14 members only 5 are from entrenched 00 entitiesthis csm has representation for every single facet of eve 00 wh space low sec and high sec all fairly well represented your idea is called a lottery and it can be used for many things but electing the representation of the player base isnt it
just because you only use one char on your account doesnt mean no one uses them for anything except voting or anonymous posting there are many valid uses for characters stuff like different specialized characters to keep clone costs down pi price checking holding alts trying out other areas of the game like a fw alt if your main has good standings spy alts and many other uses dont try and break other peoples use of the game just because you arent using something
i also use my other 2 slots on my accounts for cyno alts and trading toonsbut this is not the pointl you will never get rid of the multiaccount per person volting in the csm unless ccp changes the rules for volting people will always have more then one account as ccp restricts you to be only able to log into one pilot at a time many players like to multibox you wont be able to do this on one account people should be able to vote for each of their accounts as the more active accounts they have the greater the interest in the game they have just becuase you own a 100 shares in a coumpany doesnt mean your vote at the agm is only counted once it is counted for all the shares you have otherwise you would have the minority share holders dictating what the majority do
so the people who cannot afford multiple accounts and a system for multiboxing should have fewer votes than those who can that doesnt seem like a good idea to me personally
hi i have 2 accounts each with 1 character with 90m sp 1 with 30m sp and 1 with 1m spyou can rest assurred that i didnt train 30m sp into those secondary alts for no reasonso yes you may indeed be leaving a few reasons out
there are easy work arounds to this i still use those 2 character slot issuesa account comes with 1 active slot and 2 nonactive slots and additional active slots may be purchasedas for multiboxing a subaccount system could be put in place to allow multiple active characters to be online at once on the same accounti do not think that people who have multiple accounts should be able to multiple vote i have multiple accounts yet i only voted for the mittani with one of my accounts i stand true to my belief
good for youi have six cynopitradervb alts i use them all i suppose youd take four of them away from medo you not think the sub account system might complicate things a little or compromise account security lose one account lose literally everything rather than just 13 and how about spying your system would remove it entirelyin short no csm voting isnt worth screwing up every other aspect of eve
an overly complicated playerpunishing solution to a problem that isnt even a problemeveo forums ladies and gentleman
mostly use mine as cyno altsanyway theres a good argument that says if i pay for 3 accounts then why shouldnt i have 3 votes
yeslets break the game in the name of fair voting for csmgreat ideanot stop the evemail spam
best arguement so far
just because you are too dumb to use alts dont mean others need to followhere are a list of important things alts can do on same account1 be ceo or in corp that main is not hold on to that special name main runs one corp and is in alliance executor2 cyno alts3 differently trained chars one industry one low sp pvp one massive sp pvppve 4 jita price checker5 trade alt trading is a skill that you dont need to be logged in to make isk and using more alts means more orders6 supercap char or alt to hold on to one because being locked in a ship realy dampers paying the rest of the game on the same char7 anything else that is much less important8 planetary interaction even lower sp to max than trading and can multichar with itif you pay the game like a pro yes you need alts if all you do is run level 4s in empire then by all means biomass alts or shitpost with them
i am against that since then you could see for example for wartargets if they are really on or just afk in station or cloaked up somewhere wartargets as in both wartargets and neutralsred in low and 00
fofs dont do much less damage than any other missile type the problem with them is you cant control what they hit so you tend to find if you have multiple enemies the damage gets spread out rather than focusedstill useful if you are jammed by a falcon at range with a dps ship close to you fofs will hit whats closest or largest then work out from theretotally useless in missions or complexes as they also target structures that can be destroyed
idc that its harder to get out of a wardeck you can still just leave the corp and get out of it in a day but you should be able to pay for the wardeck to continue if the attacking corp no longer wishes to pay now your the attacking party and can try to force them to surrender
i spent more isk therefore i should win
due to events this past week we really need this as an option
i have somewhat followed the issue and i keep coming back to the same thought why would for instance the us call up the country they are at war with or whomever and say we need to redesign your tanks i think that is the whole purpose of arms races between countries in rl wouldnt it be a better idea to install a sub cap ship that can deal with such things maybe a variation of a super cap or a dread type ship that can take em on in the fieldi have heard that it is basically the end of training also getting into your titan and a long investment in time i just think it should be more of an advance for the game rather than trashing it so to speak to make it more even
the problem with introducing a new ship designed to kill a fleet of something that is too powerful at the moment is that once you have a fleet of those ships what keeps it from becoming the next op ship then you have to introduce a new ship to beat your new ship that beats the old shipif your only going to introduce a ship as a way of balancing an existing ship you need to make sure that your not just creating a new problem once you take all of the effort that entails into account you have spent more time on the project than simply balancing the old ship would have takenyour military example doesnt quite work here because this is a game not real life the game needs to be balanced and each ship needs to have counters otherwise it becomes a game of who can field the highest numbers of the most powerful ship
supported csm7 should push to get bounty hunting fixed also you need a system that lets people bounty hunt in highsec without fear of concord
i understand ccp soundwave has said this is not on their 1 year plan but this would do more to fix high and low sec than anything else in the game ive seen yeti also agree kill rights transferability or something needs to be included otherwise it does nothing to increase the self policing of highsec
double issue maybe merge
tldr the destroying of rigs makes it very difficult to relocate staging points and consolidate pilot assets not destroying rigs  more fights straightforward market member satisfactionpros corporations and alliances can move around more freely makes it easier to get into pvp action less boring logistical work ships modules and rigs can be seeded back into the market in the place people tend to look for them stockpiling becomes viable  more isk poured into the marke freighters become more useful used more therefore empire wars have a bigger purpose though easily circumvented with alts lower hesitation to deploy battleships cons less demand for rigs  less production  higher rig prices not necessarily a bad thing  as the ceo and main logistical overseer in my corp ive for a long time struggled with the moving around of the war chest of my corporation and its members like now were looking around to deploy in different areas to be able to find some fights using carriers to move ships in a current scenario id have to spend upwards of 45 million per round trip to move four battlecruiser hulls a fairly hefty pricethe other option is the use of a freighter which at lvl 5 can hold a maximum of 9375kmUFFFD roughly 4 bc hulls in courier form this is still a pretty high number if you consider that in packaged form its only 15kmUFFFD as opposed to 216kmUFFFD in full formevidently this makes logistics an unnecessary nightmare while we only want to have good fights without having to worry about keeping strict rules about how many ships to bring and making it risky to assemblefit ships knowing that they will add to the volume that will inevitably need to be moved againthough a new shiptype can be introduced with a large ship hangar sans jumpdrives to tackle the logistical issue alone i think the merits from removing rig destruction completely weigh heavier i also think that codewise this is the easiest and most effective implementationlike this if well you like the idea or at least agree that theres too many negative effects imposed by rigs if you disagree give thoughtthrough and constructive critiscism please
 this pretty sums up the reason i am against your proposed change it is supposed to be a hassle to move your equipment around especially if you have added the extra edge to your ships which rigs pretty much are an edge that is relatively cheap and more widely available compared to other optionsits already too easy to move around and project power to different locations within a relatively short period of time the only saving grace is that it is a tedious chore to perform said power projection due to little things like rigs and ammunition
soooolowering the demand incrase the pricesyou better start running the invisible hand is going to slap your ass
well at first due to installed production and stocks the price will go down but if the activity goes low volume low price for long it might become less attractive to builders and the offer will also decrease wich could either balance it out or put the prices even higher or lead even to unavailability of some less demanded mods
lower volume trades are more prone to market manipulation if you know youll not sell as much volume as before youll want to raise the prices to compensate for the loss of net profit
rigs are cheap compared to everything else you put on this ships consider them disposable and trash a few for your convenience
also thisequals even easier force projectionits too easy to move large quantities of stuff into a fight on short notice right now lets not make that even easier
destruction drives the eve economy if rigs arent getting destroyed there will be less demand less demand means less production and higher prices you seem to already have this principle downhowever you missed something important higher rig prices means less players are able to afford to uselose them remember when there was only one rig size yeah it was very common to see rigs costing more than the fitted ship itself ccp changed it into various sizes to make rigs available and affordable for everyone not just the rich with disposable incomenon destructible rigs is a bad idea all aroundplus i have a substantial market investment in rigs so im biasedsummary of eves last four expansions
well get over yourself rigs were intentionally made to be destroyed when the ship is repackaged it wasnt a mistake on ccps part it was a design decision
i thought personal consequences for spaceship game actions was what got us in this whole mess in the first place
i think you miss my intent accountability to ccp is all well and good but thats almost entirely directed at not disclosing ccp proprietary information without ccp permission ive been a member of a similar body for the past several years theres a code of conduct we are required to abide by which pretty much boils down to dont be a douchebag and there is an nda which we must honor i assume the csm is no different once youre electedif players are to vote for csm candidates though i feel those candidates also have a level of accountability to the players that vote for them without that accountability the csm might as well be a star chamber i dont feel like i need all the little details of the players life but i do feel that csm members or candidates owe me a bit more than some random playeras for protecting csm candidates and members past and present i honestly think that this is something ccp should step up a bit on if someone makes rl threats against a csm then ccp should take some action im aware that ccps current policy is that out of game communications are no business of ccps and i know of some sickening rl threats that have been made over the years where ccp said contact your local law enforcement if you think theyre serious but i feel that they do have a responsibility to people who are in the public eye as csm members beyond the general policywhile i wont argue against the your contention that csm candidatesmembers need more protection than they get today i dont feel that anonymity is the right way to get it
umm no alex plays the mittani but he isnt the toon i hope what he did irl is what got us into the current little mess
thats the whole point though what mittens did was considered to be bad because it could have caused rl consequences for the wis and all because of something that the wis did within a spaceship game all this outrage and not a shred of actual rl info was given  imagine if you will that the target of said comment would have been either a current or former csm member where their rl info was actually available on evelopedia guess what you dont even need to imagine it as mittens is catching a lot of rl harassment over this im not saying to garner sympathy or anything just to suggest that the playerbase of this game is not only capable of taking things far beyond the boundaries of the game but theyre quite willing to do it its time to accept that and remove the csms public information to at least attempt to prevent this from happening again whatever marginal benefits someone might gain from having a candidates rl info are massively overweighed by the downsides especially in light of this debacle
yeah i know sucks tbh and i feel for him even though ive never met him i think he should forward some of the more egregiously offensive stuff to ccp and hold their toes to the fire to help do something about it a few 30 day bans would be a good place to startbut i think complete anonymity will breed a star chamber atmosphere and ultimately destroy what good the csm is capable of doing
i think that the first place you go with him catching rl harassment over this is he should tell ccp shows that you really just dont even get what rl harassment means in this case ill give you a hint the people doing it arent exactly attaching their character names to it and its not happening within the game itselfremind the audience again how having their rl names public contributes anything
they do owe you more than a random player but you dont need their in game name to get it that you will get what you are guaranteed isnt for you to guarantee yourself but for ccp to guarantee for you furthermore none of us really know much more about the csm members than theyve chosen to share with us directly  and even that is mostly us taking their word for it ultimately weve stepped way over the line the moment any of us tries to act on the real life information we are currently being giveneffectively the only possible uses you can have for this information are to give you some sense of empowerment over the csm members or to literally escalate in game retribution to real lifeccp takes threats of rl escalation very seriously and i have it on good authority that they dont hesitate to contact local law enforcement however thats going to be cold comfort when someone ends up assaulted in the real world what youre asking for is effectively impossible and what im suggesting is the only practical response that we can havewe have no need of this information and we have proven that we do not have the responsibility or sanity to be trusted with it your feelings that they owe you be damnedliang
i support this
let us create a hypothetical situation one where you have won a seat on the csm and have had your name and some details about you such as your country and such made publiclet us then suppose you do something something controversial something that stirs up the emotions of several players with a large emotional investment in this game and many do have far too much of an emotional investment in what is just a game these players are furious they are angry some are so angry theyre willing to do something about it they manage to find your information your address your place of work they even manage to track down your schedule when youre at home when youre out and the like they wait until youve gone out and are well away then they enter your home find your loved one let us suppose you have one if you do not already and then they harm them in someway they might just assault them or if they are unhinged enough angry enough they might even go further you then come home to find your loved one sprawled out in a pool of their own bloodnot a pretty scenario in any way yes its a worst case scenario but recent events have shown that some players are willing to at least do some of the above who knows how much more might be done in the future if the wrong thing is saiddone by a csm member lets not let it come to that let us keep our csm members safe
never did and dont understand why anyone other than ccp needs to know personal details to be a spaceship game politiciansigned
as a player who has suffered my fair share of real life harrassment from goonswarm and friends ever since my real name was provided to the community as part of my successful csm 1 run i could certainly see the argument for going back in time and reversing this policy in retrospect sure the fact my real name was provided to enemies in eve allowed some people to search for my online cv take my pictures find my employers past and current and begin an organized campaign of harrassment against my real identity sites were created specifically to portray me in the worst possible light and links were provided to my place of work along with letters perporting to be from concerned parents that a person like me should be playing an online game even today real life photograph is hosted on the goonwiki alongside the accusation im putting ghb into childrens drinks so yes real life harrassment does certainly arise from the fact that csm candidates are required to give their real names because some subscribers to this game are completely incapable of keeping their animosity to ingame only behaviour at this point i will support your topic to remove peoples real life names from the process on the provisio it goes further and makes any unauthorized link to somebodys personal detals photographs a eula breaching offence punishable by a signifcant ban out of game harrassmentbullying must be completely outlawed in eve online if this game is to repair its toxic reputation in the wider gaming community and incidently i would like to call upon the administrators of the goonwiki to remove all reference to my rl photograph and allegations of criminal activity otherwise i will again petition the gms at ccp to take action in this case
i could not agree more  thanks jade ill hit you up about the rest of your request  i at least have a couple of ideas on how to approach that given the fact that goons have no control over that siteliang
serious question would you include the eveo forums as ingame or out of game as much of the meta gaming happens here and not just here but on unofficial forums where everyone api registers as their main toon  is that ingame as people are still only displayed as their toon or out of game as it is out of the control of the gmsi do agree that out of game harrassment should be cracked down on when proven but where do you draw the line between ingame and out of game its a grey area and i personally do not know the answersedit also the comment on your real life photo page is clearly tongue in cheek and not a serious accusation  but your real life photo has no business being on that website without your permission so should be removed along with the comment
well i think anything that refers to a character and ingame activities is ingame anything that refers to a player and out of game activities is out of game with ingame stuff we can have the cold hard eve online with propaganda psychological warfare and all that cold brutal stuff with out of game stuff we have to have respect for eve other as real life players this would be a significant departure from the way things are done on the something awful forums where the ruie is anything on the internet is fair game but since were here in eve online to play a spaceship game i dont see a problem with keeping the interactions to dark and edgy ic and respectful and above board ooc well i dont think it will hurt to draw the line on the benefit of doubt for respectful decent interactions on an ooc level nobody should be trying to bully anybody else ooc while playing an online game yeah and since the picture ended up there because i had to release my rl name as part of the csm process its quite relevant to the op
i cant speak for jade but i can say that we covered this topic while i was trying to get his support for my proposal at one point we seemed to agree that personal attacks deriving from rl information are currently a probably barely legal part of the in game experience even if theyre in poor taste and degrade the overall experience of the game hed like to see that kind of attack banned while i think its just in extremely poor taste and should be avoided as a potentially risky move he also has some peculiar uses of the term ic and ooc that really confuse the issue for most of who dont role play at all but really youre right  a lot of eves meta game does happen here on the forums and ccp provided some formal precedence for how far the meta game can go on the forums when equating fanfest to eveo and banning the mittani for instance the slide making fun of the suicidal person was in bounds but asking people to harass him out of game in hopes of a rl result was out of boundspeople posting rl information on 3rd party sites is far more questionable and imo should be strongly avoided given how effective the mittani was at leaning on 3rd party news sites i would be in favor of in game bans for people found doing such thingslianged expounding of course
supportedmembers of the community willing to act as community advocates to ccp do not deserve to be harassed at work by their ingame enemies this happened to darius johnson jade constantine and plenty others its time for that to end
way to cherry pick the arguments you reply to at least you implicitly agreed that it would be impossible to guarantee a candidates anonymitynow onto the argument you did reply to it doesnt suit your proposal but for most part the line between game in rl is a blurry one and unless you see it from a rping perspective the csm are rl player representatives not of ingame characters in fact apart from their interest focus very little of the csm is not rlalso tell me more about your paranoia about people that would prefer representatives to drop anonymity do you think it doesnt add accountability or do you not want that the latter is only of concern for people that intend to  people off in which case you shouldnt be in the csm or do you disagree with that as well
lolkudos to the mittani for remaining a true internet spaceship spy guy he has the balls and resoursefulness to turn even his curent shtty situation to the advantage of goons in the future1 get your real life adress which is easy to find anyway posted anonymously2 get one of your henchmen to threaten raping your wife on eve radio3 get another one of your henchmen liang the op to spin this into a crybaby story that victimizes mittens himself4 turn it into a whoring campaign against ccp to anonymize csm memberships  ie make csm accessible to hordes of aspie sociopaths from goonswarm5 6 profit1
id be really interested to see your thoughts on stage 5 in our experience the csm is a hell of a lot better when its got competent social sane people on it just compare the success of csm 6 led by comrade chairman mittens to any of the other ones
tell me more about accountability and anonymity npc alt
as i told jade last night if id had any clue about the rl harassment he went through id have included his story as evidence of how deranged our player base can be in the op rl harassment over a video game is simply not acceptable  regardless of if its someone harassing the mittani jade constantine or youand frankly if you want to discount what happened to the mittani jade constantines story is enough for me to have made this proposalliang
why so bitter
its also impossible to guarantee my own anonymity that doesnt mean i go broadcasting my name face and address every time i make a post on eveoi dont see it from an rp perspective but i also have the capability of understanding that we dont elect the players behind the characters we vote for the players because of their in game accomplishments combined with a bit of freely given out of game context for why they would make a good csm candidate arguing that having their real life information lets you get to know them is total hogwash and is frankly a little bit creepy almost any way that you go about using the information could easily be classified as rl harassmentas to your argument about accountability i contend that the csm members are not personally and out of game accountable to us as players they are accountable to us to do the job which we elect them for and if they go about being disruptive or not doing that job it should be obvious from already established methods including csm minutes and dev blogs if they screw up with ccp for example by breaking the nda then ccp will remove them and bar them from running in the futureat no point in this is it necessary for you to have their real life information to make them accountable to you and your desire to have that personal guarantee of accountability is frighteningliang
i completely agree which is why i think mittens deserves to remain in csm7i also think ccp is every bit as responsible for the fck up at the alliance panel as mittens the panel was moderated by a ccp employee who made no comment when mittens was reading from his side about the wis and did nothing to reprimand mittens when he urged his minions to help the wis become an heromy conclusion ccp messed up but unlike mittens who at least had the decency basic pr awareness to take responsibility and apologize ccp is trying to get away with scapegoating mittens and make him the only one who has to pay i still cant see how making csm candidates disclose their names gets in the way of bringing more competent sane and social individuals in your own words prove my point csm6 had no anonymous members and still did a great job
if the intent is to curb rl harassment and if youd be righteous about it then youd also be calling for reprimands against the harassor since it is impossible to guarantee the candidates anonymity setting a clear policy about this is the way to go ccp seems to be awakening to this responsibility tho im sure their gonna be lazy about it read only do stuff when there is external scrutiny the asymmetry between the anonymity of the harassor and the exposed victim makes this technically challenging but not impossible in jades case you should easily be able to apply one of the new cyberbullying laws get the wheels turning and deliver the perpetrators details to the local authoritiesi dont approve of it but the fact that mittens is getting what his minions usually deal to others is epic irony
you wouldnt be a rougeoperator sock puppet would you similar incoherence anywayexactly how would anonymizing the csm throw it open to hordes of anyone the only people you could exclude by knowing their irl names is people whose name you already know the only real danger would be alts of current or past csm members and candidates plus the few players that have already disclosed their name
it makes no difference to the fact you are spinning rl harassment stories to garner support for some other agenda one that has nil to do with stopping rl harassments in evemittens has been known as alex gianturco ever since he started his tenure at csm6 during that time goonswarm staged hulkageddons invaded space burned spaceships and made lots of people pubbies shed tears of blissful rageand all this time it occured to no one to figure out mr gianturcos place of residence and threaten to force coitus on his spouse but now now he has done it boy are they pissed when he told everyone to make the wuss off himself those vile rapists just couldnt help it anymore they had to do something about itsorry nope not buying you can back off now and make this about jade constanine or whoever but the fact you spun this story after the farce on eve radio involing mittens wife has done your case poor service it only reminded everyone that anonymity is most often not a shield against rl harassments but rather a cover to people who are most likely to conduct such harassmentsback to your proposal  im sorry it makes no sense its evil its stupid and it must die luckily ccp will throw it out of the window regardless of how much support it getscsm members are public figures who willingly chose to make their involvement with the game go past their in game character into the real world this entails some commitment part of which is deanonymization
im not going to bother responding back to you because its obvious that you are a deranged individual it should be patently obvious that i am against rl harassment regardless of who is being harassed and i have a long standing aversion to rl information being given out i am truly frightened that you seem to have such a desperate need to know peoples irl informationliang
anonymizing the csm will make it open to hordes of people who would otherwise not have run because meh i have to tell everybody my name and stuffusually those who make a great deal of their privacy and anonymity online do so not out of fear of being harassed it surely isnt about their wives being harassed you figure out why so to begin with this campaign for anonymizing csm is hypocritical and wrong in the way it spins rl harassment stories as justificationif youre going to campaign for csm anonymity at least do it honestly say that you want csm to be open for anons for people who like to speak their minds freely online not having to be polite considerate or even humanly decent those who like to vomit all over with all those pesky values and tedious social norms theyve been stuffed with since prepuberty those who enjoy to express their true feelings about helping a blind old lady cross the street  hell pushing her under the bus for teh lulz is the real thing btw if theres anything i respect mittens for its his willingness to forfeit his anonymity and run about in this game with his real identity known to everyone he doesnt mind the accountability that comes with this outing this is the only thing that indicates a genuine real life personality behind the in game character this is why his apology as alex does have merit even though i still adamantly believe he only posted it as damage control vs ccp
well since two step was second after mittani why not make him the chairman since the votes show him to be favored over the other candidates
im confused did the leap year throw you off you missed april 1 by a wide marginlets face it the goons would oppose any idea resembling this had their glorious leader not been the one to fall on his face do yourselves a favor and quit giving everyone so much to gloat about shut up have your little burn jita party and carry onadapt or die goons
it isnt democratic at all might be simpler and  no effort  to ccp but isnt democratic as it dosent try to maintain the representability of the interests of the votersin democracies should a president step out his vice would come in should the vice die some other representative like a president of the senate of something would step forward not the underdogtheres no sense in the next less voted candidate stepping inand see i am not advocating that someone should replace mittens or a revote this sugestion is in regard to the future ellections and for the betterment of the processis this hategroup so blind by hate that they cant have a civil discussion without bringing the torches and the forks geethough i get the eggs in a basket popular simpleminded analogy it has no bearing in a democratic process its like saying let democratsrepublicans run with 4 candidates makes no sense
in the current state of affairs that seems logical any word on it
not in the face
while people are talking about super capital ships many have completely forgotten that regular dreadnoughts and carriers exist regular capital ships are used less and less due to the issue of their reliance of active tanking and that their roles can easily be performed by other ships lets start off with carriers carriers logistics role has been relegated to supercarriers and logistic ships the reasons being thatcarrier will almost always die to a single dd from a titan making it dead on arrival in a supercapital fight 34 logistics can the do job of one carrier while being cheaper and generally more survivable than the carrier supercarrier can do the remote rep job of a nontriage carrier while maintaining supertank and anti battleship and capital abilities with their fighter bomberstriage allows the carrier to maintain high tank and rr but at the cost of being unable to receive rr and vulnerable to damage and neuts for 5 minutes triage mode is fairly risky to use in current war doctrines the triage will not make a difference to a doomsday now lets look at the most obsolete class called dreadnoughts dreads are a class that have been mostly untouched since their introduction while more damage and shorter siege time helps its generally not worth using in current fleet doctrinesdreads only have one real role and that is to shoot structures and immobile capital ships this is a job that can easily be accomplished by super capital ships and subcapital ships dreads are rarely used in pos bashes due to the requirement to be in siege mode for 5 minutesdreads are inflexible and less used due to it being an expensive battering ram a handful of battleships and tier 3 battlecruisers can the same job of a dreadnought while having the capability to engage subcaps and the ability to disengage at willdreads are rely on active tanking to survive active tanking scales horribly in fleet fights if a fleet catches a dread in siege its as good as deaddd makes it trivially easy to oneshot kill a dread tldr  carriers and dreads are mostly obsolete due to their inflexibility of roles that can be accomplished by other ships at lower cost andor much less risk
rnk seems to be using triage archons pretty well
imagine if their enemy had brought in titans rather than supercarriers would the result have been the same
even if this were true i see far more use of carriers and dreads than supers what does it matter
seems you havent participated in recent big battles1 raiden uses carriers as logistics what you forget is that 4 scimitars need 4 people  which is a scarce resource2 most poses reinforced are either through supers or dreads a mini moros fleet can reinforce a pos in one siege cyclejust because they dont appear on killboards doesnt mean we is them
yeah dreads excel at pos bashing i see them used all the time they are far better at it than any fleet of subcaps because you would need more than 100 t3 battlecruisers to match the damage output of 10 dreadsi will point out however that if the doomsday got redesigned it may fix a lot of the problems that you have just brought up
ship balance due this year
gate guns are a joke at best anyone with a t1 battlecruiser and up or a t2 cruiser and up can easily tank gate guns without ever breaking a sweatto the opthe numerous problems with lowsec are well documented and have been brought to ccps attention countless times they currently do not have an answer to the problem all youre really doing is beating the same dead horsesummary of eves last four expansions

ah but you see this is not a democracy this is a game ccp could end the csm in a heart beat where would your dream of this is a democracy be then wake up ccp is here to make money to make it with pride and honour yes to be leaders in the industry they represent yes but here at the end of the day to make moneydemocracy is born from revolution not from a corporate decision ps anyhow just an idea like or dislike it its all good
cannot afford multiple accounts you mean people who have more irl cash so can pay for more accountsyoure thinking in the wrong direction and assuming everyone pays for their accounts with rl cashthe truth in the matter is actually that most efficient players actually dont pay for their accounts with rl cash they make enough isk in game to pay for the accounts with plex which they buy off the ingame market for isk which in return was seeded by folks that prefer to pay some extra cash not to have to grindtradepvescam for iskif you really want to try to limit the amount of votes someone has in eve to the amount of actual players i think youve got a tremendous problemalso anyone can make isk to pay for their accounts ingame be it though trademiningpvescamming so people who cannot afford multiple accounts is not really a valid issue i guess time to play the game and not being bright enough to play the game is a limiting factor but strangely i still feel that eve is already a game for the brighter soles than some of its competitors so i dont think thats really an issueany game i know allows votes per account why would eve be different do you really think everyone in goons has 100 accounts if im not mistaken eve already limits the accounts that are allowed to vote had to be active for about 6months prior to the csm voting if you think people are just making bogus accounts to generate an extra vote i can tell you youre wrongsomeone once said i was a muppet if thats so im quite sure the swedish chef is my brother
yes as i stated it elsewhere
purchasing multiple accounts for the purpose of vote padding seems a bit far fetched however alliance ceos strongly urging members to vote for them is far more likelybut thats the way it goes in eve you will never see fair democratic election in eve in the same way you will never see a fair democratic election in somalia summary of eves last four expansions
i support greater fidelity in the representation of inertia
all that really needs to happen imo is flag a smuggler as suspect crimewatch 20 when they jump through a gate with contraband let players handle the rest theres enough eager trigger fingers in eve to handle it blockade runers are somewhat immune but i am going to guess suspects cant cloak based on the feeling given from the crimewatch talk at fanfest but i have no solid refrence for that just a huntchmagnates probes kessies and which ever gal frig has the fat cargo hold will be the most likely used i suspectnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt
i like the designs with player policing becoming more relevant but i have a feeling it isnt a solution to cover all bases or completely replace existing npc systems is my only concern as such for myself i want to reserve judgement on the new crimewatch mechanics after the implementation but i do understand the relevance of what your saying and the added options for playability would be a welcome addition also
yes it needs more but that would be the core of it i doubt it will be part of the first rll out of crimewatch 20 anywaynecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt

hi everyoneis it possible to get a better feel and look on how big ships in eve are when docked in a station and while being in captains quarters mode very often i dont feel the proportions in relation to the piloti give you following examplewhen looking at the ishtar compared with the hulk my first impression is that the ishtar is bigger than the hulk but in reality as eve is real the hulk has a 509m long axis while the ishtar has a 218m long axis
initially all ships were at correct proportions  that was changed so people with frigate could actually see their frigates in hangarand now you want to change it back
now that ship spinning is back yea it should be changed back to give the sense of scale
i agree the ship sizes are a bit off however is this something that really has much of an impact i can see it being way down the list in the thingstogettoeventually column but i think that there are much more important issues at hand at the moment
eve is real

pos modules taking forever to online were also by design initially just because it was introduced in a gimped form doesnt mean that it has to stay that way
you forgot to finish the math problemthe market crashes after prices go upbecause there is no demand at that pointin other wordsin economic terms your utterly wrongbut everyone knows thatnot supportedi may not like itbut the reasoning is valid as to how it works nowid rather support ships that are equiped to tarnsport ships more easilywithout breaking the game stop the evemail spam
pos modules were changed to their current state because the long anchoronline process didnt really do anything but make it a headache for people to set up poses now that pos anchor times no longer have any real impact beyond being a headache there is no need for them to take a long time to set up however in the past pos timings used to matter more because they were how sov was controlled and how long it took to set up a pos in a hostile system had an impact in sov warfarehowever your proposal would have a significant impact on market dynamics and ship fitting turning rigs from a unique type of ship modification that you have to put some thought into and live with into just another module slot on your shipsee how different the two situations are
add to thatthe pos timers didnt adversely damage the market eithergranted they changed the fuel processbut that was for the better imhoand if anything made the market healthier stop the evemail spam
the pos example was the first to come to mind and i agree that sovereignty changes softened the necessity for those timers though i still dont consider my rig change proposal to be as significant as people sayin its current form i dont think many rigs are destroyed aside from the ship actually blowing up and i really dont think the market will change much from it the exorbitant examples given in previous posts do not seem plausible as rig manufacturing costs remain the samesure prices will inflate somewhat due to slightly lesser rig wasting on the consumer end less demand less production and thus less market competition i dont even think there will be much delay between making the change and the market stabilising afterwardsi propose to make them the same as modules because currently they are stored in the game as such act as such and for that reason are easy to fix as suchperhaps im completely missing something but i dont see these doom scenarios people are talking about already look at your ship fittings and how often you switch these up i dont know about you guys but once fitted i hardly ever change even a single module throughout its lifespanheck if what youre saying is true and people do destroy rigs so often indicating a need to change things up wouldnt we see an increase in demand as to have spare fitting sets for a given shipthere is one argument that i can understand and that is power projection i find this hard to predict and i can theorycraft a long way both ways in one bigger alliance capable of throwing isk around can already run capital transport trains and already do so in the other this would enable smaller alliances to do the same and make pvp more accessible to all
thoguh really three or four battlecruisers per carrierfreighter is very very low freight capability dont you think
no salvage prices for many rigs are already dirt cheap
not supportedlogistics and power projection are far to easy these days already an alliance can deploy in an extremely short time at extraordinary distances as it is plus if your deploying to attack a target you should be at risk from guerrilla and harassing tactics rather than have a nice easy ride into enemy territory
it can be argued that everything ccp has done to make logistics easier in this game has had the effect of making the game worse
two or three years ago there was a dev post saying that they were looking at making it easier to move rigged ships is this still in the backlog or was it quietly dropped
flexible elastic eve pshawthat might lead to fun we cant have any of that fun crap in eve
totally suportedi would also wish for a shorter timer but i supose that 23 hours is fine enougheveryother place i saw a daily timer it usually defaults to 23 hours24 hours makes no sense because you know life
thats okay buddy really theres no need to feel bad as it can happen to everyoneheres a tldr version in easy english liang says bring anonymity to csm so csm candidates dont have to disclose their rl info which may get them harassed irl by other players of eve i think that liang really wants to bring anonymity to csm just so he1 or his friends could run to csm without having to disclose their real names 1 i dont know or care about him enough to actually find out if he has his real name disclosed anywhere either way i postulate that stopping real life harassment has nothing to do with the true agenda behind his proposali never suggested that aspies cant run for csm or do a great job on board i actually think that aspies and antisocial jerks make tremendous alliance leaders and awesome csm reps i probably wouldnt vote for an aspie who gets off on blowing hulks in hisec but i also accept the reality of these people being fundamental to the success and prosperity of eve and they deserve representation in csm in proportion to their numbers and influencei just think that if a goon aspie wants to run for csm having them disclose their real life names is a fair and appropriate bar it ensures that only those motivated enough to forfeit their anonymity will make it throughregarding possible harassment irl  quite honestly i already illustrated exactly why this is nonsense if mr gianturco could roam new eden for over a year as one of the most infamous and reviled characters in the game and yet have his rl details exposed i think everyone can do that and if someone does make real life threats i think any sensible person would agree that the only solution is to deanonymize and prosecute the offender not trying to anonymize future potential victims as i explained above just because youre an aspie doesnt mean you cant run for csm you just need to muster the courage and tell everybody your real name
i am not really sure on this one how far does this goif csm meet in iceland are they supposed to only talk to other in person using their ingame name would it be a violation of the eula if someone accidently refered to someone else by their real namecan the csm member insist that they never be shown on camera or have their voice heard this is pretty bad pr for the game if people on the csm have to basically act like they are in some sort of witness protection program isnt itthat said it is pretty clear that allot of people take this game too seriously mittani once mentioned in a podcast how some eve playing lawyer kept getting harrassed in real life by goons sending faxes to his office or something like that make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
just so i can be clear on the argument people have against this proposalnobody knows that liang nuren  the mittaniliang nuren runs for csmbecause the rl names of the candidates are not revealed liang is elected to the csmmittens can go back to ruining evedid i summerize it correctlyseems to me that unless ccp has some issues with rl names not being released to the playerbase wierd laws or something it should have been in place years agomaybe i misunderstood the complaint though
i support this initiative real names and passports to ccp eve char names for the rest of us
how was mittens ruining eve specifically also i suspect that if goonswarm wants to get people on the csm in any given term they will
yep sounds reasonable it might make sense to require csm members to reveal any public figure alts though at least require that if you have been in the csm before you run under the same character name again it would be weird if we could not use information on past performance in the csm while making voting decisions obviously real identities will be revealed when people meet each other for rl be it for csm or for fanfest or just local meets but eulatos already forbids you from posting that information to the forums ingame etc
empty quoting for great honor
what do you mean forums ingame etc are we able to post it on failheap challenge what about other mediums that have nothing to do with eve when massively reports the names of the csm members because the csm showed up at a public event like fanfest will all employees of massively have their eve accounts banned if people make their identity public by showing up in person with others it is sort of hard to unring the bell is ccp supposed to police the internet for any mention of somones name and then try to track down who released it and then see if they have an eve account and why are they doing this again because someone somewhere said something stupid to the guy who was telling people who said they were considering ending their lives to go ahead and kill themselves make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i did not expect this particular proposal to bring the tinfoil out of the cupboards like this when i originally saw it wow guys just wow thats some petty stuff right thereanother 1 because it deserves it
signedthe people that are against this are literally trying to say that rl identities hold someone more accountable because of the implication of rl reprisals holy  you mentally unstable sociopaths need to get a life
you act like the csm is taken seriously by most of the playerbase anyways its not theres no reason to publish names of the real people
if rl identities dont amount to any additional accountability and are in fact meaningless to your conduct in the world of new eden why do you support changing the current situation and anonymizing csm whats there to gainobvious projection is obvious
considering that you personally said well if csm members screw up they get to deal with the consequences harassment lol htfu o7o7o7 irl i think we can safely assume that this proposal is completely reasonable lobby our csm delegates about it and hopefully see it in place for csm 8thanks for your support
in what way do rl names add any sort of accountability that doesnt involve some level of rl harassmentthe only way they add to accountability is by the hanging threat of defamation or rl threats thats just not tolerable
i dont know about you but i knew about this for several months why not you stop the evemail spam
given the fact a person can do level 4 missions a couple of hours per day and dedicate a couple of days and pay for the fuel for a small pos i wonder if it would be a good idea to make pos more available to corps  right now you need a ridiculous amount of standings corp wise standing not single person to make it more available in low and high secright now pos anchoring works with the average standings on the corp with the faction you want to anchor your pos in for a single person this can be fixed in a couple of months or so for a whole corp well it works on average so play with the numbers in other words its nearly impossible because everyone has to work with their standings only missions offer standings afaiki dont know how exactly how the mechanics should work but i think if a small corp or relatively small corp can easily take care of a small pos then i think its normal if its available in high sec besides manufacture research bpo copying and all those slots are taking so making it available in a pos for a corp would be a good thing if you ask mei cant think of a bad side to this idea besides the fact that empire space might have way more pos in moons but i dont consider that a bad thing
because you have 2 consecutive zs in your name everyone with 2 consecutive zs in their name should pay extra isk in fact anyone whose name doesnt start with psi and end with tic should pay extra seriously this sounds like a great solution to a nonexistent problem

ccp was talking about a module that would jam targets if lots locked onto you or something this could potentially fix dreads and carriers because there would be no primary getting hit by 90 of the enemy fleet
zircon the numbers he posted werent flown it was sit in in other words if you sit in your rifter and your dread is in your hangar it wont countand most dreads are secondary ships you dont hang out in
copy pasta soif you have an issue with the way he words things perhaps you should take it up with him
so the pair of dreads we used in this fight with snuff the other week or the blap dread we used in this fight vs unwilling 3 days ago are obsoleteoh hey look ma its another moron who has no  clue what hes talking about that squidgy grey thing between your ears is supposed to do more than stop the wind blowing through your head you know
the problem with dreads is if you put a fleet of them out on a structure shoot 50 titans will get dropped on them however they get used a fleets of 200 are being used to burn tenal the price has also rocketed
yes i am bitching again in real life i have a job that i work every weekend i get every monday tuesday off however there is no current way to see what days an alliance or corp is most active on  well not easy lets say  why cant that be add to the recruitment search function on eve hence active on saturday sunday monday tuesday ect ect granted it can be abused but atleast it is a helpful tool that can be niche alliances and corps could use to recruit i am not antisocial but it is depressing when you hear of all these great friday night actions and when you log on el ziltcho i cannot be the only pilot on the eve universe who faces this problem  oh fyi when the boss comes in on monday in a bad mood hungover and bitchy i am long gone by the time wednesday rolls around people are feeling much better and there are no bosses on the weekend so there

wormholes being relatively new to eve about a year i have seen many glorious things in eve and am highly addicted one thing that seems to boggle my mind is why we can not loot or take pos  equipment  or items that have laid dormant in a wormhole or area seems logical i tend to live by the thought of fail to fuel your pos and live with the consequences dear fellow eve addict to many systems i have been in have dormant desolate wastes of items that could be sold for some serious isk  or possibly of some use to the explorer why not give the bounty to the pirate or the explorer to add to his tales of wonder i was there live it embrace it love it my friendsmini eve program  skill manipulation only so as to not make another thread for the second idea but what about a small or mini eve program that runs on any computer where you can log in and at least set up your skills before they run out most people do travel or have crappy laptops that the new captains quarters pretty much nuked into a word processor only paperweight having a mini program would allow anyone anywhere to adjust their training just an idea to boost the eve fun and its addictability shrug respectfullygervmeister neub wormhole explorer
i have thought this too i have a netbook that will not run the eve clientrather than a mini program how about making it web based thus enabling updating of skills queue from anywhere without having to maintain seperate windows and mac mini clientsother advantages of web are no need for client side updates
coming to evegate soontm possibly
this ties into the whole pos mechanics are terrible issue and has been beaten more often than a red headed step childthe whole pos mechanics system is in desperate need of an overhaul summary of eves last four expansions
i discovered an abandoned pos worth over 3 billion isk last night there was nothing i could do about it i ended up just leaving it alone and moving onit should say that pos is protected by the magic anchoring spell because i see absolutely no mechanic that makes sense that you cant remove a powerless posexcept magic
i like all those myself dunno what anyone else thinks like to hear though as ive been thinking more about this the los in asteroid belts is the only smallscale example i could think of that everyone could understand addition of the tesselation and physx looks like a candidate to create a situation where for instance a miner could actually get away from attacking pirates by hiding behind a large roid which blockee their los and therefore their scramblers etc for just a few seconds as they moved in to a better position to get a clear shot at the miner just ramp that same scenarios principles up to any scale in any situation and there we have it the most fantastic game on planet earth with real strategy and tactics not just a bunch of wannabes shooting thru a kilometer of rock with their magic guns  which to me is pretty low scale but thats my personal opine

this is needed bring it to realityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 im all for this this would be fun to play with
this could break the entire game the sky could fall right on top of our heads whats more it is impossible  like everything elseso what i want 1 for more fun
it is rather slow going but this thread is getting the love as each day goes by i figure if they can take the time to make sleeve tattoos then they can probably do the same for some additional ambulation seriouslyone of these days they will come out and saywe set jiggle from 0 to 1 and now breasts have ambulation
get out of your drake and you will notice that the game requires a bit more effort than simply pressing f1
thiswe need more pos shooting in eve amirite
i like it 1this solves the problem in the simplest way possible occum would be proud
thread number 30007 on fixing the alt loopholenow if only people would make a thread about making bounty hunting work as a profession
this one is wellthought out imho
it is just another way to fix the alt loophole if you think the alt loophole is what keeps bounty hunting from being a profession then you probably have never tried doing it as your professionmalcanis has a post from a few months ago up also look at some of the old and i mean archived threads some of them had good ideas
have 200 mill shipput 30 mill bounty on pilotgank in altrepeat
if they proposed it did they say when it could be expected
ok how about some constructive criticism
one reason why frigs are not used in fleet fights is cause of small drones who powned themi propose to remove bs ability to use small drones so to limit them to med and large dronesno limitation for t2 bs marauder need all drones and black op actually dont really need to be nerfedthat will encourage variety in fleets and will allow low skills players and frigs specialist to join the fightbest regardspanto
so you want to make it so that bses have issues running lvl 4 missions i dont think thats a good idea at allsuggesting changes that break a large use of a ship to solve a small issue is stupid besides frigs are already used as fast tackle for fights yes theyll likely die but theres nothing stopping low sp pilots from getting into fights like that and having fun with a cheap throwaway ship
you still can easily kill lvl 4 frig rats with medium drones also u can fit a web in order to help not a real issue for me missions rat are way more easy to kill than players
this is complete and utter bullnot supportingyou obviously have no idea what fleet fights are all aboutfrigs are frequently used as tackledrones are a hazard no matter what ship your flyingyour proposal would break several mechanics very easilyplease dont bother coming up with ideas you dont know anything about stop the evemail spam
2bss need light drones to deal with pve and small scale pvp yes pvp exists outside of massive fleetsmediums will have problems against fast frig pvp even with a webthe poor rokh would be completely boned
more agressive pls
im sorryi didnt mean to hurt your feelingsif you feel so offended please go to hello kitty onlineyoull find its much nicer over therein the mean timestop breaking up the pvp world with your carebear ideasthankshave a nice day and welcome to eve onlineid expect everyone else to fry my little rump with an idea like thatdont expect any mercy from me stop the evemail spam
asking for a nerf to bs to address a problem that you have with light drones is rather hamfisted like ccp so watch this spacebetter solution one that leaves pve as is and solves your problem is to decrease their activationorbit range or decrease their orbiting speeds  either one will make lights mwd burn a lot more thus making popping them for a frig that much easier
 drake draconiscannot play hello kitty for moment ur dad using my accountand dont cry for ur pvp i understand u are scared to see ur bs burning cause of frigs but ask santa for a new onewith your carebear ideas  seriously  ravenesa true 
sorry but you have no idea what you are talking about
classic carebear come backplease pubbiekeep crying your tearsyou should learn to play the game instead of breaking itout here in 00 space we use frigates friequentlytypically interceptorsassault frigatesand even the classic rifter ftwwe employ battleships frequently as welland drones to deal with various situationsin fact our fleets are a mixture of various classes and wide varieties of shipsdrones to deal with fun things like conqureing spaceive also been around enough small time fleet fights to know that no fleet worth its salt wouldnt be without a firgate to do some sort of scouting or tacklingif you cant tackledont expect to get your preyi know for a fact you have no idea and likely live in high sec space chewing on level 4sso pleasego away and do some researchdont bother coming back until you know what your talking about stop the evemail spam
if your frig is agressed by a blob of drones burn away let your friends do the damage
 this op is a clueless newbie
not supported the odds of a frigate surviving a large battle are quite high if one knows what they are doing and remain situationally awareone time i personally lead a whole blob of drones away from an engagement in a crusader and by the time the enemy realized what was happening because they we preoccupied with my friends the drones and i were more than 100km away from everyone most of the enemy opted to abandon their drones and throw out a spare flight provided they had onenow did i miss out on some killmails yes did i point anyone no did i contribute to my fleet in some way hell yes i led a bunch of dps off field and am im still using some of the drones i picked up that day
not supportedlogical thinking alone stands between me and supporting this absurd idea
op has never been in a fleet fight and thus should not try and post ideas regarding themi have never been in a fleet fight that did not involve frigates
i haveit sucksfrigates are a requirement imhoawfully hard to get anywhere without that small nimble ship of various abilties stop the evemail spam

this information may be easy to get a hold of but it shouldnt be any easier because of ccp supported
stick it into the nda boom problem solved in a manner with legal recoursesupported
i see goonthugs everywhere but with that aside i support this proposal
i am going to presume that you are talking about ankhesentapemkah here if not then i apologise in advanceankhesentapemkah  eva jobse was banned for a breach of the nondisclosure agreement nda ccp confirmed this a number of timesif you do a google search of ankhesentapemkah you will find a lot about her personal life very quicklythis was information that she put out there of her own accord she was not shy about being a member of the csm and if anything publicly promoted this fact as much as she couldafter her ban she stated that she did not agree with decision and would reveal why on her blog she never didconsidering evas background she should of known better then most that when you break a nda it is only ever going to end in a butt hurt load of painthe only thing i will give her is she never complained that the decision taken by ccp could have real life consequencesin truth she couldnt as it was her decision promote herself at every opportunity that she held this role from her own personal website to her personal blogthe same should be said of kittenswhilst i do not agree with everything that has happened and been said it has been alexs decision to promote the link between his real life and the character the mittani he has never been shy about the fact from various articles he has written for various sites comments made on various forums etc he has actively promoted himself to the same if not greater degree as eva didby doing this he has to accept that there is going to be consequences mainly being that you leave yourself open to idiots making personal attack against you external to eve outside of ccps controlyou can not openly court the media and then complain if people attack youeverybody who runs for the csm is aware that your real name will be made public if you accept this then you also have to accept that any actions you take as part of the csm can be and most likely be linked to your real namethe issue is magnified some what due to the character of the mittani and the goons any fool would realise that being in this position greatly increases the chance that at some point some idiot will make personal attacks against you throw on top the sheer amount of self publicity he gives himself i am only surprised this did not happen sooneragain i do not agree with everything that has happened and been said but alex is an intelligent adult who was well aware of the possible consequences of the decisions he has made
everyone who watches fanfest needs to sign an ndashould the csm appear with masks on to protect their identitiesmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
cearain youre trying to make this proposal into something its not are you really so dense that you cant understand itliang
i have seen many pictures come out from fanfest of popular players in their natural form i still have no idea who they are where they are from etcyoure grasping at straws
they shouldnt is the answerhowever in regards to both kittens and ankhesentapemkah i knew there real names long before they become members of the csm due to their own self promotionneither have what you would call being shy telling the world about themselvesdoes that give people the right to say the kind of things that were directed at kittens of course it doesnt but if they are willing to tell the world about themselves then you have to expect at some point some idiot is going to say things that are reprehensiblethe risk is greatly magnified when you promote yourself like kittens has done over the yearsonce again i want to stress that i do not agree with any of personal attacks that have been aimed at alex but you have to accept there are consequences and risks with this kind of self promotionalex is supposed to be a successfully lawyer in real life therefore a very well educated person am i to believe that he was not aware that his actions his self promotion would risk something like this happeningalso other then alex and eva who else on the csm have openly self promoted themselves outside of evedo you not find it funny that the only 2 csm members that have had issues outside of the game because of the game have both been very vocal very self promoting always courting the media outside of evei personally believe that in both cases being on the csm had very little to with anything as i said before their real life names were already known on the internet because they chose to tell the world not because they were on the csm
if you read the thread jade constantine has some pretty serious issues spring up without being so vocal and self promoting furthermore the constant accusation leveled at darius iii of breaching the nda could potentially have rl implications larkonis trassler also could be looking at similar problemsliang
i was totally unaware what happened to jade and again i find it a totally reprehensible act yet i also find it funny how many members of goonswarm were on the forums saying what was said about alex to be terrible yet them themselves are just as bad double standards here i thinkas for darius again the goons have a major hand in this even thou ccp have stated clearly a number of times that darius has not broke the nda they continue to accuse himas for larkonis trassler before this post i had never heard of him did a quick google search and found he was kicked off the csm for using insider information to make isk none of the articles i found including ccps official statement mentioned anything regarding ndai am not saying the goons are at fault but its seems with the examples you have given that 2 out of 3 go back to the goonsperhaps because of the past actions of members of the goons this is why he was attacked in the manner he wasagain i am not condoning it two wrongs do not make a right  however you can not be surprised when people treat you then same way you treat themif ccp do decided to no longer release the real life names of the csm members fine by melets be honest here it makes no difference whether we know their rl names or not personally i would notwhat i would like to add is i do not know if alex was a member of the goons or was personally involved or was in charge at the time those personal attacks were made on jade but if he was then i would sincerely hope he now has a better understanding of what it is like being personally attacked and maybe just maybe he makes sure that whilst he is leading the goons he does his best to make sure it doesnt happen again to anybody else
but their identities will be shared and can be published  and ccp can do nothing about it the idea of trying to keep the identities of people who are going to show up in person at live events secret is pretty odd i mean if they cancel the fanfest csm meeting this might make some sense but even there are ccp devs supposed to always call the men who play seleen and elise seleen and elise or miss randolf when they are in a meeting or at a pub are they going to make up nameswhether you know who they are is irrelevant if the concern is some crazy wants to find mittani or his wife they easilly can the purpose of the idea is not to prevent people who really dont care about who is on the csm from finding out their names the idea is to prevent someone who is nutty enough to care allot from getting this information that wont work ok so it probably wont work but are there are there any disadvantagesnot really just a few very minor ones as far as i can tell1csm is not an in game council they are real people who are discussing possible changes to a game electing an ingame character to represent you in the real world sort of blurs this distinction mittani suggested he couldnt keep it straight who he was at the alliance meeting i dont believe him but he did claimand i suppose some believed he couldnt keep it straight what hat he was wearing this would only worsen that blurring problem2 similar to the first problem we often hear csm members claim they are qualified for the csm due to their real life jobs how can these claims be verified is it all just in game bullshit mittani claimed his experience as a lawyer would help him and some people believed him how are voters supposed to verify this is it going to become like spying in eve were people can lie all they want and its just part of the game 3are we admitting that this game has so many truly evil people that unlike every other gamehobbysport our csm members need to be treated as though they are in a witness protection program4 its still unclear what the rules would require if someone calls someone by their real name at fanfest and someone else overhears it should they be reprimanded  assuming they have an account seems like a bunch of silly drama over nothing to me but really i dont even really understand the rules now for example i dont know what eula mittani violated he gave the ingame name of someone  was that the violation or was it because he encouraged people to go after him in game  isnt that what merc corps do i really dont know what specific term of the eula he violated but whatever i dont really care make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i dont know about jade but as far as the nda if real life people are violating real life contracts it can have real life consequences why is this bad this is good right i mean that gives extra protection that csm will play by the rules if the only thing that happened was some sort of in game thing then csm would be more likely abuse the information they receive rightmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
if its so easy to understand what you are proposing why not answer the questions i posemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
signed some yadda yadda reiterated reason as to why i support this when others have clearly done so andor better than i couldve said so myself
that appears to have happened early 2008 darius johnson ccp sreegs gave the 2009 goonswarm fanfest presentation as the ceo of goonswarm at the time the mittani was the goonswarm spymaster but im not sure how much of a hand he had in any of thatnotably i contacted the mittani to see if i could arrange to have that page taken down and it turns out that goons dont actually own that site but it is a rip of their internal wiki from earlymid 2008 i also sent an email to the addresses on record from whois but they appear to be mum so far the wiki rip as a whole is kinda useless at this late date as even game mechanics have widely changed theres several other really bad crossovers to rl trolling from that time too also documented on the wiki aside from darius iii id say that i havent seen that sort of campaign from goons in a long timei didnt say that lark broke the nda  i said he was removed for misconduct which is linked to his real life name which could have similar rl implicationsid say that the game appears to have matured quite a bit since most of the major meta gaming scandals  and no matter what we as an eve community have proven ourselves to be just as goonish as the old goons if not worse again we have shown that we simply cannot be trusted with this kind of rl informationliang
line your questions out in one single post in a concise formatliang
what do you mean forums ingame etc are we able to post it on failheap challenge what about other mediums that have nothing to do with eve when massively reports the names of the csm members because the csm showed up at a public event like fanfest will all employees of massively have their eve accounts banned if people make their identity public by showing up in person with others it is sort of hard to unring the bell is ccp supposed to police the internet for any mention of somones name and then try to track down who released it and then see if they have an eve account and why are they doing this againis it because someone somewhere said something stupid to the guy who was telling people who said they were considering ending their lives to go ahead and kill themselvesmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i dont know about jade but as far as the nda if real life people are violating real life contracts it can have real life consequences why is this bad this seems good i mean that gives extra protection that csm will play by the rules if the only thing that happened was some sort of in game thing then csm would be more likely abuse the information they receive rightmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
you are confused im not complaining about consequences for breaking real life contracts im talking about how the csm candidates and members having real life information available implicitly makes accusations of breaking the nda a matter of rl importance im talking about rl defamation character assassination and harassment derived from the rl information thats just given out for no reason at allliang
i gave the questions in a clear format feel free to number them if that makes it easier for you but most of the questions came in a context so i will not take them out of the context or try to recreate the context for you sorrymake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
it should be a matter of real life importance its a real life nda and real life accusations of its breach by real life people this is a good thing because csm is a group of real life people who sometimes run based on their real life accomplishments if ccp wrongly defames anyone for violating the nda then they would be subject to the laws of the relevant jurisdiction i agree with your first sentence i am confused what your issue with this is make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
ccps forums are covered by ccps eula and tos this is readily apparent its worth mentioning that ccp has banned people for posts on 3rd party sites that claimed eulatos violations however at this point youre basically talking about a systematic campaign of harassment and rl character assassination i honestly cant believe im having this conversation with you what in the hell makes you think its any more ok to do this about csm members than it is about you or me its worth pointing out here that media twitter and blog coverage of fanfest have almost universally referred to people by their in game names i suspect theres a lot of reasons for this but the biggest is probably because rl names are kinda meaningless to usyou seem to be attacking the proposal on the basis that this is an attempt at security through obscurity but im not sure thats a reasonable thing to do ultimately there is a lot of information thats out there but isnt easily accessible  if its accessible at all just because i showed up and had lunch with a member of veto last year doesnt mean that suddenly everyone on the internet knows his real name and where he livesthey arent and im very confused as to why you keep talking about systematic campaigns of rl character assassination defamation and harassment as if its a reasonable thing for people to be doingno theres a lot of reasons that the current proclamation of rl information isnt necessary  or wiseliang
you are confused again im not talking about ccp accusing people of breaking the nda im talking about players accusing people of it here in eve the propaganda machine plays a particularly center role in crushing your foes  and systematic campaigns of in game character assassination are absolutely expected but people go a bit far sometimes with those campaigns and can cause irreparable harm when needlessly linked to someones real nameseriously jade constantine and darius are pretty well perfect examples of why we should not be proclaiming rl information just for  and gigglesliang
i think people are missing the point of liangs proposal a tldr of it isthats it no more no less these are not any things included in the proposalccp not knowing the candidates names ccp has every interest in the rl identities of the csm for purposes of nda making sure the community is not being deceived by one guy with multiple characters etc making it eulaillegal to mention someones rl identity by all means if you want to talk about some bob smith from new york or to be on real firstname basis with your corpmates feel free rl harrassment remains illegal though csms cant tell anyone their name csms can tell their rl identities to anyone they want the proposal simply means that they do not have to tell the whole internet publicly liangs secret agenda to get onto the csm ultimately whether you trust a csm or not is hopefully based not on whether their last name is smith or adams or petrusson its based on their views and trustworthiness in game and as a player if liang or mittens or chribba decides to run for csm with a noname alt thats perfectly fine no credibility means no election success no accountability it is perfectly legal to endlessly harass the csms in game to blast them on forums and news sites and gasp even to not vote for them in the next election it is not legal to threaten them irl or to verbally or physically assault them liangs proposal makes the latter illegal behavior harder to achieve and doesnt do anything at all to hamper the former no legal accountability is removed seriously im starting to think most people can type but not read or think and that only helps solidify liangs argument that the eve community is not worth being trusted with rl details

hi guysi had a thought yesterdayi would like to see in the show info of a ship who built it and when its a simple idea but i think it would just be nicewould work really nice with supers as u could see where it came from in the first placejust a thought dark
honestlyi think this would be kinda coolits harmless to the gamekinda makes it amusing in some aspectscould inspire loyalty and pricing by key manufacturers for grinsgot my vote stop the evemail spam
nice idea older ships could actually gain value also be cool if the details displayed on the killmail
would be nice for the industrialists too knowing it was their ship that they built that killed that titan or whatever
kiling a 5 year old hulk would make me feel more fuzzy than a 1 week old one

im giving the go ahead for this enough said
would require some serious changes in a databasealso already discussed like 100 timesinsert some waste of screen space here
hhmm i wasnt aware it had already been suggestedwell i can understand how it would be a challange to apply it to ships already made as that data is most likly not stored atm so they could add it to all furture ships builtdont really think it would be a huge change to the database all it is doing is adding a extra field
i must admit that i chuckled reading welsige bemoaning the absence of a fair and civil discussion how ironicin any case the mittanis lead in votes and former position of chair was hardly in the best interests or tradition of democracythe csm uses atlarge voting one of the more regressive forms of representation electing atlarge representatives magnifies the power of minority bloc voting read goons while meeting a low bar of democracy voting it fails more rigourous tests of fairness and substantive representation it is for this reason that real world voting is geographically bounded by districts or ridingsif welsige is really concerned about improving the csm he should turn his attention to replacing atlarge voting with a more representative systemcheers
to use a quote you goons love to use htfu
originally i was going to throw this idea out however the more i thought about it and tweaked it the more i liked it then i shared it with some militia friends and they seemed to like it toactually quite a bit what parts i sharedso i revisited portions of it and fleshed out some of the details i was lackinga lot of my ideas includes changes that are interconnected so in the beginning im going to give a highlevel overview of it i will probably be posting several follow up posts fleshing out some of the details on my blogthe big pictureinstead of removing occupancy i suggest we change it  introducing tiered sovereignty mechanics that are unique to faction war each system would have 5 lvls of occupancy shared between the warring factions when one faction has lvl 2 the other will have lvl 3 etc so that the total occupancy equals 5 this also means that when you gain an occupancy lvl the opposing faction loses oneinstead of occupancy only being tied to plexing i propose we make it tied to all activity done within that system giving players many options for defending andor taking occupancy in systems missions done by agents in that system pvp and plexing would all give victory point payouts that would affect occupancyyour occupancy lvl would directly affect your lp payouts with missions plexes and pvp giving lp payouts it would be beneficial to take occupancy lvls to increase your income also it would be beneficial to defend as losing occupancy will make your income in that system decreaseonce a faction gains an occupancy lvl 4 which will be relatively difficult to do the system goes vulnerable and they can make a final push to take sovereignty of that system this would include a structuretimeretc similar to current nullsec mechanicsonly fw pilots of the sovereign faction and the sister facation will have access to the stations in each system no neutrals in addition to these individual system mechanics there would also be further overarching mechanics regarding the war as a whole the more occupancy and sovereignty you take in lowsec will directly affect your defenses in highsec there is the understanding that as you lose occupancy lvls and sov in general in the lowsec systems the faction police will be sent to the front to help defend therefore the defenses in highsec will descrease and in some cases pvp will bleed over into highsecin addition to these general changes i wouldmake it so that only lvl 13 agents are in stations lvl 4 agents would be moved into locations in space similar to concord agents in nullsec and would be difficult to complete without a small gangfix the unbalance in ewar and etc in plexes making plexes balanced across all racesrepping someone from your faction will never give you a standings decrease even if the person is a pirate neutrals repping fw pilots would get a standings hit from the opposing faction after the fixing and reblancing i would include the following new content featureslvl 5 faction war missions that require largish fleets to get throughrandomly occurring fw encounters where npc battles show up on gates and stations and fw pilots could defend friendly npcs and kill enemy npcs the staged battle would complete when all npcs of one side were defeated these encounters would range in size and scope from small frigate encounters to larger bs encountersand could possibly include a good drop of some kind if a faction officer happened to show up at the end they would also be extremely dangerous to non fw neutrals who would get shot by both parties invulnerable systems would be more prone to these encountersrandom wild cool stuff that mostly just relates to fw in the same way that dictors bubbles cyno jammers and etc are only really useful in nullseci could get pretty imaginative here but its just a rough idea an example would be a pos module that an offensive party ie the non sov holding party could put up that disrupts communications in system making it harder for the defending party to access their lvl 4 agents in space or perhaps a faction shipitem that gives you bonuses based on your faction standing or perhaps a different kind of jump bridge that can connect highsec faction bases to lowsec bases where both sovereignty and a high occupancy lvl is heldanyway just an idea i think fw needs more choiceswwwgamerchicknet gamerchick42
1 for the concept of altering fringe high sec system statusnot quite sure how much constructive critisism i can provide  im not a fw kinda guy but i do find it interesting to read about  regardless i read through your idea and it seems pretty sol
let me point out this is a preemptive measure in the long run regarding the availability of items modules and all about the market i dont need to go in the details about the market prices demands and offers but if more slots are available more items will be available on the market
i somewhat agree with the op belonging to a player corp incurs the risk of war declarations to which npc corp members are immune so it is only fair that a player corp should also have some economic benefits over an npc corp 10 tax is really not that significanthowever that could be accomplished with buffs to the player corp rather than penalties to the npc corp more carrot less stick
prior to the incursion patches a gcc frig with a good align time ie not a punisher with a 400mm plate could fly gate to gate while gcced without exploding after 12 jumps in incursion sentries were changed to always get at least a single shot on every the fastest aligning frigate this basically means that when you gcc in a buffer tanked frigate you are pretty much stuck in a system for 15 minutes assault frigates can make it a few jumps and a few specialized fits can still travel aroundallowing gcced frigates to travel around doesnt really affect anyone its not like they can stay on gate long enough to point someone and this doesnt affect any other ship class since cruisers and above can easily tank sentries while going gate to gate
im sorrybut i fail to see how this is a problemall i see here is an opportunity for more target practice stop the evemailUFFFDspam

bullshit my unplated wolf nanoed slicer and just about everything else takes at least one shot from sentries when passing through a gate or warping after undocking and yes i have evasive maneuvering v and spaceship command v
well ccp fixed thisif you are gcc you cant warpand as for jumping in highsec with gcc its impossible concord stops you from jumping or docking so regardless of the ship you are flying its going to die
get ready to be punished for your crimes
your doing it wrong i know quite a few pilots who do this sort of thing all the timeheck just post in cp and watch the trolls roll in  stop the evemailUFFFDspam

i cant see why this wouldnt work great idea
so long as it doesnt outright prevent people from interfering in a fight in some manner i have no problem with this
people can do whatever they want this is just a way to get the agression timer without the hassle of can flipping or other mechanics the safegaurds are there to prevent abuse and spamming people to fight

i came across this topic because someone in corp chat last night said that they added the ability to manage skill queues via an api key in the last patch this would mean if its true that an app like aura for android could allow for updating your skill queue out of game i cant seem to find the information via the patch notes so it may be a false rumori understand both sides of this argument but as someone who is already on notice by the feds that i will probably be getting deployed to the disaster zone out in the mid west due to tornadoes if this happens its going to be impossible to update my skills for at least two weeks as a month old player after looking over my skill queue the longest skill i have that i can train is around 8 days it would suck loosing a week worth of skill points this early in the gamei would love if they made a change that allowed for a player to set up a vacation skill queue for up to three weeks out of the year this queue could be something you turn onoff which would kick in once your regular queue ran out of skills to train while turned on it would auto populate your training queue with skills in your vacation queue up to three weeks total in a calendar year it would be something that can be turned off andon so whether you are away for a week three times or one three week stretch you would have the three weeks total at your disposalthe second addition would be an account hold for active military red cross etc this could be on a case by case basis handled directly through ccp all discussion about the usimperialromemilitaryworlddominationconquestplot aside if you are out in theory making the world a better place helping people you should be able to contact ccp and have your account put on an administrative hold with skill points banked at the very least banked game time should not be ticking away while you are gone for several months especially since a lot of times you get the notice last minute if anything by not having a policy in place for this kind of thing it makes me not want to do what i did and pay for six months in advance gaming companies should welcome people prepaying for long contracts and reward this behaviori know several other mmos that allow you to contact the company and have this done in fact while i will not be mentioning any names one of the big ones even gives level bumps based off of the amount of time you were away as long as you provide proof of deploymenti do understand that by not having to log into game to update your skill queue there are going to be people who set up toons that they just ignore for the purpose of reselling only which is taking advantage of the situation by having a three week only vacation queue and having to go through ccp directly for anything longer due to deployment this issue should not be a problem the guy who says that people have to make life choices and work should not be a factor in games who also mentioned laptops are cheep and can be used anywhere hate to break it to you pal but its not true a lot of the places i go have no power nevermind internet sometimes i am lucky if there is cell service just because you work a normal 95 job where you are always connected to the rest of the world does not mean its like that for everyonehow about thinking out of that little box you have created where the world revolves around you your apple ishit facecrap and the rest of the mediadriven garbage dumped on our society embraced by mindless idiots i did have a choice what line of work i went into and have no regrets but am really tired of people who are so self centered they cant comprehend wo people like the op doing his job your world would be reduced to hunting and gathering all day our society has gotten so spoiled its disgusting
they didnt you heard wrong but they are talking about allowing pushpull api operations once the new api harness comes out in  inferno i think if that is the case then that should be all thats done no other skill queue changes should happenoh and if you have to be out of town for a long period you can always deactivate your account which will iirc pause the time on it so that you dont lose time from being away there is a system in place to keep from wasting training time but it doesnt just hand you the sp while youre away
very cool thanks for the information if you dont mind me asking because i cant seem to find info on the pushpull will that allow for updating of the skill queue via a cell phone i would be totally ok with the skill queue being exactly as it is now if i could update it remotely even if i am somewhere wo service at least when i do get it again i can update remotely
well once droidios applications get updated to allow for skill queue management then yes but if skill queue manipulation can only be done via eve gate then you might have to manually navigate there on your phones browser so as long as its possible on the comp itll be possible on a droidiphone sooner or latter one way or the other
ok nice i have no problem using the browser as long as it can be done from a phone amazing news ty
well from what i see is dreds are rocking atm some of my most fun fights have been dred on dred fights they rock there like dig ships of the wall lol
according to wiki dreadnaughts were awesome antibattleship class ships by design our dreads hardly even touch battleships because of their design and implementation issues being focused around pos bashes with the current hullsgive us new antisub cap role focused dread hulls that will make bs pilots cry with nerd ragegive us new carrier hulls with the same sort of focus and less logistical roles and bonuses moar fighters more fighter variety more deadly awesome win
i completely disagree ccp listens to its player base if enough people want something they are pretty good about making it happen this proposal needs more attention and im sure that with enough player backing this type of feature could be implemented with or without the csms involvementsome great work here asuka your suggestions will add meaningful depth and complexity to pi and the game overall i strongly encourage the csm and ccp to consider this for implementation
to be sure id not want my breasts to get up and go places without me but surrender to the laws of physics just a bit yes
this should be ccps number one priority for avatar based gameplay
10
i like the idea the new skill is workable and the covert cargo and diplomatic pouch mods are interesting but i see no need for a new class of vessels when there are a number of existing hulls that could viably make use of these items as to a gsc that can cloak itself i think thats pushing it a bit to much
seeing as this is falling behind i think it should get bumped back up a hacking module would be awesome and would be a great way to clean up the clutter i support the idea as long as this is easy to kill and the pos had to have been offline for a set time already before being hackededit by easy i mean a good couple hours with a lone bc
hey devs make it sowhether or not you win the game matters not its if you bought it
supported as it has been on a number of similar threads over the years
1 because why the hell not
nerf trackingincrease average dps to 15000limit the amount of titans that can be ongrid
that is awesome
this totally just gave me the mental image of a trollface flying away with a whole swarm of drones struggling to catch up
not supported i think the above statement invalidates the original proposal
frigates are used alot in pvp both as a fleets of their own and in massive fleet fights
nerf battleshipsgo onmake them cry like super pilots
i didnt exactly see battleship pilots crying when supers got nerfed because their boats got owned by bombers
this wouldnt even be a hard fix weve got new killmails coming in with calculated values im not sure i agree on the whole 60 and 80 numbers id probably go for 90 and id also put in specific rules about only getting money for destroyed goods so you cant just blow up your own ship with expensive cargo at a chance for getting the bounty and subtracting insurance and salvage value from the payoutbut besides that yes this is basically what ive wanted whats been needed what i made a god damned post about in fni and what was suggested over six years ago but which still hasnt been fixedi know bounty hunting needs a really big overhaul but frankly im sick of waiting poses got a bandaid in the form of fuel blocks can we please get a bandaid in the form of a bounty hunting system that isnt blatantly exploitableif i had alts id support you on them as well
one reason against but still many more reasons for also it is only a contributing factor and a small factor at that if you want to address blobbing there are much more issues to tackle more to the point keeping jcs the way they are wont help you solve the problem nor will changing them prevent you from solving it i still support the reduction simply cutting it to 12hrs is the least convoluted way to solve the problem
petrus blackshell wrotei liangs secret agenda to get onto the csm ultimately whether you trust a csm or not is hopefully based not on whether their last name is smith or adams or petrusson its based on their views and trustworthiness in game and as a player if liang or mittens or chribba decides to run for csm with a noname alt thats perfectly fine no credibility means no election success trustworthiness in game surely you jest mittani got the most votes in the history of csm due to him being trustworthy in gamereal life careers and skills have come into play in past elections seleene mittani and pretty much all candidates have at least mentioned what they do and tried to spin it as to why that means we should vote for them how much of an impact did these claims have i dont know but it comes up real life skills are important for csm members if this proposal works players will have absolutely no way to investigate the accuracy of the players claims about this perhaps that means players wont get elected unless they do indeed give their real names in that case this proposal wont change anythingagain i dont really care that much there are allot of odd players here ccp promotes the game as a way to pursue unhealthy grudges against others i mean the one ad had a guy plotting for months or even years to avenge the loss of his cruiser that probably cost a dollar thats not normal healthy human behavior in that ad the odd player gets his revenge in game what if his in game plan failed we are left to wonder what that sort of person does then make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
why is posting someones name on a forum such as failheap character assassinationyour just getting a bit looney with your concerns about character assasinationand what is so wrong with real life laws that protect real life people there are laws to protect people in real life and there are laws to protect free flow of information the free flow of information is often important so that people can make informed decisions in an election your proposal wont prevent people from giving their name if they want it just makes it so people dont have to give their name so i dont really have a problem with proposal i think the whole proposal is just overly dramaticmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
again i dont know what you are talking about with jade but darius had some unknown people on the internet accuse him of breaching a contract to the extent they had good evidence to support their claim then darius may and perhaps should have real life consequences to the extent they had little or no evidence to support their claim darius does not have real life consequences real life is not that bad the csm are a bunch of thirty something people who can take care of themselves make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
the entire context of this conversation is based around the rl ramifications of using someones real name you continually make statements like how in the  do you expect me to take your comments you are shifting goalposts like a  here and im about a quarter inch from blocking all your posts as being from an obvious trollliang
stop troll poasting long enough to read the thread at leastliang
it means i am a reasonable person and acknowledge some reasons for your proposal even though i think it is mostly based on undue drama but in the end i guess i sort of wish ccp wouldnt promote the game as something for people who are not healthy enough to simply get over the loss of a spacepixel cruiser that would be one way to address the issue i raiseyour solution is to sort of just to accept that the people who play this game are so unhealthy ccp shouldnt even publish the names of the csm candidates for fear they will be attacked anything is possible in life so yes it can possibly happen but i think you are being overly dramatic with this stuffi would prefer that ccp encourage healthy people to play the game instead of just taking the line that no one in this game should ever know your real name or you are likely to be attacked its just a difference of approachmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
signedccp dont reveal real life names of csm candidates this should increase the personal safety of the csm member and limit liability for any persons concernedcsm candidates as players can reveal their rl names any time they want anywayrudeness is the weak mans imitation of strength  eric hoffer
youre the only man on that sinking ship cearain 07
i am not nor will i ever be a goon henchmanliang just hit the nail spot on also i would like to see your socalled proof for those allegations else tos 2 is directly applicable to youyou may not use any abusive defamatory ethnically or racially offensive harassing harmful hateful obscene offensive sexually explicit threatening or vulgar language alternate spelling or partial masking of such words will be reprimanded in the same manner as the actual use of such words stop hiding behind an alt or are you just so darn afraid of what the bad goonies might do to you ingamei post my anti goon stuff with my main the worst that can happen is i that i need to be carefull as whom to trust in the game but that has been a reality already since 2004 so nothing new under the sunthey might blob me heck they wouldnt be the first and wont be the last to blob methey might troll me roflmao yeah right i careand for your information the mittani would never ever pull his wife into this kind of crap and most certainly not in a manner like you claim that alone should get you at the very least a 30 day banwe will see how the report will work out for you
the only thing i will add in regards to kittens is that whether ccp posted his real name or not people would still be well aware of who is due to his own self promtingthe same can be said for eva jobsewhilst i have no issue with ccp no longer publishing the real names of future csm candidates ccp can not have a blanket ban on their real names being announced on the forums if the a csm such as kittens or eva decided to release that information on external sitesif they chose to do that they then have to expect the possible consequences of that action
ok i read about what jade wrote yes indeed what he describes is exactly the reason why i would prefer not to give my real name basically some people  goonswarm  take this game way too seriously i mean its not jades alliance that is going to be doing the same crap he describes from goons for the most part everyone in the game thinks what goons are doing is the mark of being a loser but there they are being promoted by ccp what he describes is why i am not necessarilly against the proposalbut here are couple of points1 this proposal only treats the symptoms not the cause it says this game is has so many real life losers that unlike every other game i know of ccp has to basically treat our democratically elected csm members as if they are in a witness protection program so this proposal is a step in that direction but i would ask ccp to explore why it is that this game is so unique in the percentage of losers its attracting that your proposal is garnering such great support are they marketingpromoting the game as a game for shmarmy losers like the people who are likely to do that to jade eve is a great game i am glad there are scams and all sorts of people playing it but do we have to celebrate everytime someone profits from the most base lie great ingenious scams from guiding hand yes great stuff putting regular ravens on contracts and calling them navy ravens again and again and again  its not really a great thing for the game imo simple lying for personal gain not so great imoi doubt most people who play the game are constantly scamming people yet eve gives this image this game has so much going for it why pigeon hole the game as a game for weasels the single shard the complexity of the economy the real loses that can translate to cash and makes pvp exciting i dont know that any of these things would come to mind from non eve players before eve would be perceived as a game that celebrates weaselly back stabbing and yes indeed we end up with a high percentage of real life losers i guess i would much prefer that instead of putting a bandaid on this ccp actually addressed why it is that this game has gotten to the state where it even has to consider these sorts of measures some things are out of their control but some things are in their control what are they doing about the marketing and information that is in their control 2 jade said all this happened to him because he had to give his name to be on csm well is he really sure this would be the answer in fact jade said this would have to go further than your proposal you agreed in the thread but did not add that to the actual op that is why there is some confusion about what you are proposing i mean lets assume he didnt have to give his name lets further assume he could run for csm and actually get elected without giving his real name now there would likely be goons on the csm would he always use and allias when talking with them and everyone in iceland no one would be able to identify him by seeing him no one in his alliance would get butthurt and tell someone else his real identity i dont know perhaps this would work but it seems awefully convoluted make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
is there any other game sport or hobby where democratically elected representatives have thier names kept secretmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
what other game do you know of that has democratically elected representatives for its playerbase who get insider access to developer resourcesfrankly it feels a bit naive that you dont believe that out of hundreds of thousands of players there would be plenty of immature asshats with some even willing to act out that asshattery irl the csms can take very controversial stances on issues and they need to be able to hold those stances without fearing for their personal safety the spirit of the game inspires no holds barred behavior and this proposal would help keep that behavior in game where it is appropriate rather than letting it spill over irl where it is not
what does access to developer resources which csm really doesnt have have to do with anything just about every major game sport and hobby has amature associations with many with elections for offices they all have controversial issues this idea would be absurd for them the spirit of all games and sports is to try to win within the game why does eve seem to attract so many losers that are eager to go outside the gamemake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
my personal opinion on why eve attracts people who like to scam love the whole metagaming aspect back stabbing stealing and many other things which you might call negative aspects is most likely because there is no other mmo where you can these thingsyou sell a product on its uniqueness and eves is the fact that you can do things as well as many other things i also would also like to add that people who you would describe as idiots asshats etc are not unique to eve for from it but the major difference is in other mmos they can only have a very limited effect on your game play in eve they can have a major effect on your game play i understand where you are coming from the problem is whether ccp and csm decided to no longer give out their real names i can see it making very little differenceat some point with eve being the game it is the information would get out very quickly one way or anotherfor me that is the real issue lets say hypothetically ccp did not release the names of the csm members both ankhesentapemkah and kittens real name would have still been used simply because they both put the information out their numerous times of their own free willso because they have done that can ccp realistic ban his name from being mentioned on the eve forums without looking ridiculous
im not comparing it to rl sports and hobbies as there everyone uses their real identity compare this to other online communities like reddit i wouldnt trust my rl details with any of those guys because people turn into something else when given the anonymity they get behind a pseudonym  be it an eve avatar or a reddit username the game being playable behind this mask from the privacy of your own home means that it is far more accessible to people with few ideas of social acceptability of certain behaviors all of this is also compounded with the atmosphere of eve which is competitive to the point of cutthroat adversarialism to make it a much more toxic environment to give away rl details in than say your local fencing club
ok i agree with your position to some extent internet communities tend to be less controlled due to anonymity but this proposal seems to take us even more in that direction right i mean instead of saying we as a community of players and game owners will not stand for the crap jade allegedly had to put up with from goons we seem to be saying yeah that will happen letUFFFDs try to hide from it many groups now are organized over the internet i played chess for a few years  mostly over the internet people are very competitive and often socially awkward in that game yet i didnt think that by giving my name out i would end up with people sending faxes to my workplace along the lines of what jade describes from goons yes for some sports games and hobbies you show up in person and are seen in person some youUFFFDre not but the csm shows up in person too so it would be especially odd to still try to maintain that anonymity make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
were saying both of those things its like saying that you wont put up with crime in your city and at least want to make efforts to stop it but in the meantime you also refuse to abstain from walking down dark sketchy alleyways the former is proper action the latter is just prudence as the problem will likely not be solved 100  at least not in the short termthe names of csms may get out anyway leaks friend telling a friend telling a friend etc and thats when its important for us to not stand for the crap some people do when they take rivalries outside of the game however preventive measures to not get to that point are prudent at least until some sort of change happens in the community im sure they wont maintain the ingame personas and names in person but thats 12 supposedly trustworthy people knowing your name rather than thousands of nerdraging baddies who take an internet spreadsheet game too seriouslywhen meeting in person and collaborating a real name is useful to better know the person youre dealing with in the csm election though the rl name of candidates is largely irrelevant i dont care if the mittanis name was alex or bob or jeanpierre and frankly its not my business to care about that i dont see how its the business of any other eve player either
just want to say this is a pretty damned good post and yes it is very important we dont lose sight of the cause of the problem which is lunatics using peoples rl details to try to bully their way to an ingame victory they are not capable of gaining with gamplay alone neither i nor any other eve player should have to put up with having my rl dragged through the mud because i am ingame enemies with the serious internet spaceship goonswarm sa crowd to a large degree ccp have a responsibility in this they could and should have reacted more decisively when example of rl harrassment have occured and they could certainly have worked harder to differentiate genuine eve shennanigans in game from the kind of taudry something awful forums style ooc harrassment that the game has lately become known for i do recognize that supporting this proposal is a kind of admission of defeat ie accepting that ccp is unwilling to control the goonswarm abuses against real players so the players themselves need to be anonymous but shrugs to be quite honest life is too short to be explaining to ones bosses that the obscene photoshopped pictures arriving by company email are because some basementdwelling nerds in america are taking internet spaceship wars too seriously
its a matter of revealing true names to people who are hiding behind pseudonymsthis is an asymmetric situation and leads to abuseid like someone to come up with an example of such an asymmetric situation that hasnt been abused
before i start i do not condone anything that has been aim at yourself jade nor some of the things that were aim at alexccp are in a very difficult position when things are said and done which are outside of their domainin game then yes ccp have a responsibility however outside of the their domain what realistic can they doall i can say is that those who do such reprehensible acts are nothing but cowards in real life and are not worth a second of your timegoing slightly off topic i would love to see somebody from goonswarn explain how they find what has happened to you funny and how they can be a part of an organisation which allows this kind of behaviouri either expect to see no answer or something of the lines of you always get a few bad apples and we cant control what people say which to me just a cop out
zero tolerance for people linking rl pictures and contact details in game or on these forums zero tolerance for ooc bullying and metagaming against the player rather than the character if we have another smoske or lady scarlet situation in eve online then heads need to roll immediately and brutally so the lesson gets learned by the sa crew that if they dont learn a minimum standard of respect for their fellow players they dont get to play at all and of course some more backbone in general when talking on the big 00 blocks i think most people would agree that mittani should have been permabanned from the csm for what he did actually making that judgment would have done much to symbolize ccps discouragement of ooc attacks and anti player metagamingbullying the current rather silly compromise means were going to be having these same discussions a year from now when mittani tries to run for csm againwell through the grapevine i generally hear its nothing to do with me  i dont control the wikiemailhostingserverwhatever it is the old defense of it was somebody else in the swarm wot did it  i just laughed at ityeah its a cop out but i guess these guys dont join up with an online bullying community to demonstrate strength of character
this has been the primary reason ive never considered running for csm having any of my real life information associated with my in game information would fundamentally change the way i would be able to play the game comfortably i have pissed off other players in game enough that they threw a fit and claimed they would hunt me down irl i am sure most have been on the receiving end of messages like that before the anonymity of being a character in eve allows me to shrug and laugh it off
1the support feature of the old forums was rather helpful unlike the like things we have now

ive been a pirate for about a year now i love being a pirate but there are things that are broken about it as a way of eve lifegcc is far too long i get to play for a few hours a day after any engagement i have to sit in a safe or station for 15 minutes before i can play again we are a pirate corp we have an office in low sec if we declare ourselves a pirate corp and set up home in low sec we should get benefits less or no gcc no gate  station gun aggression within our own system  constellation we keep the wheels of industry turning by blowing up ships  being blown up we pay over the odds for stuff when we want a ship  mods now rather than waiting for an alt to go to hisec for it we are denied safe access to hisec but then get punished for our lifestyles in lo toopiracy is one of the funnest lives in eve its small gang pvp at its finest and yet we are the outcasts of eve punished from all sides and have to put up with poor under stocked  over priced markets at the same timegive piracy a break no gcc for pirates no gun aggression within home systems  constellations bonus to market buying  contract accepting skills for those with 5 or less sec status or something to help us spend our illgotten gainsgive us something anything
i have a hard time understanding why you should get a free pass for being a piratepirates had the same challenges in history dealing with the lawthe movies are a misconceptionthey didnt have it easy eithercrying about it isnt going to help eitherif you dont want to deal with gccthen go to 00pleasekeep cryingits funnier than hell stop the evemail spam
ah im sorry maybe the first paragraph escaped your attention i love being a pirate does that sound like someone crying to you i am merely proposing fixes that would attract more players to both pvp and low sec i think the 00 crowd have been well and truly catered for and pampered thanks to the last csm and fixing fw isnt the half of life in low sec go laugh somewhere else  your laughter is just tears in the post for me
hahahahahahahaoh yeah of course would you also perhaps like free vindicators and machs what about being immune to warp scramblers and tech 4 damage mods as wellso the op is either a troll or a dribbling moron place your bets gentlemenon a serious note the penalties you suffer are the price you pay for attacking people in lowsec working as intended htfu and deal with it

learn to tank gatestation guns betterdont kid yourselves most piracy in eve is about the same as a dozen guys standing outside a door and beating anyone who steps through it i have no objection to mugging people in such a fashion but to call it the height of pvp is absurdim against a lot of what ccp has done to harm piracy in general but stopping gate guns in lowsec thats just crazy talk
slow deliberatesincere and loud appluase stop the evemail spam
you forgotdeal with it
this kind of attitude leads to bad bad things goons have always said they want to ruin your game not the game and they have held true to that the entire time ive been playing just because you dont like it is no reason to call for a cull of the playerbase edit by the way im fairly sure there is no such word as democratical
no you misunderstand dustie we dont want to destroy everybodys game just your game dustie pyryt you are the only one we have any interest in messing with
i would really like to see random npc battles between the factions at war to me little things like that make fw just that much more interesting and fun to be in ccp take notice of this1 susan
1 internets to susan
very nice and wisei like very much the part with capsuleers involved in npc battles it could be done with a kind of special missions from frigates to bs and it looks like an arena maybe with restricted gates shiptype and number of people easily solved with an agent that gives you a certain number of tags for you and your gang to activate the gate  same for your opposite fwgood jobo7agha
the parts about occupancy level directly affecting income and pvp bleeding into highsec sound good so does the fixes and rebalances part now while i see the reason for this alts im worried this will turn lowsec too much into an fwonly zone people will be forced to either leave that part of lowsec or join factional warfare against their will because thats the only way they can get access to stationsi think a good middle ground would be to either allow neutrals to dock or only restrict docking in factionspecific stations such as 24th imperial crusade or tribal liberation forcealso to fulfill my role as the eternal dissident i dont know if more pve and missions is the way to go level 5 missions will attract more mission runners who dont contribute at all to the pvp side of fw we already have enough of those the random encounters may also do the sameid tie fw missions to pvp in some way maybe allow one mission per kill or something similar to avoid too much mission running by people who dont actually take part in fwjust my thoughts please dont hate me
i wish you were on ts3 last nightwe had about a 1 hour discussion on fw and this would have been a really good point to make since the biggest discussion point was on whether neutral should have access to stations or notill probably be addressing this on my blog later today but i think the issue you brought up is not one ive previously considered and something im definitely going to muse on for a whilewwwgamerchicknet gamerchick42

bots can be programmed to scan you knowand some of us just dont care about rpso no
not that i particularly agree with the op but do you have any evidence that there is a scanning bot ive certainly never heard of onecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
if they can mine roids or gank rats they can use dscan or probesits all in the configas for substantive evidence i have none but it doesnt take allot of imagination and common sense to see its plausible
i especially like the part where you use evidence to support your hypothesisprobing is different from utilizing dscan or killing rats due to the fact that it requires intuitive use of a 3 dimensional interface but if you wish for evidence beyond that just look at the bots available none of them have probing functionalityit doesnt take a lot of imagination or common sense to claim that incursion bots are plausible that doesnt mean its technically possible or viable no matter how much imagination you have technical limitations are technical limitationscenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
i was on the sites that sell botting programs just to do research honestdiscussing the way someone may go about cheating is frowned upon by ccp
bots and their capabilities are well known discussion of them is frowned upon only when you are naming them linking to sites or to a lesser degree promoting their usecenteri dont troll i just give overly blunt responses that annoy people who are wrong but dont want to admit it its not my fault that people have sensitive feelings mxzfcenter
ive suggesting this for a while give barges and exhumers a new high slot expressly built for a new mining probe launcher that fires specialized probes that only detect grav sites remove belts and replace them with grav sites that always respawn in system during downtime it wont eliminate botting but it will make it harder
there are to many abandoned poss around for me to support making it even easier to establish them in hisec
would be nice if by cutting a roid a certain way etc with a few simply commands you could potential cut chunks of it out showing more rarer minerals inside and have so there is a bit of unluck that you could potential hit a rather volatile mineral to break it up etc it would add lock times to the strip miner cds etc can make the process more interactive via warnings etc and stuff you can catch and alter coarse as needed etc i dunno would be interesting to have asteriods and mine sweeper molded in and for those who dont want it you can keep mining directly into the core as usual
having to move more between roids would just  off actual human beings bots dont care
fix wardecs by removing anonymity from public station services if a pilotcorp uses a public lab or production slot put their name up on the science  industry display if they place a buysell order put their name on the market display this will allow aggressive griefer corps to focus attacks on productive corps that either have a reason to fight or have the money to hire someone to fight in their place it will make being extremely productive carry the risk of someone else noticing it may even spark conflict coercion or cooperation among competitors this sounds like evefor those that insist on staying in npc megacorps make them pay the kind of broker and station service fees befitting a representative of a hugely rich organization if placing market orders using station slots or refining oreloot carried fees akin to the 11 mission tax it would allow new or very casual members to give these activities a try while those that were ready to set up shop and make a business out of it would have to join or make a player corp in order to be competitive

not that im against thisbut as per the keynote this seems a bit of a waste of timeits quite obvious they are quite literally bringing a ton of new avatar stuff coming and its quite obvious they plan to add many many thingskinda stating the obvious by making a proposalbut yeah stop the evemailUFFFDspam
i put it to you it must have affected someone or you wouldnt be gcc
logis would still work as they do now if someone assists they become flashy to you and you can shoot them though this will be addressed in future patches from mu understanding this is basically a mutually agreed upon aggression timer with all the consequences that come with it

another idea since this is pretty much exclusively a hisec pos issue is make them consume starbase charters even when offline when it runs out anyone would be able to report the tower to the proper authorities maybe even just a rightclick option which would in turn send a mail to the corp controlling the tower giving them x amount of days to put more charters in or the pos will be removedthis way if the corp controlling the tower is active and still wants it but maybe has shut production down or plans to sell the tower etc has recourse and anyone who finds a truly abandoned tower can get it out of the way maybe even add a small standings bump for reporting towers to encourage people to actively clean the moons out its also basically griefproof  which sounds silly to say in the context of eve but with something like this meant only to clear abandoned moons taken by corpsplayers which may not be active anymore its important imo
in my opinion a lot of people are smoking crack in this thread op your idea is an interesting start but the idea needs a lot of work especially before being posted in the assembly hallyou really should present it more clearly and even link to at least some of the 100 other threads similar to this until then fi   we need a method to remove pos space junk frankly poss have too many hit points and dont drop anything of value to be worth the time and energy of their removal having the ability to salvage them is a good idea the notion that you have to anchor the hacking module is very interesting i really dislike the idea of having a module do your dirty hacking work while you are awayofflineuntouchable but if the hacking module is worth enough perhaps the risk vs reward concept can be maintained as can be seen from pos aggression mechanics there is probably a serious difficulty in getting the anchorable hacking unit to aggress the tower im very weary of how they implement this this is a form of aggression plain and simple youre taking something which isnt yours and as such the mechanics need to reflect this imo attacking a hisec pos should require a wardec whether its offline or not you tried to balance your aggression by being flagged someone or something like a can thief i highly doubt you realize that aggression mechanics are changing this summer so thieves can be shot by anyone not just the corp from whom they stole this makes your proposal a little bit more interesting as anyone could then shoot the hacking module unfortunately its only the anchorable structure doing the aggressing which youre making invulnerable the idea of an invulnerable hacking modules is so obnoxiously bad im at a loss for words do you know risk vs reward is a fundamental tenet of eve do you know what that means if you want that tower then you have to risk something in short  no to your invulnerability idea if you want to claim an offline tower you need to risk your  deal with it but but you made it vulnerable when  no you didnt your mechanics for making it vulnerable are bullshit these whiners asking for a week for the process to complete are you  serious absolutely not a pos is a corp asset and while you might be the only real person in the corp the mechanics should be setup around real corps with multiple real players in them you dont get a  week to prepare for a wardec and you shouldnt get a  week to save your offline tower from being stolen i find 3 days excessive but i agree you need a little warning as such i highly recommend that stealing highsec poss requires a wardec and then maybe up to 24 hours to steal if you want a full weak then that hacking module needs to be able to hack online towers too imo when you join a player corp you accept the risks of wardecs when you anchor a pos you accept the risks that someone will take it from you deal with it
this is not an exclusive hisec issue there is pos crap littered all over the universe as taking the time to kill a pos just isnt worth it except under specific circumstances
tracking ccp already have plans for fixing thatdamage increase whytitan limit can you think of a method to implement this that wouldnt unbalance something else while also getting the job done that also takes less time to code than just fixing the titansuperweapon
id actually rather like certain goons to try and hunt me down in real life would be an interesting face to face discussion
yeah sure good proposal ill support itnot like i care who you are anyways its what you accomplish to enhance the game for me anywaysand as to the encounters at ccp i may be socially misfunctionate or less eliquent but imo it would work perfectly fine to just talk on a firstname basis its not all poshy formal crap anyways its about a couple of people csm and ccp alike to talk about a game and how to better it
this discussion is purely academic imo because even if ccp decided to stop providing the csms personal details this information will get known sooner or later one way or anothertherefore we should be talking about how things should be dealt with once this information is abused
ok i can agree with this but what efforts are they making to stop it they and we as a community seem to be encouraging the groups that commit the crimes the community is constantly raving about how wonderful goonswarm and mittani are so is ccp i mean come one how stupid are we we are encouraging those who do this  and then we complain that it happens and want new rules to protect us to stick with the crime analogy its like the governement ccp is puting out pr pieces for the worst criminals and and people watching it are sending fan mail to the criminals but then they complain that crime is increasing and by the way this topic is not about in game scams or in game treachery the only real concern i have is the stuff that goons does i mean sure some murder or something over a game is always possible but i dont really think there is substantially more chance of that in eve than any other sportgame or hobby but the stuff jade complained  we all know this happens mittani even spoke about how goons did it to some other lawyer who was a player and if i recall he was saying he didnt want to give his real name before he retired because of this what do we and ccp do well ccp and the players celebrate the same people who do this crap as to what ccp can do beyond not publicly promoting groups that they are pretty sure do this i agree that may be difficult i mean now you can simply read posts by jade and he will be followed on these forums by goons trying to defame him in real life so yeah now we can clearly see it is the goons but if ccp did start to crack down it woudl simply move underground there would just be alt accounts made doing the same thing so again im not sure an explicit rule needs to be made wich cant be enforced it may be better to let groups like goons be open about their out of game asshattery so we as a community can clearly identify who it is but ffs dont keep celebrating the groups that do this yes people join goons and come into the game from goons but also other people tired of eve because of the crap they pull whether this proposal is passed or not i dont really care but what i would like is the fact that this proposal even gets so much support to be a wake up call for ccp and the community that we shouldnt be promoting groups like goons and others that pull this out of game crap as far as ingame scams and treachery i dont think the game mechanics should change at all however constantly marketing the game as a game for weasels is a bit disappointing perhaps just perhaps all the claims that i am an  in game but not out of game arent really factual perhaps some people like playing an  in game because well they are assholes there are other very nice features of the game besides being able to back stab friends make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i would agree to this for any other game but eve being eve i dont think it would even be in the best interest of the candidates to remain anonymous to the broad community if that happens well be voting for ingame characters and not for real people for instance i voted for alex gianturco for the csm but i would never vote for the mittanii mean i can see a difference and i know others can too but i also know most cant and thats a shame and in the end i think that the mittani and really everyone who plays this game have very often contributed to blur the line between ingame character and rl personality and perhaps trying to sharpen and define that more clearly could be helpful however to be honest i think a breathalyser test before any eve player speaks publicly at a ccp sponsored event could go a long way
not putting ones rl name out there and instead going only by your ingame name is not the same as being anonymous its pseudonymity and its more than good enough for csm elections where one ought to be judged on their everelated credentials and good or bad name if some csm candidates feel it can help their campaign and they arent worried about possible consequences they should be allowed to reveal their rl name but surely it shouldnt be an obligation as it discourages those who wantneed to maintain some level of separation between their rl privatework life and eve hobby from running and in most cases this information is of no benefit to the voters or the csm as a wholecopypasta from sboi because it sums up my thoughts on the matter
agreed  although i think there should be more to it still such as requirements for even posting here
more would be nice but cant we all agree to at least get it to where it used to be 1st shouldnt this be super important to everyone using this forum should have every csm member posting here alreadynot because im important but because this section of the forum is
but there is a two stepback on topicimo there should actually be another very important addition to the assembly hall there should be a way to insure most of the posts contain fully developed and thought out ideas far to often the posts are the written form of verbal diarrhea that resulted from someones undeveloped brainfarts  these should be in fi
a voting system serves no purpose over a likes system why introduce it
running a bot is the mmo equivalent of murder so yea ban should be permanent glad ccp is stepping up i have never seen a game so soft on cheaters then eve
lol wut says who you hooooo thats funnyno but seriously ccps statistics show that over 90 of players who botted and received a temp ban dont bot again add to the fact that much if not all of their illgotten gains have been seized ccp wants to keep players and stop botting looks like they found a good solutionwell see how effective this temp ban really is the next time we see statistics on how many players are botting if it drops significantly then ccps method of bot discouragement  player retention is proven effectivesummary of eves last four expansions
reported by ccp sreegs  20120403 195049  commentsmonths and months and monthsyou see this  has a time machine
each of those players can be turned into a well behaved paying customerwhilst i would like to nail each botter and hang them by the larger of their testicles i completely understand ccp not wanting to ban everybody on their first offence and to try and turn them into good paying citizens of new edenif i remember rightly only 85 of players continue botting after they are first caught that is a good chunk revenue saved by not intsa banningif you do not understand this then dear lord never start your own business
id like to point out that botters get more than just a small banning at least now now they get the assets they gained by botting removed which can be quite a substantial hit imagine if you won the lottery how much would you spend how much of your money would you be wreckless with then imagine someone comes along and takes that lottery money away from you after you had a month to spend it i think the current punishments fit the crime pretty well  loss of their botting profits temporary ban characters locked to their account so they can no longer sell off their characters
lolbeen watching this stuff for some timeeveryone talks about it and thinks ccp is doing nothingyet they obviously areand ramping it up quite noticiblygo back in the archives and dev blogsold forum topicsthey have brought this up before stop the evemail spam

as a fellow pirate nodevelop a black market yesmaybe allow pirate corps to affiliate with npc pirate corps for lp access maybe maybe allow some specific missions lp rewards maybe something that does not improve your sec status  long shot not needed but not a bad ideathe ability to influence a home system that would be a mechanic for all of lowsec corps with appropriate benefits not just piratesgcc timer deal with it it does not lock you in place cloak agile tanky etc my only issue is the new disable warping in empire for a gcc from lowsec but apparently that was an exploit they tolerated until people started boomeranging freightersand no piracy is not waiting to mug someone on the other side of a door with 12 people that is boring and no fun at all best to burst through the door with guns blazing and ransoming the last guy standing
i disagree on many pointsgcc only effects frigates destroyers and idiots im all for shortening the timer based on your ship size but it works just finegun aggression is fine for the same reason stated abovethe market is fine as it is in fact i would say its better in low sec as you are completely capable of manipulating it all by yourselfthe only thing you should give pirates is the ability to not be kos to npc pirates im all for fixing lowsec but giving us bonuses to being 5 isnt the answer pvp should be your reward and finding more ways to populate low sec would be a better use of our theorycrafting timethis is sooooo true only the three things i mentioned above have an issue with gate guns so you can even travel to a new system if needed
as a person who must defend himself from persons of hostile intent read anybody in a combat ship in low sec i agree that the gcc timer in low sec way too long sec status keeping pirates out of high sec is enough punishment shorten gcc timer ccp
you are criminal its not supposed to be easy for you
you think it is unreasonable that you might be in trouble for a whole 15 minutes with the local police after attacking someone what the heck no why on earth would you get thatyes that seems to be a pretty reasonable description of how law worksyou honestly expect concord and players you prey upon to praise you for what you do seriouslyno
you are makeing it a different itemin the database you have one entry row for dominix standard freshly builtif you add builders you then get multiple rowsdominix built by industrialist001 standard freshly builtdominix built by industrialist002 standard freshly builtdominix built by industrialist003 standard freshly builtalso when you repackage a ship it goes back to its standard entry so will probably loose the makers marki hope this makes sence and is correct i am explaining this pretty basicly and i am sure ccps databases are far from basicjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
its a nice idea but its a database nightmare to program some other games can get away with this because the amount of items crafted by other players is small compared to all the items that come from npcs since the vast majority of items in eve are crafted by other players keeping track of who made what is a bit too muchsummary of eves last four expansions
interesting idea but not terribly practical or useful definitely one of those if they ever get around to it things
do you really think they have different database items for every bpo item 1 bpo with me 0 pe 1item 2 bpo with me 1 pe 1 in reality each database item has several fields and im sure there is an me level field and a pe level field im sure each assembled ship has a field for its current armor level or structure level each assembled module has a field for its current damage level to implement this they would need to add a manufacturers id field to every manufactured item in the game and then they would need to create a manufacturer id table that linked the stamp to the manufacturers id they would need to find a method to display this information such that it becomes known  usable this is still not a trivial task and would require an large amount of effort and major database changes but its not unimplementable the question is would the effort be worth the reward what benefits does this add to the game 1 the ability to identify who built what could be used for metagaming if you can identify the source of the item you can arrange an attack on the manufacturers to perhaps corner the market and become the major producer it could allow someone like goons to find more chinks in the economy that they can wreak havoc upon i consider the added metagaming prospects a huge positive but i dont think it by itself warrants the effort required2 brand loyalty  this doesnt exist unless you can a see the manufacturer of the item before you purchase it and b actually buy from their specific order which you cant at the moment because to my knowledge you always buy from the cheapest sell order at the station rather than from the order you click on without the ability to discriminate whom youre purchasing from brand loyalty doesnt exist 3 game immersion  maybe 4  i dont know we need more reasons to implement this besidesit would be neat someone come up with some good ideas because i really like the metagaming potential assuming its implemented right finally this is in the wrong forum move it to fi assembly hall is for well developed ideas and this idea is about as well developed as a toddlers chest hair
you could store an most recently assembled on date but it would be impossible to store the manufacturer or build date without completely breaking stacking or market use gizznitt malikite got it half right it is possible to store peritem attributes  but only for unpackaged items this is why you cant repackage bpos once youve used them for instance and why bpcs cant be stacked the ops idea storing the manufacturer and creation date is flat out impossible with the current database structure it just isnt possible an assembly date statistic is possible but it doesnt mean a ton since you can reset it any time you want at the cost of the rigs
i used assembled because i realize that packaged items have different set of database fields than unpackaged items i have no idea what the current database structure holds so i dont know what is or is not possible imo adding manufacturer info would probably require a ton of work on the database and i really think we need to provide justification for this effort beyond wouldnt it be cook if on another note i wonder what would happen to the eve database if there was an eve wide unpackage day where most of the eve players unpackaged their items how much strain would this actually cause
this idea has been suggested many times before  why didnt you post in one of those threads and look at the comments already posted there before creating this new and worthless post nothing said here is new at least since your name is here we know who is to blame for the repetition
i like a lot of what you put outim against any denial of docking in any way shape or form fluff is not rules and usually leads to bad mechanics long run when you try to apply game play elements from the fluff standpoint there are better negative things that can be done like shutting of station services rather then out right keeping you from docking that could be done i dont like the push to make low sec fw into null light that ccp is trying to go with heck soundwaves interview was scary as it came off as if he has no connection to the fw community and what they want space wizards are real they can make 10058 votes vanish and for a moment i hurd 10k goons cry out then silence 
already a thread here which is probably in wrong place fanfest faction warfare
i have to agree with him currrently the plexxing mechanics can bring about good quality pvp steps can be taken to increase the pvp for occupancy but your proposal seems to increase the importance of pve instead of pvp for example you just say missioning should lead to change of occupancy but dont explain why also as far as adding random npc battles i have to say i hope shooting these red crosses wouldnt effect occupancy but by and large i just see that sort of like when incursions go to low sec systems what happens those systems are avoided it always sounds good to talk about new ais and new npcs in what if terms however when they are actually added to the game people soon realize that playing against a computer ai is never nearly as fun as playing against other players what are your thoughts on thatother than that i think a graduated system is ok i do think one side will gain momentum and steamroll the other side if the benefits of joining the winning side are as good as the op seems to suggest what will happen then do you think some sort of balancing mechanism should be usedas far requireing faction war players to form groups in order to make isk i am against it being limitted to level 3 missions when there are others doing level 5s would suck i have very few nights where i can fully dedicate 2 straight hours to eve with headset and mic when i do have those times i would like to do pvp not mission i would prefer to do missions on the times where i may only have a bit of time here and there to play eve  and that means solo i realize i may be more casual than even most fw players but i hope the drive to make fw like null sec doesnt leave me out make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
the ramifications of removing static belts goes beyond mining and i feel are being overlooked by many who are posting in this thread there are plenty of people that rat in highlownull for bounties rep grinding isk making etc the static belts also give way to pvp in the belts removing static belts in lownull and requiring them to be scanned with a probe launcher will be a massive change to the fabric of low and nullccp would need to balance the mining aspect with the pve and pvp relationships of belts
already a large portion of pvp happens on gates and stations and waiting at top belt pvp would just change to waiting at top planet pvp so is your objection that ratters and miners will be too safe from roaming ganks
didnt ccp rework roid spawning specifically to counter stripping belts immediately after dt seems to me that if there was ever an incentive to bot an all or nothing mechanic would be a good one vov
a large potion of pvp also happens away from gates and stations you can also disguise waiting at the top belt to look like pve or other activities it is part of the risk factor of lownull most lowsec combat probers can usually nail anything bigger than a frig in 23 scans tops so its not a matter of tracking things down either ratting in ships with tight setups that now need to squeeze a probe launcher or pvp setups without a dedicate scout would be most affected contrary to popular belief the solo pilot is not dead yet
i dont worry about solo pilots solo is dead has been around for so long i cannot remember the first time i saw it out of all players the solo ones are the most adaptivein regards to disguising things to look like pve when i find a ship in a belt with dscan i usually think bait can i kill him before his friends show up can i gtfo if i cant handle it when i find a ship in a missiondedanom i am much more tempted to get cocky and be like ima kill dis caerbarelololol i wonder if making belts scanned doesnt make baiting more effectiveyour point about ship fitting selection changes is true but i am not sure this is a convincing argument for devs like soundwave given some of the comments he has recently made vovanyway i was just curious about the reasoning behind thinking it constitutes a massive change to the fabric of lownull not trying to argue any point
 thistheres no mechanic that addresses abandoned poss in fact there are a lot of problematic issues regarding poss in general they need to be addressed firstsummary of eves last four expansions
pos are very annoying to remove especially in highsec even if they are offline the are also very annoying to get setup especially in highsec where you need very high corp standings both of these mechanics need a review

sounds like you have a limited vision of a mmorpg this game has mining and trading and building because some people want to do that if all of that is irrelevant to you then why dont you just play a game purely focused on fighting if thats all youre interested in why is it necessary  and why do you think you have the right  to try to make others play the way you want instead of forcing everyone to do at least some fighting  how would you like it if everyone was forced to do at least some mining eve is permeated by this kind of attitude of intolerance to other peoples gaming preferences no wonder so many people quit this game who wants to be friends with the kind of people they meet hereonce dust starts making real money the cost and hassle of keeping up eve wont be worth it unless more players join and stay if you want to have a place to play in the future youd better start thinking in terms of the viability of the game as a whole in order for ccp to make more money on dust than they do on eve they need to sell about 100k copiesmo here are the sales figures from some popular console games152m  halo 3 odst  xbox 360443k  wii sports resort  wii290k  madden nfl 10  xbox 360258k  mario  luigi bowsers inside story  ds254k  the beatles rock band  xbox 360247k  madden nfl 10  playstation 3236k  marvel ultimate alliance 2  xbox 360213k  batman arkham asylum  playstation 3211k  guitar hero 5  xbox 360209k  the beatles rock band  wiipersonally i dont really care what people do with their time in eve the only thing i do feel strongly about it not letting anyone think they have the right to tell others what part of the game they should be playing stay in your own sandbox and play with the people who want to play with you think of it this way if people dont want to participate in your wardec it probably means they dont like you youll have to change yourself  not the game  in order to fix that
bumping this seriously ccp how hard would it be to add horizontal scrollbars

ships already dont look like theyre centered on the pad when youre viewing them from cq so you could just argue theyre parked closer or farther from your cq dockpointanywayyou wanna fix a scale issue fix the scale of stationsthey look way too small in comparison to the number of ships that could potentially be docked inside and some of the ships coming out of the station exit point look way too big to have been inside the station to begin withid like to see stations as enormous things that when youre right up on top of them they fill your screen id like to see a station have several grids thats how big id like to see them spare me the lecture on grid mechanicsjust make it work 
apsolutely supported this is something that has always annoyed me it would be a very simple change to make seeing as that is the way the view from captains quarters was innitially designed and implementedplease make it happensee if you can get some csm support
yes pleaseat the moment i cant really see the differance between a battlecruiser and my charon i think a sence of scale is important in the captains quarters because its almost impossible to get a good sence of scale in space for obvious reasonsand seeing as it would be a really simple change to make and would hopefully take very little of ccps time to implement it should be given some degree of priority no need to put off the simple and easy changesi dont see a down point to this onesupportedin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
becuase you can down vote and there can be just a simple 0100 support count how in the world can you tell the  of people who like something when it counts all of the likes in the whole thread not just the ones on the op post and beyond that how can you trick yourself into thinking the current system is good enough a simple thumbs up thumbs down button on a thread would let people voice the opposite of support right now you can pump up the number of likes by just clicking like on every single post in a thread
good idea maybe a csm member has to move a thread from features and ideas into the assembly hall thus it is used as a tool for the csm to gauge support for a project why should everyone and their mom be able to post something here for instance a thread on how to make this forum useful would be allowed in but some idea about space whales wouldntjust kidding forum warriors i love space whales too p
remove assembly hallmerge with feature in ideasgive feature and ideas the yesnomaybe votes things
absolutely this  also the manufacturer name has to be on the km as well so that an interested party can track by manufacturer if interestedwed have shipspotters all over eve haha
this is a lovely idea however given how many problem this would cause from a programming and database perspective it isnt really viablean idea needs to be thought threw in terms of benefit to the players and ccp ease of implementation and load on the ccp team this would give a small emotive benefit be practically impossible to implement and take up a huge amount of ccp resourcesfor that reason you do not have my supportno support nonein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

after talking to my alliance a bit about docking and sovereignty and etc i came up with the following idea for the docking issue a sort of compromise that allows docking in npc stations in empire for everyone but gives serious benefits for fw pilots to own a station  and consequences for losing ityou can read the whole post here 1 adding defenses to fw only stations though anyone could dock because its empire station guns would shoot hostile militia as well as neutrals who have negative standings with the sovereign factionthe station would also shoot any neutrals with an aggression timer of any kind against the sovereign party as well as any neutrals providing logistics to the hostile party ie if a neutral gang shows up and starts shooting the sovereigns who live there the station will defensively shoot back and hostile faction militia could not easily get around the stations defenses by parking neutral logis outside2 the sovereign party would be the only ones with access to agents obviously3 the station offers free or hugely reduced medical clones to sovereign militia members in addition repair bills for the sovereign holding party are significantly reducedhostile militia pays more for repairs and clones then normal or are heavily taxed in some wayneutrals pay the same as beforeits not perfect but i think this solution accomplishes the following things1 its simple and makes sense if you shoot the owners of the station or at war with them the station shoots at you this would be an easy conceptmechanic for new players to grasp and understand2 it doesnt hurt neutrals but it offers benefits for people living in that station to be in militia3 it offers consequences for losing sovereignty higher prices loss of agents and having to deal with station guns etc4 it impacts pvpers and plexers as well as mission runners loss of agents alone isnt enough5 it offers multiple reasons for militia to take systems whether they actively want to move in or live in that system or simply deal a financial blow to their enemythoughtswwwgamerchicknet gamerchick42

since the forum just ate my 4000 letter postheres the short versiona the 15minute timer punishes the lone wolf in the small ship worse than the stereotype gankercamper youre potraying by your remarks where most of the time the timergcc is ignored  and b it does not help the victim at alland another point virtually all other professions in eve have a game mechanic to support their lifestyle the 00 empire builder with titans and logistical possibilities and conquerable stations the empire mission runner with missions the explorer with exploration sites the roleplayer with faction warfare mechanics etc in the last 4 years all that has changed in lowsec is the occasional 650k battleship rats and the inclusion of incredibly poor anomaliesyeeehaw i want a black market a racketeering station i want to take over the helpless commerce stations littered around lowsec just as much as the fw guy wants to blow up the opposing side for great rewards also faction war territories only spawn fw anomalies you wont find serpentis dens in gallente lowsec fw zonesis this a bug or feature still enjoy my life as a pirate always has always will but the fact is that lowsec has reamined unchanged virtually the last 4 years since all other expansions have brought new stuff and things to do for the empire guy  roleplayer and the 00 empire builder

im not sure if this applies to the warp disruption script ill assume so but i think hics should be able to be remote repaired while hanging on to a supercap etc would make catching supercaps easier

redefining distinction between two roles eves pirates  robbers deceptive 00 status eves bandits  plunderers obvious 00 statusit was said at fanfest that the value of your ship and its contents would be reward to the parties involved with destroying it is this truepersonally i find this logic to be a tad bit lamesuggestion  revised game featuressecurity status rules for high sec all is safe and normal apart from suicide gankers your low security status  50 neglects you from high sec players can destroy your ship your low security status  9451 banishes you from high sec concord will attack your ship but not chase yousecurity status rules for low secyou can still change security status in low sec you lose less security status as you operate in reducing securitylevel systems  03 systems this excludes podkilling eases pain of losing too much security status concord operate in lowsec unlike highsecs concord your good security status rewards you with a level of concords responsiveness  10 your neutral security status leaves you semivulnerable in lowsec 05 09 concord will protect you only if theyre nearby they dont hang around long your bad security status leaves you vulnerable in lowsec  06 concord can not linger in lowsec after their protocol is achieved too many criminal dlowsec firing conditions nondamaging attacks are allowed for 00 players jammers webifiers antiwarp drainers etc contributes to piracy key part of whole post nondamaging attacks are discouraged for 00 players same as above contributes to deception subsequently reduce security status any physical damage unto a goodstatus player will have concord jumpin to save them slowtomedium response any physical damage unto a excellentstatus player will have concord jumpin to save them mediumtofaster response protection speed in low sec concord response in lowsec is conditional and at their own risk they can only match the responsiveness of 05 high sec providing you have  9451 security status quotethe piratethey have the skills to pilot almost any ship by captivating a target completely they can demand ransom or demand they leave their ship so they can overtake and are protected by their security status their operations cannot be performed in highsec however if theyre militia the can perform on their enemy militia still if they shoot or assist in a goodstatus players death they will lose status that protects them  standing the rewards for overtaking a ship is likely to be much more rewarding but equally much less successful requiring a deceptive security status for lowsec and highsec systems nullsec is fair game where even the pirate can be in trouble from anyone this is ultimately more rewarding than being a bandit and reduces the attractiveness of becoming a kill player receive lots of isk notionquotethe banditthey shoot anyone anywhere they are monsters feeding on others anguish pain and leftover booty they turn themselves against the civilized world for their own selfish ways they dont care of security status they maraud militia battles they blockade spacelanes they devour their prey and rise up to their demeanour without remorse they are primitive and do not give a  their operations cannot be performed in highsec their operations can be performed on militia in highsec as a militant however youre also allowing nonmilitia players or even concord to kill your ship their operations can be performed in lowsec however their targets good security status may discourage them the rewards are bitter though sometimes can produce nice results from wreck salvages and sustained cargo contents compared to a pirate they can get equal rewards but certainly no jackpot results like a pirate overtaking freighter full of valuable quantities if not just a ransom

but it is democratic you voted this clown into office precisely because of what he is and what he does and true to himself and you he did not dissapoint his interests are your interests his decisions represent your decisions live with the choices and consequences that you and your candidate madeffs youre all part of the same alliance choose a better less destructive candidate next timeor choose another clown and watch him clown himself out of office again your choice because thats how democracy works
people who voted for mittens will be represented just not by him in the same spirit as the 30k votes that went to people who didnt make it top 14 will be represented too just not by the person they voted for
i think its a good idea ive never done faction warfare myself and ive been quite interested in it just one of the many aspects of the game ive yet to divulge into yet although to think of it it would make things brutally challenging and both sides would have to push harder which is nice glad to see youre still flyin and kickin susan ni4ni says hi
susan i flagged your posts as too awesome for this forumseriously why cant we have something like this i like all of it and it doesnt force anyone into a style they dont like  if you enjoy the gurrila style of fighting then stick with it  the big fights happen regardless already  just play how you want and make any system work for youi personally like these ideas especially the benefits to stations you own and consequences for losing them  another 1

im totally with ccp on revamping the whole game any change on a singular aspect of eves future mustnt be focused on entirely unless of course if it becomes completely unacceptable which i doubt things would becomecrucible has proven something to ccp and theyre continuing that awesomness through the months to next aprils fanfest and beyondfocus on the idea of multiple everything changing and the future of eve will be great not just one thingsandbox is a tricky game to change evidently and they have already exclaimed that this ship balancing is a delicate matter
you do realise that you wont have to retrain anything ccp have repeatedly come out and stated that anything you can fly now you will be able to fly in inferno the rest of your post is just some impotent complaining to add substenance to your core complaint  that you think you have to do more training to fly battlecruisers when you wontalso there appears to be a smattering of butthurt from alphanados mixed in for good measure
show your support keep the dream alive until it becomes a realityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i just found this threadwhy so little support sounds like an awesome idea10000 internetz
im tired of seeing  posts and ideas about how to improve faction warfare so i thought id jump on the bandwagon yeah thats right i said  and i meant it no personal offense to those coming up with the ideas  at least theyre bothering to put the time and effort into them rather than bleating about fw being a steaming pile of used acne cream  but they are  ideasa little background i have been playing this  game for 3 years now the vast majority of which i spent in various militias in fw i have been in them all i even made a blog once but i stopped giving fucks i spent the rest of my time as a  player in nullsec and have a great interest in the political machinations and metagaming of endgame eve though i adamantly deny that i even understand a fraction of whats actually going onso ive come to shine the light of my ideas upon the mouthbreathing denizens of fw in hopes that the merit and testicular fortitude of said ideas will outweigh my hilariously bad reputation and somewhat abrasive and edgy attitudelets begin there are several overarching themes behind the ideas these are essentiallyincentivization  currently there is very little incentive for being in fw and almost no reason to make a career out of it in which to invest your time fw missions went a long way to this end but were merely a stopgap temporary measurerisk vs reward  to counter incentivization there should be some risk im not talking about nullseclevels of risk where you can find all of your space assets and money generation gone over the course of a weekend but currently fw is 100 riskfree pvp and this should changethe fw endgame and metagaming  combining the above two factors in appropriate and interesting ways will make fw far more interesting and i hope promote much deeper player involvement in the end and metagame aspects of fw currently fw has the appeal of a schoolyard  slapfightso that all said here are specific proposals and ideas that i feel will bring fw closer to this end and make the fw experience much more fun in general more pvp in highsec imho being in a militia should above all else mean one thing  you are in a neverending war currently it is far too easy for militia members to simply dock up their shitfit pvp ships in their lowsec staging system and make the one or two jumps to highsec and go bearing for a few weeks or worse an entire subsect of the militia population who have never actually been to lowsec this needs to stop being in the militia should mean you are subject to unwanted violence anywhere at anytime to that end i propose that faction npc military be nerfed beyond recognition first they should take an ungainly amount of time to show up when an enemy militia member arrives in system  upwards of 10 minutes or more if that militia member doesnt shoot anything if the enemy militia member does aggress a member of the militia whose faction owns that system then the faction npcs can show up  but be blatantly weaker than they currently are much of their effectiveness should be relegated to ewar webbing and tping from minmatar neuting and tracking disrupting from amarr etc their response should also depend on what theyre responding to  faction npcs should show up in smaller ships if facing a single enemy militia in an interceptor and larger if theyre in a battleship overall the idea is to make enemy highsec a far more lucrative target but not to the point that it can be exploited so that some dickholes in instacanes can permacamp enemy militia trading hub stations they should have to  off eventually pve plexing to replace  orbiting of  buttons in space for umpteen minutes then rinsing and repeating this is boring unintuitive gameplay get rid of it asap instead require the player to kill off successive waves of rats followed by a single big bad boss who has a chance of dropping awesome loot especially in the bigger plexes also give lp rewards for the killing of these rats or just straightup bounties make people want to plex for reasons other than sovgrinding like it being a quick way for a noob pilot in a destroyer to make a few million to buy a ship this next idea basically rips sansha incursions to make that the primary feature of a fw system changing sovereignty after however many of the above fw plexes are completed a vulnerable system should go into incursion mode with a twist youd have a similar occupancy progress bar appear on the ui with either militia having 50 progress at the getgo the system will fill up with npc faction military incursions each with opposing armadas of faction npcs duking it out in a cool way in order to move the progress bar in their favour militias will have to go into these incursions in fleets and kill all the enemy npcs every completed incursion site brings the system towards their occupancy this should give a pretty hefty lp reward for the militia members doing the fighting as well as the potential to drop some cool stuff the problem here is ensuring that militias benefit the most if not solely from doing these incursions as otherwise it may promote other nonmilitia entities becoming actively involved so lp reward is the best bet the current occupancy bunkers need to go but they need something to replace them fw garrison outposts similar to nullsec outposts these are solely owned by the militia that owns the system it provides a 100 safe harbour for that militia with no neutrals and especially no enemy militia being able to dock the station should provide greatly reduced if not completely free services to the owning militia  free clones free repairs free offices etc
continuing the flipping of a system to enemy occupancy will of course prevent enemy militia from docking and gaining access to their stuff this change should take effect at the next downtime after a system has been flipped this is part of the risk vs reward system they will still have the ability to jump into a clone in the station however and will still be able to contractfiresale their  also its not like they cant just keep it in any of the other normal stations in the system  which will and should not change  if its too important for them to ever lose also i personally think that capital ships should blatantly not be allowed to dock in this station ever for a variety of reasons this next one has already been proposed by ccp and i like it allowing militia members to donate their lp towards building infastructure in a system some of this will be defensive in nature  such as perhaps cyno jammers even if they only affect enemy militia an increase in the number of npc rats spawning in plexes in that system etc otherwise there should be a strong investment component to this such as the ability to spend an outrageous amount of lp to invest in upgrading fw agents in that system seeding npc markets with cool  skillbooks and the few things that are actually left in npc sell orders reducing cost of lp store items providing rd agents bonuses for invention jobs etc etc making fw a profession on both an individualistic and collective corpalliance basis fw should be more lucrative as a profession owning a system should have the potential to bring great wealth benefits to its owners via specific bonuses like aforementioned agent upgrades reducedcost lp stores and so on and the ability to get good payouts from offensive pveing via lp rewards from plexing and doing fw incursions making fw able to generate a sizable stable income will go a long way to providing incentive for players to put the spergeffort into it as you see in nullsec currently there is only one prospect for iskgeneration missionwhoring these missions are dumb and stupid but i am also dumb and stupid and i made lots of money on them a combination of massive lp rewards for missioning lp rewards for plexing lp rewards for system occupancy change incursions and ridiculous taxbreaks and leeway for rd passive isk generation and lowcost invention jobs as well as any other moneymaking endeavours you can throw onto the shitpile will go a long way and that does it i hope you like
so you made lots of money in fw running missions but people need more in order to come to fw do you think that the datacore move assuming that the mechanics of datacore harvesting do not change will bring in lots of people since it is thier passive isk generation devicethe only way i can think of pvp being riskfree is if there were no consequences to the pvp or the income to loss ratio was greatly decreased lost more than you make but as you said under your proposal people can still keep thier stuff 100 safe in normal stations and income generation would be higher where does fw lose its riskfree pvp status with your proposalwould this variety of npc navy be fw specific or would you have all npc navy ships follow this paradigm for example would a 800 sec character not be shot at by the navy when jumping from low to 7 space
having fw generate more isk as a profession will bring more people and hopefully lead to players becoming more invested in those aspects of the game and yes im sure datacore moving to fw will bring peoplethe way it stands now members of fw can never lose all of their assets money or isk generation all they stand to risk is whatever ships they fly into fw fights this is what i mean by riskfree and is in stark contrast to nullsec life where everything you know and love can be taken from you1 bringing the war into highsec will allow enemy militia to prowl the entirety of their space to hunt militia members down wherever they are i can see entire corps dedicated to permanently living in enemy highsec mission and market hubs2 given that owning a system can bring upgrades to lp payouts for activities in that system losing said system should be a punch in the stomach to how much money you can make there such as losing access to datacore generation having lp payouts for mission agents reduced losing lowcost manufacturinginvention capability etc those npcs already are fw specific and differ from the npcs that go after lowsec players

dont be denouncing other ideas this is a sandbox game remember and a human mind capable of pinpointing each causalities is likely to be the most cleverminded probably autistic eve player contributing to a better game for now the general populace probably isnt autistic being allawesome with finding solutions for eves new future so instead i guess they collect multiple standout ideas and make a multitransformer machine out of them ontopicfirst faction warfare could be the esport of eve like how dust 514 gladiator arenas will be the esport of dust with this inmind you set about making this happen whilst still effecting and effected by the sandbox gameincentives is very much something that faction warfare could benefit from free reimbursements of ships with selectable predefined fittings modules for different roles t1 improved militiastandards you do not get advanced ship reimbursements important free incentives must not destabilize the economyrisks you take for being in militia is being a target of enemy militia every second while this may be everso incredibly notso risky by having the game attract pvpers and focusing battlelocations that risk increases the rewards of constant successful battling ought to be some incentive to simply discourage idle militant players from being donothing lamers basically manipulate risk  reward and freebie incentives to focus combat into masses making it an entirely more interesting continuum for everyoneendgame faction warfare isnt really entirely necessary as ideally youd be so captivated by the immediacy of neverending warfare a persistence requiring so much brainpower and teamwork that youd probably forget endgame as youd be enjoying yourself so damn much endgame can happen but i doubt its something urgent maybe a whole empire falling to bits may receive some external support or have been planning a massive resurgence to reclaim their world endgame faction warfare reset fw garrison outpostsquotethe current occupancy bunkers need to go but they need something to replace them fw garrison outposts similar to nullsec outposts these are solely owned by the militia that owns the system it provides a 100 safe harbour for that militia with no neutrals and especially no enemy militia being able to dock the station should provide greatly reduced if not completely free services to the owning militia  free clones free repairs free offices etcfree services for militia this is important to faction warfare and can be merged into the sandbox ccp dislikes trade capitals and so by bringingin an idea of militia effecting local stations would be beautiful if faction warfare was to send a solarsystem or constellation on full alert the alert would enforce a faction warfare tax on every subsequent market order after the tax for militia to receive free services from stations and erect  service garrison outposts that can be overtaken by enemy even an automated npc militia cynosural field that can be exploited by enemy whilst opendoor to an incursion jita 44 would be devastated holy  how cool is this ideacheck me out i got three posts here
yes
bloody well wish they would implement it really with the current fuel costs i can save myself time by just insuring every ship and blowing them up the cost of insurance is the same as the cost of the more popular rigs when destroyed as is the cost of fuel
in order to counter the cloaking abilities of ships could we get a module and possibly new ship that similar to a heavy dictor can deploy a field which decloaks nearby shipsthis would be a good way to balance cloaks and i would be glad if ccp would trade this for giving black ops the ability to warp cloaked
no it wouldntyour presuming that the cloakie is even close enough to youanyone cloakie worth his salt would only need to be within visual rangethat means 75 to 100km or morethe only time one would be on your ass putting it midly is to pop a cyno and even then it wont matter because they intend to do just that caught or not stop the evemail spam
we already have a field like this it has a range of 2500m around every ship
right because gate camps need a buff and the already pregimped cloak ships need another nerf
secondedfwiw compare with many ccp employees keeping their rl names from the public and going by ccp whatever instead at least until they have to give a video interview or fanfest presentationit seems clear ccp groks some of their employees prefer to keep some level of privacy within practical limits so why not extend the same courtesy to csm delegates who may have another primary job and reputation to care about democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard hl mencken
im not against merging it with fi however the new forum lacks even more features for proposal management than the old one did since forever i have been asking for improved forum toolsthe csm expressed that they see ass hall as a legacy tool that isnt needed anymore while i can imagine other systems we have to have something that works and imo fi doesnt fill that role not in its current form going by the csms stance on the issue the only way to get an issue raised is by bugging individual csms essentially doing lobbying work i dont think that is a good way of handling this i much prefer the open democratic and selfdocumenting nature of forum based approaches
my last lengthy post has been eaten and its too late to start again drink the tears troll away whatever thanks eve forums for eating my post try having a fair fight when youve got gcc and people are playing gate and station games there are so many gangs in low sec that only engage whn theyve got gate station aggression on their side if you try to get people to fight away from those they often refuse we all know the corps who just play dock games most of my corp and i are flashy red there is no penalty for shooting us near a station or gate and yet so many gangs just play the yellow box games so they have gate  station guns on their side anyway 3am bedtime good night imaginary tear drinkers and trollers
get more hicsderp derp stop the evemailUFFFDspam
what i see is you losing hauling ships to lowsec denziens including a blockade runner i fail to see how you not knowning how to cloak should result in concord being introduced into lowsecnot every system you want to mission in should be protected by concord lowsec dwellers going on a hauler shooting spree is more effective at dealing with mission botters than ccp at this point
the new ok not so new anymore backgrounds and nebulas look awesome but when cloaked its really hard to see your own ship now please fix so i can see wtf i am pointed atkthnxbye
havent had a problem with this and i spend most of my time in eve cloaked
your post had a purpose until you said kthnxbye now it is pointless drivelyes your cloaked ship is difficult to see not any more difficult just because of the nebula changes i always manage to find my ship when i need to
train reading and comprehension to i before you come back pleaseits quite obvious you dont know how to read or to type stop the evemailUFFFDspam
its sometimes difficult to tell in which direction my ship is heading esp in bright nebulaes would be nice if the cloak would get a predator like effect since its current cloak effect is quite primitivedated
edit nvm wrong threadbut whilst im here i suppose the cloaking affect could use some love although not for the reasons stated above but just because its not a great effect
this wouldnt even be an issue if the csm took the proper position of representing the entire playerbase of eve and not just their constituents the entire constituent point of view proves that the csm is being used as nothing more than a metagaming tool for one large alliance in nullsec if you make it onto the csm you should be taking ideas and points of view from everybody and considering what is best for eve and ccp as a whole and not just what would benefit your alliance the most
these forums need a wtf smiley or not it would probably be the only content in half the posts anyway wtfmad why would i be mad other than field far too many badposters in these forums the goons have never done anything to anger me i rather like some of youwhich is why i suggested you guys shut up and quit pulling this very public hissy fit it eats away at your credibility now instead of fearing you the pubbies are laughing at you ive got no reason to be mad how about youoh and dont let us down on 428 im looking forward to shooting all the gcc ships
sorry welsigeyour gonna have to eat your foot nowyou just got owned stop the evemail spam
the only good idea contained in this thread is having fw agents in space and only because it would make getting missions easier without the need to dock im not sure but it seems youre implying all stations in any particular fw system will be locked off to anyone but the owning militia this is  x1000 it would instantly send thousands of players into homelessness severely  up pretty much every aspect of the game outside empire and doesnt make any logical sensea far more sensible idea would be to replace the current bunker with a special fworiented garrison outpost that only the owning militia can dock in this replaces a stupid worthless piece of  structure with something with viable benefits without causing an uproarous calamity to the thousands of nonfw players who live in lowsec
these suggestions are pretty bad and those that are not are just copies of what ccp announced at fanfest
paying moreless for station services restricting access to fw agents rather than completely losing docking rights seems to be the way to go glad to see there is some consensus on it
i got a different take on this to make whole thing more awesome sandboxstylebio 3
nvmfakeedit susans ideas are pretty much exactly what fw needs it promotes competition between the warring factions while not punishing neutrals for being in the warzone the tiered method gives something with a more grand feeling for fw people to work at while not encouraging nullsec blobwars in lowsec i like it and fausty is just bitter  thus joining test enjoy being a pubby mate

proposal based on this from one older thread with some my editsthere are and anti botting things included make belts so that you must scan them with probes its also antibotting thing  i dont think botts can do probing very well maybe add some more statics on scans too so that you must have brain to see its only static also probing is now in starter profession agents so and noobs must learn to probe things static belts have only very small roids for new noob players strips dont have use if it and they are objects in space so that space is not empty  when you left scanned belt its gone after like 5 minutes you must scan again so that botters cant scan all in the morning and and make bookmarks so that their botts can mine all day long make fleeting with other players and making real ops more rewarding then solo mining orca boost better  botts dont fleet boost rats and make them smarter  maybe give them scram and let them escalate  botts have more problems with defending themself then real people  and it would be more involving make exumers the way that they cant fit active shield boosters but give them more ehp  you have more time to react before rats kill you but you must kill them  no more active tank fits where you dont even pay attention to rats  and mining ships need more ehp overall they are just too easy targets
since they revealed at fanfest that the idea of ring mining is the intended goal in the nearish futurei think it puts this thread in the no longer relevant box

for those carebears out there like me the mission enemies abound part 5 lv4 can be a nightmare and possibly a death sentence especially for amarr flying toons such as myself this mission has a timed spawn and is antifaction vs minmatar republic this means that they npc ships have a very high em thermal and kinetic resistance this missions spawn system is a timed spawn the player has approximately 3  4 minutes before the next wave spawns now the issue here is that the first spawn group deals approximately 815 dps with the following spawns piling on even more dps as they go this means that a player would need a substantial tank to even be able to last long enough to destroy the first spawn witch in my case cant be done in the time frame due to my races damage types due to the high level of dps incoming it is required that the player warps out to avoid destruction however this also means that the player has even less time to dispatch of the npc ships before the next spawn appears and eventually the dps in the room reaches levels that are untankable by any player my proposal is that the spawn system either be changed to an elimination spawn the next spawn is triggered by the destruction of the entire first spawn or that the time between spawns is increased in order to give the mission runner more time to eliminate the npc ships reducing the amount of em thermal and kinetic resistance on the npc ships could also be a possible solutionhope you people support me maybe we can get this changed
perhaps you should have been around when there was no limit to the spawns the only way to make them stop was to pop the stargate as it is i find no issue with it
if a pos was any easier to set up in high sec i wonder how many moons would be left free i am not sure making them easier to set up would actually make them easier to set unless you are one of the first xx00 through the door there are already plenty of systems with often abandoned poss on most or all of their moons at least from my experience trying to find one for another corpon the other hand it would almost give high sec war a purpose fighting over moons
im bumping this thread because ccp is now really getting to work on fw i do not think plexing needs a huge overhaul just a few tweaks once some consequences are added people will start entering the plexes and fighting over them more often and the plexing mechanics are pretty good alreadyit especially does not need to be turned into a system were we shoot red crosses ftwi would also point out that there is a bug where minor plexes will often stop spawning this needs to be fixed the plexes should spawn in a timely fashion because that is what brings some urgency to defending a system make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
the biggest things they can do to help fw plexing is1 build a better ingame militia tab that thing is worthless and offers nothing of value2 update the map a use absolute and not relative value for deciding size of contested dots on maps b refresh map more quickly like every time a plex is closed3 fix respawn bugs get a dev to talk to damar to figure out what is happening and get it fixed
you late a littlebit p
a distinctive sound you make when decloaked that is different from regular decloaking when jumping into system
there isbut its bloody quieti think they kinda nerfed a few patches agomaking it more distinctivewould be nice  stop the evemail spam
id support the audible alarm idea but only when something is actually close enough to be decloaking you not sooner than that
no afk alarm
mehi just wish my ship wouldnt decloak when warping to a belt because it happens to past through the roids
blatant bump
to much fail economics price of rigs is determined byvalue of materials they are made from salvagesurplus of materials for rigs not being used not trashed means they cost lessif people make less then the prices for rigs will still go down maybe even more because less rig manufacturers burning into supply of salvage
get money and buy new rigs
this would be the last thing that we need for cloakies forget all that you ever learned about cloaking grab a bomber and actually fly one through hostile space after you do that for a while and run a few gate camps imagine the nightmare it would be to have to run camps with no cloakcome back to this thread tell everyone that you were wrong and that you feel bad for even thinking this way and was dumb enough to post it up for all to see apologize publicly and biomass yourself oh and before you finish the job give me all your stuffmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
cloaks are an extremely powerful tool in this game they have pretty much 2 purposes 1 to safely hide from an enemy regular cloaks2 to safely navigate through space covert cloakif you negate either of these aspects with a new game mechanic you make the cloak nearly useless as such any decloaking tools need to be balanced such they dont impede the primary role of the cloak your decloak field completely negates covert cloaks  over the balance of covert ops stealth bombers force recons and various t3 configurations you need to think before you post your idea has no drawbacks and essentially negates several classes of ships do you comprehend how bad it is why did you propose it perhaps you can redeem yourself by explaining why you think a mechanic like this needs to exist and what youre trying to accomplish two more points 1 assembly hall is for well thought out ideas brainfarts like this belong in features and ideas 2 ideas exactly like this have been proposed many times before do some research before regurgitating craptastic ideas on the forum
hello everyoni did not find this idea trough the forums in this way tough the general idea is the same to get more tech 2 blueprint originals into the gameso my proposal is based more on playing the game than passive income we all know that there are talks that the current research agent system is going to change in some way and like my self i have trained alot to get the skills to use the agents and i would hate it to go to wastealso i read few threds that the current tech 2 bpo owners control 13 of the tech 2 market thats alotso from these i came up with this idea i will not go into figures cause thats ccps thing and if this idea would be accepted it would be their job to balance it so i will not go into figuresidemaking tech 2 blueprints originals trough hard worthe excisting agent system would be modified so that you can use agents to do the datacores or you could research tech 2 original blueprintsmaking an original would requite minumum of 3 reseach agents combined effortforexample astarte is made by duvolle labs so you would need an agent from that corporation starship engineerin then you would need the 2 other agents mechanical and gallente encryptions that can be can be from any other corporation also you would need the required standings naturaly you can boost the research by adding more agents of the same types up tho maximun of your skillsthe actual research is done with the agents and they will give you missions what you need to do ask for material and so forth if you do not provide the agents with the materials they ask the reseach is halted and is on a stand still they will not ask materials every minute but every now and thenthe print would be done from same material what invention uses and tech 2 blueprint research uses all the materials put into the reseach would be consumedto balance this with invention so that invention would also be viable option this sould take alot of time and effort
complete waste of timeits cheaper to use inventionyour doing it wrong stop the evemail spam
sorry did not read op post
we dont need more t2 bpos if anything just balance invention such that the me and pe levels of the original bpc are transfered to the invented t2 bpc albeit with a penalty for example maybe the invented bpcs me  pe levels retain 05 of the original bpcs mepe levels with different decryptors offering different percentage levels consumable items are much better for this game than static items hence bpcs are much better than bpos
i have used my amazing paint skills to demonstrate how we might make hovering modules a bit more productive currently when you hover a gun module it provides information like which fbutton its assigned to if its on overload or not ammo type and whether or not its active i feel that overload  active status is covered fairly well since when on overheat it is flashing or solid bright green when the module is active you have the green rotating ring i dont have much trouble determining which button its assigned to either and have never once had to hover my module to see which button to pushthat said i present to you my masterpiece of graphic manipulation

pirating is working in eve your supported fine to do it hell you can pirate in highsec as well using game mechanics have a alt in orca supply your ganker with destroyers and blow up exhumers worth hundreds of millionsas to if things are not supported or how to actualy improve things like a black market or a racketering station could you explain what the damnation those are or would be in a player driven game and economy less vague ideas and whine
its a lack of scanning skills or the lack of scanning at all fw low does hold those anomalies
robbing heavily armed warvessel with no loot is piracyhi i wouldnt shoot anyone for few hundred million with current isk value its just not worth of time
ohno another urban legend about long gone pirates in low sec
i havent pirated since 2006 although i tried in 2007 2008 and 2009 but found there was no longer any profitability
this sounds like an overly romanticized view of piracy blowing things up and taking what isnt yours isblowing things up and taking what isnt yours one may be government sanctioned with a letter of marque or one may be part of ones governments regular militaryor one may be flying a jolly roger and yelling yarr at anyone who will listen but not one of these instances will likely make the victim feel less victimizedthis isnt sherwood forestevery capsuleer can be king johnrudeness is the weak mans imitation of strength  eric hoffer
dafuk you talkin aboutthis is also speculating what theyre doing for low sec changesand reasons to how they may be going about thatthis is also suggestions what theyre hearingout foron redefining the middleground that is lowsecthis isnt ignorance this is stimulated discussionand not a typical ragemongering ignorant bullshitgod damn its all good relax and be constructive
yea i can tend to piracy i dont play as it ingame though i had another thought that all this ship revamp and faction warfare revamp could bring about changing lowsec too and not just what this thread is about militia could blast through and while theyre busy fighting they could decide to clear enemy playerpirates of lowsec and claim bounties this is all assuming faction warfare becomes so densely popular
really how so move along trollalso train contribute to the thread or  off to level i before posting again
im sorryi didnt mean to hurt your feelingsif your really that butthurt feel free to go to wow or hello kitty onlinewelcome to eve onlineps maybe you should start with your graphics card settings or brightness because i can see my ship just fine stop the evemailUFFFDspam

dont worry this is largely the casethe csm doesnt dictate what ccp does or doesnt do we explain why players would react the way they would to things that are proposed and while specific groups have specific needs theres people around to push for just about everyone
exactly howi am here trying to discuss an alternative method about replacing candidates for whatever reasons they end not being able to assume the charge being it a punishment getting ill rl issues or any other reasoni am not the one bringing up the especific issue that happened at fanfest while i try to look at the bigger picture some people come and focus on its personal vendettas and rage  wich just serves to prove my point  that players are not being representedwhile i certainly hope that all interests will be represented one must realize candidates will most often than not push for changes that benefit their voters base thats just how reallife works and thus the csm sure they dont hold any real power but their input can sway ccp to one side or the other
given what you want is to be able to apply your 10000 votes to another candidate under the mittanis control it would invalidate removing the mittani from the csm entirelywhen you consider that goons are already cheering about how banning mittani from the game has no effect on his ability to run goonswarm perhaps it would be silly to put himyou in a position to make the same boasts about the csm and its chairmanshipyou guys are your own worst enemies
susan i think that change makes allot more sense so the opposing militia could dock in nonoccupying militia stations without station guns right it would only be the fw specfic stations i think hans had basically proposed this idea beforeif we are happy about how the occupancy mechanics currently work then adding some consequences alon these lines is ok with me personally i think they could be improved but by an large after the down time change they work pretty well i am still curious why you apparently want to increase the importance of pve in faction war occupancy see my earlier post in this thread btw great blog its one of the very few blogs that i actually enjoy reading make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
back to the top  fix the lp stores fix eve 
weve already got t2 faction deadspace and officer tags on icons so why not add an items meta level to the other sidei figure this will be infinitely more convenient than going right click  show info especially if youre wanting to check multiple itemsheres a mockup i worked up i suck at this kind of stuff im sure ccp can do infinitely better i chose the color by randomly flicking the hue shift settingactual sizezoomed in view
i support anything that will stop the prototype limited upgraded everything bullshit that theyre doing add this and restore the original names even though i hate this idea because itll clutter up the nicelooking icons
simple suggestion is handy for all players no drawbacks you have my vote
this sounds fantastic
i like it make it so
youve got my support i hate when im trying to figure out what meta level certain modules are and have to show info a bazillion times like katalci said too then we can have the original names back with all their flavor and charm
names are meaningless dont bother changing them back the new system makes more sense anyway especially to a new player the ops idea is good that part i support
i no longer look at a module and read its name i look at the meta name and see shield recharger meta 4 or whatever this idea makes a lot of sense and would help well everyone
eve has sound the only time this would be useful is if you were afkafkcloakers arent dangerous but they should be probeable in some way perhaps an ultra uber probe launcher and probe
insurance insurance payments would also need to be blocked when a bounty is collected this doesnt seem like such a great leap anymore either now that concord doesnt result in an insurance payment now if only there was a way to track down your mark and force them out of stationpos shields but that would break too many other things
i think this is actually the first good suggestion ive ever seen for bounty hunting the only things id change is that the pod bounty should be capped at the cost of the current clone plus implants and that insurance shouldnt pay for kills where a bounty was collected how would forcing people into npc corps help bounty hunting
how for game mechanics the npc corporation give to you the bh license nothing else the npc bh agents give to you the works nothing else lvl or class system after kills lvl1 10 kills etc and bounties so  u cant kill your pilot with your alt for headprice without works for bh just as the third rule3 class system for headhunting after pirate kill numbers newby bounty hunter cant collect bounty from highly ranked pirates need to reach better bountyhunter class for highly pay 
dps increase needed because titans should always be able to do more dps than anything else in the game i like the idea of titans having to log on to something in system but maybe make it more like a sbu that anchors and onlines at the tcu in 1 minute in low it oils go around the control bunker
i agree that the titans need a damage boost but it should come at a penalty just like the dread why not just let the titan use the siege module instead of outright buffing its damage this would be much easier to implement than your suggestion and would do just about the same thing while also providing a penalty when it does use its massive dpsthis is starting to sound alot like the superdread portion of my proposal
i disagree on the siege titans shouldnt become a tech two dread
rumor has it this is where suggestions should be postedim making a wishlist of trade featureslink to the md forumapparently there is a format i need to follow ill work on thatin short traders havent gotten love in forever please give us love see link for suggestions
advanced cloaking science skill intmem x8requirements cloaking veffects reduces targeting recalibration delay after decloaking on ships with covops cloaks by 1 second per level except on bombers which get 1 second reduction in cloaking reactivation delay per level insteadgoal make cov ops ships better ambushers theres no need for the 56 second targeting delay on covops frigs and recons give a reason to train cloaking v more specialized training for players to do
hmm instalocking arazu with 60km point and 01s targeting delay methinks this could be abused
its bad enough we get cloaky whiners and ers all over hellnow you wana buff the cloaking devicei sense a bad bad omen over this threadnot supportingruns like hell stop the evemail spam
why would that be an issue and say warp bubbles on gates not be an issue you cant see whats on the other side of the gate anymore than you can see a cloaked arazu the bubble instantly stops you warping unless your in a nullified t3 or somethingdrakewhiners will whine regardless theres players that just hate any form of stealth mechanics and players that hate any form of non consensual pvp or even the potential threat of it afk cloak whiners often display characteristics indicating both who cares what they think they dont belong in a game like this to begin with
a bubble is static and doesnt follow you back through the gate while you are attempting to escape bubbles dont stalk you while you are flying through a system cloaked arazus cant be dscanned from a distance and avoided bubbles dont employ debilitating ewar and shoot youedit outside of black ops ships cloakingspecialized ships are more or less balanced as they are imo of course no need to tamper with themnot supported
kills an isk sink not supported what i would support however is making all modules work like rigs in that they are destroyed if removed the only way to get them off the ship once placed on would be for that ship to be destroyed and the module drop as loot or perhaps salvage instead
i realize my idea is not perfect the purpose of this thread was more to toss around some idea to counter them im sorry i was did not really state that earlier now i for one love cloaky ships i fly falcons and stealthbombers i think they are fine as arehoweveri live in a wh with friends and we have noticed the inordinate problems a single sb pilot can have they can site in the hole indefinably with no way to find them and simply wait for the moment when an indy ship such as a hauler is without escort or is otherwise vulnerable even for a momentthis is simply ridiculous one can just sit somewhere with virtually no personally risk for an infinite amount of time i do not personally have a perfect idea for how to solve this problem thats why i brought it here
you mean there is someone that takes his game time to sit and wait like a trapdoorspider waiting for hours until there is someone passing byrespecteasy to counter though make sure youre in a fleet that can come to your aid and make sure your hauler can substain some damage or make the hauler faster and more agile keeping aligned will help as well
try harderits an easy thing to counter stop the evemail spam
i emphasized the important part of your post if you want wh space arguably meant to be the most unsafe place in eve to be safe for a lone hauler youre crazyif you cannot figure out how to counter a ship with literally the worst ehp in the game then a move to high sec might be in order
your decloak bubble wont stop a sb from harassing you in a wh as you cant possibly control the entrances enough to prevent their entering instead you suggest the ideal gate camp device to prevent cloakies from traversing a gate camp for gate camp decloaking try a fast interceptor its harder but you dont deserve easymode decloaking hax as for your rogue sb try a bait ship
would quickly become as mandatory as bubbles themselves and represents extremely easycheap protection from cloakersif anything should be done then treat them like contemporary subs and have subhunters that ping local space for an approximate vector to target  accuracy dependent on type of cloak and range from pinger actual decloaking would still require you to move within the required rangeideally hunting for cloaks should be a teamgroup effort
good lord i know that we need protection on things what im trying to say is its ridiculous someone can just sit cloaked for weeks and we pretty much have nothing we can do to get rid of them i like wormhole space for the danger but one person should not have it this easywe protect haulers or miners ect we have set traps but either he does not engage know we have people cloaked or something or he reclaoks beofer we can lock onto him
whats ridiculous is your statement aboveplease hop in a stealth bomber and go and go try doing this yourself then come back and tell us what a great productive use of your time and effort it was you should also note its only risk free so long as your just sitting watching not doing anything you know kind of like sitting in a pos or a station
so you have already countered the sb thread
definitely not the best idea making the csms real info public
yup supported
i heavily support this but i wouldnt remove the hotkey info both the hotkey info and this information are much more important than how many charges are there considering that is present already when just looking at the module at the risk of making this game too easy these things would save many pilots time and keep us from getting carpal tunnel
i have my volume up and have to go to the escape menu every time i dock to mute sound cause its really loud louder than warp easily can we get a volume slider for station sounds
well i just tried all the systems in the obray constallation and i found no nonfw anomaly using my prober tried obray constallation woenckee constallation lots of gallente stuff but no serpentis port hub den etctried 4 systems not a single serpentis anomaly got plenty of serpentis ded plexes there but no anomalies the ones you can find with the onboard scanner
making pirate scum suffer is a honorable businesscontinue doing so
thiscatching supers with hics is already easytitans should not be able to hit you after the nerfin case of super carriers primary the bombers firstin the event of sub cap agro bring more deeps bro
no point considering all the items are the same anyway if they gave us the ability to customize the stats of the things we made like in beyond protocol or old school swg its a different story
rimase wrote concord operate in lowsec unlike highsecs concord if i ever see you ingame im going to kill you on principlerimase wroteyea i can tend to piracya ridiculous claim considering you want to end itrimase wrotei dont play as it ingame though obviously
great suggestion support this change and as discussion adjusting drop rates for certain tags and reducing negative faction impact of antifaction missions would both help loads as well all three would be total problem solved and the faction lp rewards market would suddenly become functionalsuch a simple change come on ccp
the tags are actually a nice aspect of the lp store the lp stores used to be one of the better self balancing methods of pay for pve in evehowever i think there were 2 hamfisted things that ccp has done to throw this nice system out of whack1 they increased the faction mod drops in null sec which in turn can drive down the prices of the lp store items since they compete2 they gave incursion runners super lp that they can use in any lp store thereby destroying the self balancing aspect of the lp storethe items in the lp store have stayed about the same and maybe rose up in price a bit but the tags have increased in price more than the increase on in the item price hence the profit margins are slimmer the reason the tags have increased in price is the demand for them has gone up due to incursion super lp but the supply has not now the supply of these tags may start to go up from faction war and more people taking these missions but because of the huge amount of super lp incursion farmers have accumulated the lp store will remain a place with very tight margins not only that the tags have a limit as to how high they can reach because of the faction drops in null sec dread guristas shield hardeners keep caldari navy ones from increasing very much and this is what keeps the value of tags low normally what would happen is if the tags go up in price but the items arent going up in price much you could run missions for a different corp but incursion runners get so much direct isk on top of their ultimate lp that they continue to dampen the best lp markets make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve

the titan is a mobile outpost with the abilities to destroy other mobile outpost titans it shouldnt be able to hit a subcap even if said subcap were in the barrel or silo of the titans main weapon moving an xl weapon barrel should be extremly slow otherwise the barrels would bend from inertia and stress due to their immense size shooting a battle ship with a titan should be like shooting a bumble bee at 5 miles with a 120mm cannondreads are made for combat titans are made for support
then how would you implement a damage increase while also providing a risk in using that boosted damage
a titan is not a mobile outpost it is a fleet boosting force projecting superweapon equipped capital weapon combat machine which in my opinion is too much hence the proposal to divide up its capabilities into separate shipsyes i agree it should not be able to hit subcaps but like ive already said ccp is working on a fix for thatas ive already pointed out the titan is not a support ship they are made for combat even more so in fact since they have multiple combat roles that synergize together than dreads do
it isnt but it should be an can in fact be turned into one titans are conceptually incompatible with eve you cant make them a powerful enough combat ship to be worthy of what they are supposed to be without unbalancing the whole game they should never have existed but they do now best approach is to redo them completely in a noncombat role since just deleting them is not a viable option
i read most of your original post and i support the general idea1 selection of multiple orders for cancellation etc modification of the range expiration and quantity of existing ordersoptimize market interface andor ui faster loadingrefreshetca skill to decrease the delay order modification timer fix margin trading scams set threshold for wallet blink option to limit buy orders on sec statusmake it possible to adjust an order within the market window it would also be nice to have your own orders highlighted in the market window just a few of my favorite in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
deployable warp disruptor bubbles cant follow you through a gate but an interdictor or hic can unless just like the arazu theyve already aggressed you cant dscan the other side of a gate and all the debilitating ewar plus so much more can be deployed alongside a deployed warp bubble so as i stated there isnt anything to be abused as mxzf suggested that does not already exist in gate camps so i ask again why are gate camps ok but an arazu with no targeting recalibration after uncloaking not ok
okyou have me thereand admitedly the idea isnt terriblejust might not be favored as far as mechanics are concernedill keep an eye on this thread to see what people say for now  stop the evemail spam
as soon as the hicdic deploys a bubble it becomes aggroed so no it cant follow you through the gate bubbles also do not disable mwds or make you go slower unless a web is applied yes but a mobile bubble needs people otherwise its useless even a solo hic or dic is pretty much useless by itself and can be outrun by almost any ship while using its point save for battleships
same applies to the arazu if it puts a point on someone if its disabling someones mwd it isnt from 40km awaythe arazu needs a person as well and as a force recon isnt exactly a powerful ship alone eitheranyway my key point still stands possibility of suddenly being unable to flee by warping away already exists with gate camps as you cannot see whats at the other side of the gate so that cannot alone be a reason to reject the idea unless your also being consistent and address the gate camp scenario
this seems like a very valid idea do it for the love of god
im sorry i vehemently disagree with your suggestion why do you need to be in different clones for different ctas jump clones have two major benefits 1 they allow you to travel across the universe instantly to a completely different location 2 they allow you to store clones with valuable implants for use later your suggestion while fairly conservative with a 12 hour timer wont solve any of the issues you raised your primary reason for wanting a reduced jc timer is so people can join multiple ctas within the same day using different implant sets here are the some major flaws in your reasoning for the change a implants dont hurt you as such you never need to switch implants for a gang the implants you have might cost more than you wish to risk and there are often better implants you could use but you dont need them there are two cases i foresee where you can claim im wrong here fitting implants and mindlinks this brings me to point b b you can already use different implant sets without waiting for the 24 hour timer you find the implant under augmentations right click and hit unplug then plug in new ones sure you might not want to do so with a billion isk pirate set but the inconvenience of implants is the only drawback they have most implants do not cost an exuberant amount of isk and if you cant afford to unplug and plug in new ones youre either flying with too expensive implants or youre too cheap eve is a game of consequences and the consequences for using expensive implants is you cant stop usingrisking them until they get stored in a jc that is the price of using implants why should this be reducedc if you have multiple ctas to attend do you really think a 12 hour timer on your clone is going to solve anything most players dont play enough to attend ctas 12 hours apart essentially what your asking for is the ability to jc out of your clone at at the end of the day and clone hop back at log in this way you can maximize your training without risking expensive implants etc etc etc if you want to have your implant sets for modern day ctas you would need a jc on the order of 24 hours but then why would anyone fly anywhere as they could jc all over the known universeessentially i understand your desire to be able to jc more often but you havent given any reason worth a damn the results of your suggestion would have the follwoing effects  reduce the oppertunity cost of implants part of the cost of having an implant is that you cant unfit it by making jcing between clones easier you are effectively reducing the impact his will have on your character  remove the importance of location by reducing the jc timer you basically encourage jcing as a mode of travel while it is currently used as one the 24 hour timer limits its effectiveness there is also suicide med bay traveling but the destinations you can reach are far more limited and the cost is signficantly greater than with jcs
why do you need to jc between regions you can just as easily set your med clone to the new destination undock and suicide your pod sure you dont get to keep your implants and it costs you some isk to upgrade your clone but do you really think its good for the game if you can move around the entire universe without some type of risk andor cost
well if you think this way then it would be better to remove tech one print alsoUFFFDan idea about generating more items to the game should be considered they would be player made everything else in the game is also player made so this way you could start to produce something you would like to have tough it would consume alot of time and effort it would be something for those that like to do research not everyone likes to shoot things up you know
t2 bpos were removed for a reason i suggest you find out that that reason is before deciding to undo italso those t2 bpo holders for the most part are still trying to break even on the cost of actually getting it last i heard it took at least 5 years before you actually hit the break even point
well ccp can you tell us why did you remove tech 2 blueprint original lotteryand so what if someone is breaking even after 5 years the game is changed constantly and when ccp was seeding t2 originals they did not cost anything you got the originals trough a lottery system a loong loong time ago thus the current system is faulty where we have a fixed amount of originals and copies with horrible me levels and competing with the originals is nearly impossibleand thats why i had idea was to make a new system where people would need to work towards getting bpos and not just randomly get them trough a lottery this would also add new content to the game for the players that do like carebearing and stuff and also im not saying they should remove the invention system but they should make a system next to it where you could get originals as a rewardoh here
i understand youUFFFDre trying to balance manufacturing however i just donUFFFDt think this is the right way to do it truth be told there are several reasons t2 manufacturing has such a low profit margin t2 bpo holders always take the ire as they can always produce items using fewer materials but there are other ways that t2 markets have been cornered many people have cheap sources of moongoo materials which is why they can produce items far more cheaply than the random indy corp other people have very cheap sources of mineralsUFFFD these are just as important at creating highly profitable t2 items as the t2 bpos and moreso in many cases here is the major problem with your suggestion you crash the t2 bpo market while you feel like t2 bpos give an unfair advantage to those with them we are no longer in the environment were people came upon their t2 bpos by chance it has been five years since the lottery ended and the majority of holders have them as investments your suggestion doesnt slap the face of some lucky veterans rather it castrates the industrious players that have spent years accruing their massive wealth your belief that most players that have t2 bpoUFFFDs do so because they won them in a lottery is just plain wrong most players that have t2 bpoUFFFDs do so because they built a financial empire and bought them with their hardearned isk these are the players youUFFFDre  over and frankly they donUFFFDt deserve it if you bothered to examine my counter idea youUFFFDd see that it helps balance the mepe discrepencies between inventors and bpo holders yet the bpo holder still retains a significant advantage and hence value it gives a major boost to exploration and it rewards people for taking the time to get high mepe levels on their t1 bpoUFFFDs which straight up boosts pos research your suggestion adds very little to the economy relies on interacting with annoying npc agents and is very short sighted in whom it hurtsUFFFD
i do not see it as a problem if the tech 2 bpo market would crash it realy isnt real market cause the prices are stupidly insanetough if the bpo idea is silly im open for discustion i just feel something needs to be done to inventionmayby make copies researchable
i know countless t2 invetorsand everyone of them tells me t2 bpos  waste of timewhat the heck is driving this stop the evemail spam
thats like saying the diamond market isnt a real market because the prices are stupidly insane just because a market has a high barrier of entry doesnt mean that its not a real market or isnt validadditionally if you had read the link you looked up you would see that they wanted it player driven not something you can get out of an npc you are aware they are taking as much away from npcs as they can right if ccp could figure out how to do it they would remove t1 bpos as well since those and skillbooks are just about the only things that are sold by npcs on the marketnext you are going to want faction bpos in the lp stores
i completely agree with thisyes i know people will say but you have to trust everyone and blah blah blah but if that was the case then why have any security roles at all it is just beyond crazy that just because someone can run some factory slots that they can cancel every single job ran by every single player in the coporation it is just beyond crazy i just cant understand why this hasnt been fixed yethas ccp every repsonded to this issue i have searched around but havent been able to find any ccp resonse to this issue at all it would be nice to know what their stance on it was
yes this one of the many issues in the morass of corp management that needs to be dealt with i really cant wait for the time when they completely overhaul corp management wistful sigh
what would one need to do to get an official respnse on this you would be surprised what i would do to get said response this one issue is probobly the only thing really keeping me from really getting into this gameif anyone anywhere has ever seen any official response on this issue please post a link i would be your friend forever
iirc the best way is supposed to be to get in touch with the csm i keep meaning to do that about one of my threads but i just havent gotten around to it lol
my understaning though is that the csm has people who really dont care about this sort of stuff they are more into the bang bang zap zap features of the game which is cool and all but really i just dont know why this hasnt been fixed yet it makes my head hurt thinking about it
so whilst i was looking to help a friend who was trying to get involved in faction warfare i came across a problemwhen you do a search with the faction warfare tag selected in the recruitment search it returns a whole slew of results and very few of them actually have anything to do with actual faction warfare i propose that the faction warfare tag can only be used in corps that are actually a part of fw
i will argue that this would also add an element of distraction for female players when shooting people in the face becomes a reality in wis but in all seriousness this is purely for that bit of added immersion in the game
i am happy that they posed the question at fanfest and ccp responded favorably in that they want gang links on grid as well i cant wait to start popping me some command ships
i missed this wherewhen did this come upit seems ccp is reading what the players want i am glad to hear it make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i dont remember which panel it was on but during the qa someone asked if ccp ever intended on making fleet boosters be on grid i believe it was torfifrans that answered and stated that they did want fleet boosters to be part of the fight and on grid i will see if i can find a link
just a small idea to thiscause this is based on killrights so as some people know someone will want to add bounties to people with no killrights on them so how about if you could buy killright and add you bounty to it from concordbuying more killrights against the same player would be more costly like 2 times more every time and yes this should be insane expensive to players like 500mil  killright for the first one plus bounty this would be for those that you realy realy hate someone and want them to suffer for their deedsjust an ideathe high and increased cost would limit griefing and so onbut i still like the base idea anyways xd
500 mill isnt nearly enough  people will pay that in a heartbeat to be able to get killrights on a jump freighter pilot for instance its just too open to exploitation imo
i agree dont make it more complex than it has to be just make killrights transferable via contracts that dont payout more than the cost of the kill
completely no killrights are issued on a chracter and granted to another they may be grantedtransferred to different characters but under no circumstance they could be issued to people who didnt calle don themsevles with their unlawful actionsbounty hunting is a utterly useless and broken retaliation system not another venue for free griefing as if eve needed any more of those
thank you for both of your suggestions and support  i really do wish ccp would look at tag distribution and give it some more love 
little chevrons for the metalevelits a tiny effort much easier then the whole renaming nonsense with ccp gnauton butchering module names seriously that guy has absolutely no clue what hes doingoperation write down all the things check out the list at
dear ccpthank you for letting us create our own playlists in the ingame jukebox its a nice feature and i really love doing missions to the soundtrack of the firefly series etc but why oh why does the player have to switch to the ingame action music every time you pass through an acceleration gate it completely counters the idea behind having your own playlist if every time you pass through a mission gate you are reverted to the clients own musici know this is a small thing but that also means its easy to fix two simple solutions come to mind when going through an acceleration gate client does a check to see if youre playing normal eve playlist or if you are playing custom playlist if the latter client doesnt load mission music a checkbox in the escape menu that allows you to select whether you wish to have mission action music or not thanksyargle
but u can limit the amount of ingame titans then u can make them very powerful without breaking the game
who get to keep their titans are you suggesting ccp take titans away from anyone who has to many how exactly would you propose to do this with out creating a potential situation where one side has an overwhelming number of titansif you limit it to say 10 at least 7 of those 10 will end up joining the same alliance because titans are much safer with other titans around do you understand why this would be a problem
they should be support ships as long as its a combat ship we will continue to see fleets with dozens of titanstitans should be mobile stations with full docking logging onoff capability for docked players upgradable stationservices and corporationowned and operated in the same way pos aretheir role should be forward commandposts for big sovalliances and mobile hqs for more nomadic smaller alliancesoperation write down all the things check out the list at
with as many roles as titans currently have you are correct that they unbalance the whole game however if we were to cut down on the number of roles they were able to perform in they become much easier to balance properly while still being appropriately powerfulall of the methods of limiting titans i have seen thus far are unsatisfactory to downright terrible from a coding standpoint an adjustment of the superweapon and the roles a titan can perform would be a much easier fixi dont see a problem with large fleets of titans the problem i see is that said fleets of titans have no counter and thats what needs to be fixed they are currently far too capable and fitting them into a more focused role seems to be the easiest and simplest method of fixing it that i have seeni kind of agree that you should be able to dock subcaps in a titan but not capitals you should not be able to log out while docked in a titan and i dont see any purpose for station services in a titan other than perhaps a repair bay titans should not be associated with a pos in any way shape or form imo if you want a station build a station you can buy 4 of them for the price of a titan
limit titan pilots can only join corps that are in alliances and these corps can only have one player with one of the titan skill books injected in corp a alliance could only have one tiatn capable corp at a time all exsisting titans would be kept however it you owned a titan u would be forced to drop corp
yet another terrible idea what about corps with 15 people with titan skillbooks injected even if none of them have the ship to go with it are you going to force them to not be able to play togetheredit corps that build titans need several people capable of flying them and will also need at least 1 of each skillbook so your limit on titan skillbooks would need to be at least 10 or more per corp
eve is a pvp game period whoever does not pvp doesnt know how to play eve right instead of wasting time money and tears about how to fix wardec incursions etc and to be sure empire carebears do not earn more isk than peeveepeers i propose to turn safe empire to 00 or better to low sec edit empire as we know it now should be only for npc corps the moment you leave the npc corp you leave empireps be nice
obvious troll is obvious 010
its called a proposal it says get rid of empire entirely
this proposal will go far
i hope so because it would solve such problems entirely

thanks for your anwer first of i dont force nothing i think i have the right to make a proposal if its accepted or not thats a different story now
reread your proposal and tell me again your not forcing people to play to your so called imposed stylealsoccp has not really changed much at all the current mechancis for dodging war dec is still the same it waswhats changing however is the exploits currently availablethat is the differenceso pleasewith all due respectget off your pvp highhorse and come back down to reallity eh stop the evemail spam
lets add this to the flux system security due to piratemissioner activity take a few months of ratting and ganking blob and plexing statistics and transform every system with x number of rats killed into a higher sec system and every system with a x number of player killed ships into a lower security system vast swaths of null would become a hi security and parts of empire would become lowsec jita would of course become nullsec in a day as no missions happen there and they dont have belts to rat this would be very very entertaining mission hubs would remain little outposts in otherwise low security space concord sov would stay hisec because its concord sov space it would still be empire sov so no jb or ihubs but you would have to actively defend your research towers as the wardecs would fly for those hisec moon spaces and reaction towers would need you to really defend your space lest it turn back into hisec and all your stuff get unanchored this would in turn really entice people to move out to alliance hicesec and revive those regional market hubs unless someone really took the time and effort to maintain those trade route corridors to jita they would all fall pretty fast into lowsecurity and nullsec
unsupported cloaking is already too overpowered
gonna have to go with the crowd and say no to this one cloaking needs to be balanced out properly before any more crap is added to it
yeah this was easily the best bounty hunter fix i had seen on the forums i had an idea that was similar but this was a hell of a lot more refined and in my opinion pretty much solves the entire problem
doh
the reasons are billions of isk maybe my money is not worth a damn to you but i feel quite differently about my money pali can understand being opposed to something because it risks a small amount but you want to throw billions of my isk down the drain like its nothing well if throwing away large sums of my money is just fine with you then i probably dont need to tell you what i think of you and your opinion do i what a jerk
rule 1 of eve dont fly what you cant afford to lose and that goes for implants as wellif youre balking because youre too scared of losing your head of billion isk worth of implants then perhaps you should stick to cheaper ones i really dislike the idea of people using jump clones to simply keep their precious implants safe all the time whenever they like to roam in lowsec instead of say riskfree rvb brawling ill say it again though with titanbridges jumpbridges warpto0 warpspeed rigs jf plenty of remaining highway gates eve is like a global village where everyone in empire can shop in jita in less then half an hour and nullblobs can easily gather the population of half a dozen regions at once and it doesnt take too much effort for capital blobs to travel to the other side of the map and back in a single eveningjjumpclones are only a part of this problem but slashing their timers inhalf is certainly a huge step in the wrong directionoperation write down all the things check out the list at

well ok lets refrace abit what i said the market is not stupid and i know some a small portion make their living out from it but its getting old it needs a change plus i want more content into the game like pvp players want new ships i just want more industrial contentand what bad is there in static items someone has them and someone dont its all about balancing anywaysthe idea is to increase player content in the game and why not faction bpos also as an idustrialist i would love to have one it would make my life easier when i dont need to pay insane amounts if isks to alliances to get something i want to doand also the dev blog also said looking forward perhaps the solution is simply stopping this original work and allowing reserarching of the copies from invention to make the them efficient after the invention process perhaps reverse engineering should be the mechanism to allow you to further increase the runs of an invented copy at the cost of less efficiency you can think that also as lets make bpcs researchable and that would also crash the tech 2 bpo market you seem so keen to keep
contradictions are bad mkay stop the evemail spam
static items are bad because i cant take them from you in eve bpos are about the only thing other than sp that you cannot lose to anything other than gross stupidity if you lose a t2 bpo you are a moron for the same reason people getting blown up with plex in their holds are morons and people who dont keep up to date clones are moronsdid you know you can affect the me pe and runs on a bpc produced by invention look at what decryptors do beyond changing the chance of successbut i really see no significant balance issues with letting the stats of the bpc you are inventing from change the stats of the t2 bpc you are inventing its a shame that no one has every suggested that before
not this thread againthe assumption is wrongfor all but a few items demand is far greater than what could be supplied by bpos therefore the market is perfectly able to balance based on invention supply vs demandintroducing new t2 bpos is out of the questionimproving the me of invention bpcs would screw over bpo owners because of the reduced margins they wouldnt be able to brake even in their lifetime instead of 58 years as is currently commontherefore the best solution is to leave the the system as it is slowly t2 bpos are removed by more or less natural means anyway they explode accounts get inactive or banned
its not just wrong its an outright lie there was a qen once that showed that 97 of all t2 jobs were invention basedt2 bpo whiners like to ignore that and instead pretend that items like t2 armor plates are representative of the whole market
wrapping duct tape around my headahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
so they still doing temp bans for botting or they changing that i dont see anything wrong with a temp ban than full ban on 2nd offence
no rmt is murderbotting is just speeding excessivelyanyway nothing wrong with a temp ban first as most banned botters stop and sometimes innocents do get hit personally see no need for a 3rd chance
i and some others have mentioned how a hullcost based payout could work really well i wrote an autistically long post about this a couple years ago the tldr because it really is too long is that lowsec is actually a failed ecosystem and on its own increasing rewards will never work without introducing another predator species and the way to do that is to include this kind of a bounty systemits been a while since ive thought about this and i doubt i agree with everything i wrote in that post i know one issue ive thought of since then is that with this system there is very little impetus to add a bounty to someone if they already have one that is substantially high enough but i dont know if there is a way around that or if its even a problemtheres also a part of me that wonders if the bounties couldnt be placed on the corporation as a whole instead of just on the pilotsedit rereading my original post i just noticed that it got necroed 3 months after i originally posted it and continued on without me knowing thats kind of neat

during my time in the corporation dark shadow industries who managed a very healthy balance between pvp and industry ie building capital ships one of our directors created a corp exclusive website that managed capital ship building projects essentially it worked out how much ore of varying types was required to build a certain ship and you could add the ore you mined to that project and the required ore would then go down it would keep track of what each person had contributed to the project so that when the ship was sold your contribution could be calculated very easily and the isk could be paid to you with little to no hassle having since run a corporation and tried to do a similar thing without the website i can tell you itUFFFDs pretty much impossible well its possible just incredibly time consuming keeping track of who mined what is difficult so i propose the following two changes1 that fleet logs should have options for sorting the information by player by ore etc this will mean that at the end of mining operations orca pilots will be able to see what each person has contributed that dayop and pay them accordingly2 that a new contract type called industrial projects be created that allows people to add ore they have mined to a project to start a project you would require a blueprint which would calculate the required ore based on the project starters refine skills and the station standings of the station that the project was created in as well as the blueprint stats what everyone had added to the project would be visible on the contract and you could see how close the the project was to having the ore required to build the item the ore when added to the project would be added to a corp hangar in the corp office of the contract owner a corp office or a pos would be a requirement to creating an industrial projectthis is a loose idea and obviously may require some changes or adjustmentsplease throw your support or criticisms my way if you like the idea i have also posted it up in the features and ideas discussion please show your support there as well

drake drake 1 this is an alt 2 i am at your side you just do not notice it read again what i wrote ok englsh not my favorite but still some arguments would be nice thanks
there is no argumenteve has a wide variety of play styles many many people enjoy the relative safety of highsec i myself often use my alt to make isk in highsec to fund my nullsec antics he runs a small corp filled with new players that has rarely had problems with war you will have thousands of nonpvping players and many of the pvping players unsubscribing almost instantly the relative safety afforded in highsec is where 90 estimated of t1 production occurs if you think prices for ships is high now just imagine what it would be like with no safe place for miners just imagine jita for a moment it would be bloody horrible chaos war decs dont even come into it they are such a small part of eve compared to the vastness of high security space new players would die instantly on undocking or best case scenario at the exit stargate some players will never ever pvp and you will take that choice from them they wont want to play anymore and its those carebears that fuel most of the economy and provide the ships for us to blow each other up in if i wrote out everything that was wrong with your suggestion it would take me days to write it all outi cant believe you couldnt think of these things yourselfit is beyond my ability to even imagine how another human being intelligent enough to type can think this is a good ideain the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

hellowould like to offer the idea to make it possible to find permacloaker in a systempeople login fly on a safespot and take look every few hourshe had a hugh bonus but the systemuser have no way to find himwhats about a effect when the ship stands for about 30 minutes cloaked at the same pointsome interferences may be found when a ship is cloaked so long at the same pointcombat scanner probes may find a signature after a time and you have the chance to warp to the cloaky and decloak himthis will reduce the amount of afk cloaker in a system and may reduce it to pilots that really want to get a kill or pilots that chance the position every xy minute
yes because reposting the same idea every day is going to work stop the evemail spam
if they are cloaked they cant shoot you
how does this come up so often cloaks are fine
just gonna throw an idea out there if youre worried about cloakies in a system then secure your system better have more combat ships ready to warp at any second bubble gates and drop random items that will decloak a ship and have people watch
little overpowered i think the victim needs a chance to react and escape for simple balance reasons that said cutting the time by 05s per lvl would be reasonable it would still keep a 2 second delay on top of the already lowish scan res of recons
thanks for your commentsi still find it curious that a number of you view this as over powered but somehow existing mechanics of gatecamps is considered ok unless some of you actually do also think gate mechanics should be changed so that players always have a chance to escape when they jump into a system
i want advanced decloaking ship and skills against the afk cloakers
i believe there is a general sentiment around eve that moon mining in its current state is unbalanced im not going to go into details about it  that can be discussed in separate threads instead i would like to propose a change to how moon mining worksthe proposal is simple as the moon goo is mined it accumulates at the poco at the moon it is then shipped to the pos at regular intervals lets say every 6 hours the shipping can be done via npc haulersfreighterscontainersetc similar to the ones near high sec stations during this phase the moon goo is vulnerable to be intercepted a hostile fleet will be able to scan it down and attack the cargo ships once the ship reaches armor it goes into rf mode with a 30 minute timer after the timer is up the hostiles can destroy the ship and claim the loot for themselves the cargo ship should have enough ehp for a small 5 man gang to be able to rf it in 10 minutes or a 10 man gang in 5 minuteswhat would be the impact of this changefirst of all moon goo is no longer free money it will become something that can be potentially stolen by small gangs the rf timer is to give the defender an opportunity to come in and save the cargo after it has been attackedthis will also give some strategic purpose for roaming into hostile space imagine a raiding party going into a whole region and stealing all the moon goo the owners of the moons will have financial incentive to form up defense fleets and chase the raiders out of their space it also creates flash points for small fights  when each of the timers runs outi believe this favors small gangs over large blobs the targets are small enough that 510 man fleets can take them out with relative ease bringing in large blobs to attackdefend does not make a lot of sense since the drops are relatively small lets say a pos mines 240m iskday each cargo shipment will be worth 60m a small gang can sweep through a constellation attack all the moon goo haulers and make a reasonable amount of isk doing it with larger fleets you get diminishing returns and it is no longer worth iton the defensive side this will make large alliances work for their passive income a small alliance should be able to defend their space pretty well  everything will be near by large alliances that are spread out and deployed else where will become targets for raidersthoughts
its a very interesting proposal i wont lie i like ithowever i think it would take a very large amount of ccp resources when a much simpler solution to the moon goo problem could be foundin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
thats the point of jcs so you dont have to fly with implants you dont want to lose no you should use a jc that doesnt have implants
omg psichotic you come across as obnoxiously entitled just because you spend billions of isk on something doesnt mean you should be able to store it safely away the moment youre done using it what are the benefits of a billion isk worth of implants 50 betters shield boosts or 50 more armor or 25 more speed or 450 more sphr these are game changing boosts especially when coupled with fleet boosters and drugs so what are there drawbacks to using implants  lets list the drawbacks of your biillions in implants 1 you lose them if you get podded or unplug them hmm thats not exactly a drawback it just means that like everything else in eve you can losing them 2 you cant plug them all in so if you have to chose between them omg pirate implants interfere with 5 learning implants i hardly call this a drawback but i listed it anyway because someone will certainly view this as the loss of one boost to gain another boost that isnt a drawback of the implants its a drawback of your choices 3 so what other drawback are there uhm uuhhh maybe uhh hmmmm oh thats right there are no drawbacks to using them none none what so ever so these things dont have any drawbacks and yet give game changing boosts so what if it costs you a lot of isk to get them the effort andor rarity which causes their price tag is the only thing preventing all of eve from using them so you have a clone implanted with game changing implants that have no drawbacks and youre complaining because you have to wait 24 hours before you can safely store them in a jump clone really i mean really if you want the awesome benefits they offer then you have to risk losing them and yes you should have to deal with risk of losing them for more than the 2 hours of a cta during which your alliance blobs out the sun worrying about your clone for up to 24 hours is a small price to pay for the awesome benefits those implants provide you do not need them for a cta certainly not pirate sets what your thread comes down to is fly what you can afford dont fly what you cant afford  and guess what this doesnt refer solely to isk but to your time as well
rigs are in no sense an isk sink an isk sink is something like taxes or npc sell orders where isk is actually removed from game rig destruction and ship destruction do not remove any isk from the game in any way
this would be nice more options more variety and for those that are into such activity a chance for a nice fully assembled 6 billion isk mission ship to drop when they ganked the carrying ship
i think ccp should introduce a racial transport ship that is tooled towards moving assembled ships perhaps a small bssized industrial with about 150k to 200k m3 hangar space for explorers and wh people that like to live out of a suitcase and a larger orcasized one with about 500k to 750k m3 hangar for frontline reshipping and bulk transportationboth with a good tank and enough defenses to handle some tacklersadded to this ccp should remove the lead plates around the corp and ship hangars in ships that disable scanning and make it so the contents show up on the killmail and the insurance isnt voided when transported ships blow upoperation write down all the things check out the list at
supported 10023h gives some flexibility without actually changing the spirit of the mechanic at all
id even be happy with 23 hours 30 mins just give us some fllexibility to jump daily without the inevitable creep forward
actually i think ichn has a very good idea if they increased the jc timer as he suggested people would quit using it for everyday bouncing leave it as an every other day thing
really why do we need to jc every day what you cant be asked to fly in a flying in space game jcs are one of the reasons eve is sooo small i hardly think you need to encourage more jcing if anything quite the opposite
i like that idea though to really justify having it as a new module as opposed to using the curret day smartbombs it would have to have some other kind of attributes like no damage longer cycle time and increase range for example
or decloaking bomb with 30km area effect

hi csm dudesi came up with an idea and have posted it the ideas forum but some one said i should post it here to so here it is
we need a two tier forum before you can bring something to a vote something on assembly hall should be a well thought through idea that has taken a battering gone through refinement and iteration and taken account of objections in fiyou shouldnt be allowed to post a new topic in ah unless you can link a discussional thread in fi that shows at last a reasonable degree of support
so ecactly in which expansion will fw improvement be implmented it seems ccp keeps saying the next expansion but it doesnt happen 
they said fw upgrade will come with inferno expansion
i dont think anyone here would say that they want wh space to stay the same no matter what but what was suggested and agreed with by these members of the csm was purely self interest or ignorance of the mechanics either way the ignorant should of just stayed out of what they didnt understand all that well mittens and the selfish meissa should of just shut the  up and kept his agenda in game and not on the table of the csm
i havent read the whole thread responding to op i read your proposal and i find that you underestimate the abilityof pilots to be stubborn if i go by your system i will buy the contract and contact perp we will split the profits as ipop him in his noob ship 1000x to collect the bounty so i gotta grind a little to get all the cash the system oftying what the hunted flies and has in his head goes down the drain
pretty much the whole proposal  and the following thread  is about trying to make your doing this as difficult as possible and me defending the consequent complexity on this basisi dont think theres any way to make it completely impossible to do that but i have tried to make it so that youll need to put in some real effort to do so youd need to join or get an alt into the bounty corp that gets the contract or else get ve standings to the guy issuing the contract that means that you or your alt would need some kind of working relationship with other players either exactly the right bounty corp or you managed to infiltrate the guys you ganked to achieve the result youre after if youve been foresighted or socially skilled enough to achieve this then i think that you will have earned your right to spend your some of your time and isk scraping off the bounty placed upon you
if this system has been broken or not working as intended for years then why hasnt the past or present csms or even ccp done anything about it i agree with op lets just put this to the front pile lets get this pushed through
if i recall correctly every single csm has asked ccp to rework the bounty systemccps answer when they troubled to give one has been that the tangled and undocumented state of crimewatch eves standings and aggression management system basically made it an impossible job per this years fanfest presentation ccp are finally reworking crimewatch which gives us an opportunity to get some kind of bounty hunting system introduced that isnt merely a cruel joke on the new and ignorant player
this anything else is unnecessarily restrictive the proposal linked below is better and simpler
so youre ok with me spending 50 mill isk to negate a 500 mill bounty i personally would be pretty reluctant to place a bounty on anyone on those terms
skill reading and comprehension to level 1 once you have skilled that up read the link i postedthis thread is a terrible idea killrights as a necessity would make bounties almost as useless as they are now seeing as you cant read properly allow me to explain in moron terms percentage of damage done in isk minus insurance would be payed to the killer and deducted not negating from the persons total bounty if your hypothetical person with with 500m bounty was killed and the killer received 50m isk their new bounty would be 450m give up on this ridiculous idea and start supporting the other bounty thread the one that has been written and rewritten over and over and always gets lots and lots of support linked below for emphasis
supportedif they really want simplicity they could do enhanced item name grade x x being meta level for the itemsa icon would be even better than any name change being that you could quickly see it without going through a name or a click info
supported with emphasis paying people per amount of time for mining is daft and this seems like a pretty good solution the corporation i run does or has done a great deal of mining and manufacturing trying to mine as a team is difficult to balance and largely a waste of timeas i see it there are currently a few ways of running mining ops all of which are inadequate paying miners per amount of time mining more skilled players people who are afk less and with better ships are penalized creating everyone ships and not handing them out until everyones ship is created  people who contribute less benefit more dividing up how much everyone mined and paying them for the ore currently immensely time consuming and difficultcorp members largely contribute to corp projects out of charity in the current available systems it would be nice to be able to measure their input and actually pay them like a real spaceship corporation would

my suggestion would be to think of very lightweight ways that the client could help support 3rdparty tools that would implement the features you want the simpler and easier it is for ccp to implement and the more possible uses it supports then the more likely it is you will get something implemented that you can usefor example  and this is just off the top of my head client logs of stuff you move and stuff that is moved into your ship you could then process the log file to generate the report you want drag and drop integration with the ingame browser so someone could drag something into a cha then drag it from there onto your web app and the app would get told person x dragged y from location z or something
the way i see things in corporations is theyre motivated by all members working the corporation wallet in order to claim credit from their shares valueor have corporate contracts set upprojects are like a partitioned agenda and when a corporation has a solid agenda comes about tasks for members by using a system of contracts a type of project will detail to the manager the contribution compositions required to fulfil the project management of projects then have to decide those conditions values calculate payment and watch them be fulfilled within selected timenot only that it encourages cohesion even further within a corporation this is greatto make things less complicated these projects would be isk rewards only external corporate project contracts would be publicshared contracts like an employment vacancy that cannot be excepted by internal corporation members a single person or fleet or even a whole other corporation could accept the contract and fulfil it risks exposure of corps strategies internal corporate project contracts would be shared contracts where the most contributory capsuleers receive highest partition of the reward private corporate project contracts would be assigned to one or multiple corporation members shared yet limited to those selected characterstypes of corporation business contracts isk rewards only relations measured by corporate standings earned of targetnpcorp to targetvaluecondition private contract minimum contractees  production a blueprint bill of materials autobuilds upon completing contractprefix blueprint runs  contractor predefines the material quantities reserves selected quantity of selected materials or any items to be met security a recurrent daily contract  selected solarsystems are purged of hostile npcs standingsbased targets singular  collective targetsedits contract subject to changes  cancellations wont negatively impact your contract history logistics multiple items from one stations corporate hanger transported to another stations corporate hanger trade items fromto corporate hanger soldbought and crediteddebited into corporate walletbonus efficiency of trade grants an increased partitionedreward isk valuepartitioned reward corporation projectbusiness contracts only partitioned rewards means involved parties receive a percentage of the contracts rewards based on their level of contributionwith the introduction of new contracts coming in the future why not have some more businessfocused contracts

only thing that could happen is faction warfare the metagame of eve becoming a true friendly esport working with dust 514this friendly metagame of empire sovereign wars would differentiate from corporate business warsthe ideal eve metagame may be an alternative fun and friendly balanced and controlled genre with a relentless constancy and tactical advantages of advanced equipment that debalancing because of their superiority above standardised equipment  sandboxs influence of winning battles and wars disattached from sandbox yet still mildly connectedi like trader stuff in eve and so this thread sucks
thank you for your raisoning i like your post very much in fact that are similar thoughts of mine and therefor i made this proposal because my proposal is what is gonna be when inferno kicks in inferno with its war agenda etc turns empire into 00low sec just for a few corps and a few pilots the question is should it apply for only a few corporations or should it apply for all corporations and since inferno is comming me thinks that the 2nd case should be applyied  for all corporationswhy should it be possible to grief only certain corps inferno turns empire to a griefing and harrasing environment for those carebearers same environment and same rules for everybody therefore instead of empire  00 with inferno how many new players gonna unsubscribe if they have to a sit in station b abandon assets poses and go back to npc corps cpay tons of isk for either be able to surrender if acceted or geting mercs to fight for them and d fight backif we want to keep war ongoing in empire than it would be better to turn empire into 00 equal rules and environment for all

yeah and pay playre for being 24h around just waiting for a cloaky the part that cloakys have such hugh bonus is something special what other tactic or typ of ship has a so big advantagepermacloakys cant shoot u thats right but you have to live with the threat all the time and when systems are full with permacloakys most of them just want to be a threat and bring down the live in the system just with being there and afkthat this point is discussed so often shows that it needs some worki dont say lets easy scan for the cloaky and kill them the cloaky must have his cloakybonus but not for those who stand only in a system and maybe engage you every 34 daysthe most of them has a safespot and they stand still all the timeso why not add a effect like a spatial distortion that comes up after some time maybe 30 or 45 minutes and is scanable with probes the permacloaky has to warp away he has to play not to be afk just moving or orbit all the time would not help because his cloak is disrupting the space around maybe 01 authis will leave the cloaky advantage but gives pilots the possibility to do something against afk permacloakysyou can still camp a gate with cloakys who comes to a system and scans the gate with probes  and when you are a scifi fan  in every space scifi series there is a way to find cloaked ships that stand around by tracking his warp signature or because of a spatial distortion or many more

congratulations you just clicked on another afk cloaking thread sort ofso the argument that keeps popping up is that under the current mechanics afk cloaking is the only way to catch people ratting and thats trueimagine trying to catch someone in the slowest ratting ship in the game a carrier with a traditional nano shield bc roam or even a t2 frig roamfirst the carrier pilot undocks and scans down a newly spawned sanctum since its new it spawns in a new safe spot that nobody has bookmarked yet he warps in at 10mk and then begins full aligning back to the station and then he starts rattingnow the roam gets one system out on the gate ready to jump in the most effective way to catch people is by shotgunning a system everyone jumps in hits their system scanners and everyone warps off to a different anomalyas soon as the carrier pilot sees the first red pop into local he pulls drones and warps to the station or if hes got fighters out he just warps immediately and recalls his fightersthe roaming gang on the other hand has to sit there for a few seconds while their system scanner cycles then wait a few more seconds while their ships warp to each anomunder the current mechanics its very difficult to catch people without having a cloaked ship sitting in the sanctum with themand before we start talking about fixing afk cloaking which i imagine is frustrating and boring for both cloakers and carebears alike we need to make traditional roams a more viable option for catching peoplewe could look at getting rid of the system scanner timer you should just press the scan button and bam instant warp in spots on anomaliesmaybe up the warp speed of interceptors a little bit more also id up the warp speed of heavy interdictors since they have interceptors as a skill prerequisiteand look into putting more scramming frigates in the higher end anomaliesi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
you sure i believe people have lost ships before ratting without afk cloakersthough give it they might have been afk themselves or unattentive

would be nice to see a little more support in this threadfor some reason people seem to flock towards the massive game changing or frankly stupid threads when its the little and quick changes like these that need the support because there is actually a chance of them being implemented
i very much support sometimes it feels like some immersion is lost due to this every ship looks equally big or small1
this bugged me ever since i got into my first battleship later it was ridiculous that my raven dwarfed my chimeraalso the stations need fixing even more than the ships as detailed by the above posterstuff just looks so underwhelmingly small in eve
this thread deserves more attention it seems to get so little attention because there is little to say about it its just a good idea no discussion required really
semi afk cloakies are annoying enough already how many semi afk bombers do we really need outside of valuable moons i cant see this as anything other then a way to spike specific prices technium would be camped 237 by people that had bought up a supply of bombers before this change was implemented way to further  up the moon goo marketsconsidering that poss are anchored the same way that pocos are and generally perform the same function although not with the same free cargo space poco fuels why add the structure in between doesnt the player driven logistics operate in much the same way or do you really just want the automation of a npc hauler out in space it seems like a way to just get the goo without having to take the effort of putting up and paying for your own tower with a regular spawn time you can bully smaller lowsec groups even better as you can either expect a fight and prepare or steal their goo without much effort or cost
this does not attempt to fix the moon goo problem per se i believe the solution to that would be to rebalance the consumption of r64 materials such that a more reasonable profit per moon per month is achieved getting rid of passive isk from moons will disrupt a lot of the larger alliances and will be a much more impacting change that is exactly the goal the main purpose of this change would be to induce fights over smallish resources the semiafk bomber example can be taken care of via ehp and other mechanics if one of your tech cargos is being attacked by a single stealth bomber for an hour and you cant send a single guy to defend it you probably dont deserve that isk to prevent attackers from just cloaking up when a defensive fleet comes into the picture a mechanic that allows the target to warp off and recharge shields unless it is pointed can be introduced that way if the attackers decide to cloak up they will lose all progress and have to start over in the big scheme of things losing 1 shipment will not make or break an alliance the point of this would be to create a way of stealing resources from any entity that engages in passive isk making activities it creates an element of risk and responsibility in order to ensure their passive isk flow my favorite aspect of this is that it creates a pvporiented way of making isk by attacking the passive income operations of other players i would say that most isk making activities are pve oriented except merc work ganking scamming etc
so if your alliance is say australian you automatically lose a good chunk of your income its hard to defend against some guy and his five bomber alts when youre asleep after all
it jsut seems like a really really lazy way of nerfing dreadnoughts cause you dont have to kill a tower anymore and they arent exactly good for much else a single cargo isnt going to break an alliance but two bombers and a cloaky dictor will keep 50 25 of shipments from coming through no need to reinforce that tower though cause you can disrupt its functions without having to do anything to it and while you got several ships guarding the tech shipment those guys are hitting the platinum moon or the vanadium or the  other goos you have in system without having to reinforce anything small corps with a foot hold in lowsec get pushed out of lowsec from roamers that just want to mess with something when you can log in once a day for 4 hours how many shipments are you missing and how much fuel are you paying this idea breaks a lot of things
well yes moon production happens 247 regardless of your time zone from a big picture does it make sense for your alliance to be making riskfree isk with no presence in other time zones no if this actually does happen recruit a useuro pvp corp and tell them there are plenty of targets to shoot at in their tz also this works both ways if you are autz you will have free reign to raid useu tz alliance space look at it from the other perspective this allows for moon production to be attacked without resorting to grinding through pos shields dayindayout using dreads to siege the pos is still an option no one is taking that away cool sounds like you should get a couple pilots into a fleet and engage them i believe that only highend moons will actually be targeted  mainly due to the cost of the cargo intercepted i highly doubt anyone will be chasing after cargo spawns with 5m worth of cargo unless of course they have something against you in which case this change will make things much more interestinga couple people have brought up cloaky sbs as a counterpoint to this proposal a mechanic can be introduced to keep 12 sb away off the top of my head there can be a small npc escort perhaps upgradable via ihubsov to deter solo small cloaky ships from being a big nuisance also expect a reasonable amount of ehp on the cargo shipcontaineretc it shouldnt be something a solo pilot can polish off quickly 10 pilots x 5 minutes x 500 dps  15m damage so maybe 1m ehp before rf and 1m ehp after everyone is reading into this thinking they will be under siege from hostiles 247 if that actually does happen i would call this change a success because that means that there will be more targets in space to shoot at remember this works both ways while the enemy is raiding your space you can raid theirs

liang a well thought out proposition as alwayssigned
thats only because theyre buying the fool things for 10s of billion of isk naturally its going to take awhile to break even for them but the original owners had no such issues and then profited greatly off the resale to those unfortunate suckerszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
this is more what we need its not the tech 2 bpos or lack of them that is the problem its the unfortunate inability to produce a decent tech 2 bpc that it is worthwhile to manufacture from decryptors and their availability and cost and all that nonsense aside the real issue is not having a reason to research a tech 1 bpo before making tech 2 bpcs from it and not benefiting from the research you have done also there is some issue with the difficulty to actually get a tech 2 bpc on invention tests which is a lottery in itself saying youre doing it wrong at this stage is sort of ignorant as one person may get the luck of the draw and regularly produce tech 2 bpcs with great success where another might continuously get failed attempts all other thingsskills includedbeing equalinvention is overrated and underdone its like a half finished project that nobody ever quite got back tozubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
you just ruined all your arguments on that first quote and yes i did know you can effect the bpcs me level with decryptors but it realy is not enoughthis game mechanic is faulty and still needs a change even if it would screw the current t2 bpo owners up that also will effect people i know personaly
actually i think having two independent fleets merge as independent fleets is better than two fleets merging and becoming one fleet having more than one fleet commander is actually a good thing particularly when members of a fleet are accustomed to taking orders from their fleet commander and dont know jack about the other guybetter to just have a system where you can merge multiple fleets as far as overall effect is concerned but still have them as seperate entities simple answer is they all get puplr backgrounds and color coded tags or better yet somebody actually makes a fleet icon and tag that would be visible in chat and elsewhere in addition to the fleet color coding sort of like the little tag with the skull and crossbones for outlaw but only visible to fleet memberscommunication between fleets could be restricted to fcs in a separate channel rather than having everybody using overlapping communications tooedit one thought is that merged fleets could get a separate background color like white to immediately identify them as allies then a fleet colored tag and icon and perhaps we could add an additional smaller color tag in the top left corner that identifies their true affiliation grey for neutral blue for ally red for enemy etc that might be useful elsewhere tooedit2 while im at it ill just add that it would be nice if players could choose which color tag was shown ie for that top left one whether it was in relation to them their corp their alliance or their fleetzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
1 what are independent fleets mergingg but staying independent mean 2 separate entities such as wings or a way to tag the entire other fleet as friendly rather then each character or corp standings adjustment3 this is often taken care of in out of game voice comms
thanks for your feed back mars and some good points there particularly about pilots being used to taking orders from there own fc which is why i think once the merger is complete the joining fleet is put in its own wing that way the joining commander can still control his own fleet independently when it comes to comms if the two fleets are using ingame comms to coordinate there efforts the tools are already there to join them as well but the chances of this are slim unless they are a incursion ratters in other words if they are using mumble vent or ts3 then there own arrangements should be madereminder this should be initialy for small gang war fare at first then developed for larger fleets in the hundreds  thousands in another patch  expansion

and container accessremoval from corp hangars can hardly call that securityand roles in general what are these anyway besides ambiguous unconfigured and undefined without a lot of work and then they lack a great deal anywayand more roles would be nice how about directors not being equivalent to ceos unless the ceo wants them to be ie not immediately gaining full access to master wallets and 1st division hangarshangars so why not have categorized roles directorlike role capabilities currently unavailable outside of director positions soldier rolestitles and whatever else essentially what im suggesting is there should be a more divisive structure there ceo and chairmendirectors then toplevel member rolestitles which are configurable general member rolestitles also configurable and finally more rank oriented rolestitles which may also be partially configurable the latter would of course be compatible with any of the others or could stand alone by itself the former may exist without the latter etc and why do we have to have corporations i never really got that i understand you have to call it something generally speaking but should we be restricted to that sort of structure or havibng that label alliance is fine and some may want to have corporations but why not other options and why shouldnt they have some bearing on internal structureand why do alliances have to be democratic it actually says dictatorial and answers it with no we dont even have the option what sort of absurd joke is this of course i want it to be dictatorial i dont trust anyone zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
your insulting post does exactly what he says if you think that simple idea will actually encourage bounty hunting youre delusionalmalcanis idea works within the existing structure of bounties and killrights to craft a reasonable bounty system in eve why dont you inject reading and comprehension let alone train it
i read it i am utterly opposed to insurance payouts being stolen and used for bounty payments for exactly the reason i said earlier the idea is to promote inspace pvp not station tanking additionally without a killright a bounty is almost meaningless the perp can hide in hisec and if you suicide to attack him you dont get an insurance payment on your ship not very enticingtransferrable killrights are so obviously the correct answer that i hardly know how to explain something so clear and simple to someone who claims not to understand its not even that complex a concept all that complexity is actually additional flexibility in how contracts can be assigned using the contract system enables new modes of player interaction and creating a valid bounty hunting profession in eve for the first time
just so were clear i deeply believe consequences for player actions should always and primarily come from other players the point of a bounty system in my worldview isnt to stop crime but to promote gameplay 3rd party punitive mechanics like taking ship insurance are regressive short0sighted and wrong headed its not for ccp to say that this or that player lifestyle is wrong and should be punished it should purely be the perogative of players to do so it is ccps place merely to give them effective and balanced tools to do so

what legitimate reason do you have for this feature other than being afk andor having your client minimized while cloaked go ahead i can wait there hasnt been a justifiable reason to have this feature written yetit would stand to reason that if you were at your keyboard you would notice your ship decloakingi would support this if it were a visual alert instead of an audible one an audible alarm is a poorly disguised buff to afk cloakingsummary of eves last four expansions
theres only one as far as im concerneddual boxingmulti boxingbut then most could wave that off as well stop the evemail spam
actually thats a pretty good reason didnt think of that i can admit when im wrong and this would be one of those times however this is also a major buff to afk cloakers and for that i cant support thissummary of eves last four expansions
not really a buffid classify this as an ui feature thats no different to it screaming at you when your shields are about to drop more loudly than usualgranted afk cloakers would be extra lazy but in all reallity this isnt a damaging feature in terms of mechanicsand that stupid argument will never go away anywaybut i get where your coming fromas alwaysps and yesyou have to be braindead to miss the fact your not cloaked anymore but most people are that densestupid unfortiantely and you know who you are stop the evemail spam
regardless of the need for such an alarm from a general roleplaying perspective its stupid that we cant adjust the alarm tones and settings on ships we are literally living inim sure most of the people posting in this thread have a custom tone of some sort waking them up in the morning
i agree with the guy that posted about 3rd party toolsa simple api to track who put what ore into the orca or into a corporate division would solve a lot of these problems and with very minimal effort from ccp
all quotes are from this postthis is just terrible now not only is it stupidly expensive to wardec larger targets it becomes cheaper for multiple corporations to wardec smaller targets yes this will make eve much better for new players and the little guy who will be much more likely to ragequitallow me to provide some insight from what most people would call a griefer we are looking for fights most of the highsec war corps and alliances i know arent wanting to sit behind jita in tornados with neutral rr on standby theyre actively out there trying to provoke fleet engagements thats easiest when youre up against hundreds of players instead of dozens that last sentence is going to make this rather stupid really you can just call everyone in for free wars i understand that warfare previously grossly favored the aggressor but this is a swing so far in the other direction that combined with the cost changes will represent a huge reduction in the number of wars when the dev blog starts out by calling the war system underused it makes me wonder what exactly they thought would happen with these changesheres an alternative limit the number of allies that can be called in lets stay the defender can get 2 at that point the aggressor can call in an ally allowing the defender to call in 2 more this will create a sense of escalation to the war rather than defenders being able to call in everyone in highsec looking for a fight so they can all pummel the aggressorwhat makes it even more stupid is that nothing is done about the ability to evade wars entirely through the use of npc corps ive always had the impression that ccp intended for alliances who are fighting for sov to extend their wars into highsec thats a moot point when they can just protect all their trit miners freighters suicide gankers et cetera by putting them in npc corps with absolutely no penalties at allthis paints a rather interesting picture of how things can go lets say goonswarm runs another round of industrial ganks after this new dec system goes live the victims cant retaliate with wardecs because it is costprohibitive this plus the use of npc alts prevents any efforts at preemptive attacks when they do finally scrape up enough cash to hire mercs who can wardec the goons and mount some sort of defense the goons can just let anyone who wants join the war as allies so they can mob the mercenaries into submissioni like most of the proposal but these three things could make for a game world where superalliances are completely protected from wardecs aggressors will be so vulnerable to blobs of allies that even todays typical wars would become unlikely and the end result would be an overall chilling effect on warfare and of course npc corp alts will continue hauling and mining and running missions with no fear of anything bad happening besides being gankedby someone elses npc corp altso what should ccp do1 make wardec costs based on more than the size of the defender if a 15man corp wants to wardec a 1000 member alliance it shouldnt cost them absurd amounts of money the big alliances should be able to swat them like fliesand if they cant or wont defend themselves against those 15 guys then they should reconsider their approach to eve htfu as they say2 change the ally system so that it doesnt wholly favor the defender allow an escalation of war where the defender calls in allies the aggressor responds with their own and they go back and forth until one side or the other runs out of backup andor money3 make npc corps have real drawbacks besides a marginal tax
i suppose i shouldnt have jumped on that suggestion quite as hard as i did but please put some thought into your suggestions before you make them its hard not to respond aggressively to a suggestion that has that many holes in itedit altho i would much prefer some suggestions on how to improve the current proposal rather than all the individual ideas on what should be done to fix titans
i think you are reading too much into the wardec changes they are not going to turn hi sec in to the warzone you obviously think its going to beas far as i am aware the changes are just to make the wars mean something and to get rid of a few exploits that currently existbut i suspect you knew this and were probably unhappy with these changes because it does get rid of exploits that the griefer corps use

stop afk cloacking today
strangely this makes me want to afk cloak the opmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
and what happen when the afk cloaked ship is aligning something  30 minute enough to reach another grid easily so what is the cloaking in same point  pbut we know need something against the risk free afk cloaky fagsmaybe the best one capacitor or something fuel consumption for cloak modules huge comsumption for not cloaky ships and smaller consumption to covert ships
obligatoryremoving local fixes afk cloaky issue
why dont we save you the bother of doing any work to catch people and give you a free km just for showing up in system so you are proposing that we penalise people that are not afk read intel channels and take sensible precautions when ratting lots of ratters die all the time without afk cloaky ship these are usually the ineptasleepafk ratters shouldnt need much effort to catch and kill them nor would you need a cloaky ship in the plexanom with themnot supported
spoiler  theyre all in incursions
confirming only newbies the stupid and the non botting afk should ever die pveing in null im not sure what it is your not supporting as the op didnt propose anything other than a discussionthe answer to the op is the removal of 100 flawless effortless intel that is local chat intel should require more effort than opening your eyes and looking at the chat chanel
i find it ironic that you are complaining about free killmails on a wouldnt it be nice if people could go roaming instead of afk cloaking threadactually no id just like to take away the 10 second or so head start ratters get to warp out youd still have a competition between weither or not someone can warp to your site faster than you can warp out as soon as they pop into localthe mortality rate in nullsec is just out of balance right now in my previous example a ratting carrier can be 100 safe from getting chased down by even a t2 frigate roam as long as he notices them and clicks the warp button in under 10 secondsactually i left out intel channels from my example on purpose i really like intel channels as an example of emergent gameplayno matter how fast someone can warp to your site if you are watching intel and you see a bunch of dudes saying hey bro there are a bunch of drakes headed right into your ratting pocket and you dont dock up and get in a home defense fleet then you deserve to explodeyeah but id like to be able to kill something more than just moronsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
some interesting ideas but i feel like there isnt enough variant when it comes to the issues you could set a 30 sec delay to local keep the scan timer and still effectively have the same thing just a different way to look at the same picture also i would like to see covops cloaked not posted in local as this defeats the purpose of black ops operations and guerrila warfare essentially covert ops and black ops arent really living up to there name if the locals have 100 intel on you all the time if things indeed need to stay the way they are with local i suggest a rename of ship classescovert ops  scout shipstealth bomber  bomber with cloakforce recons  electronic assault cruiserblack ops  glorified mini titansmmos come and go but eve remains garresh
reading these threads always makes me laugh so let me paraphrase this a bit blah blah blah blah carebear all need to die i want to becoming a pvping carebear and not have to do anything special to get a kill i want to be able to come into a system and push an iwin button and create carebear tears you are no different from the people you want to kill like others have said in this thread if you are not able to get kills now you are doing something wrong
reading these threads always makes me laugh so let me paraphrase this a bit i want to ride out hulkageddon safely tucked away in pet renter spacelook this all comes down to one question what should the mortality rate of nullsec bein order to live in a space you need to be able to get more resources out of the space than you sink into it so that you can grow so lets say hypothetically that in order to run a sanctum youll need a 500 mil ship faction bs or pimp fit ahac and lets say that each sanctum pays out about 50 mil each so in order to break even on your 500 mil ship you need to run a 50 mil sanctum 10 times in peace without blowing up and lets say we want to give they player a 50 return on investment for willing to live out in null thats another 280 mil and now we are up to 15 sanctums run in peace without explodingnow if on average your navy dominix did blow up and need to get replaced once every 15 sanctums thats still ok because every time you fit a new ship for 500 mil its going to give you 750 back before going up in flamesnow i can prove that the mortality rate of ratting mining in null is way off based on two things that exist1 ratting supers  titansweve all seen these things you warp to a haven sanctum and there is a nyx with 20 fighters out or a titan sitting 100k off blapping battleshipsthe fact that people can buy a titan which last time i checked went for around 50 bil and looking at the payout of a sanctum say to themselves yeah i think i can run 1000 sanctums undisturbed before i can make my money back and make this thing a profitable investment2 renterstrue carebears are the most risk averse people in space your average empire carebear wont go into lowsec and wont even undock during a wardeck but they are willing to pay someone to live out in null thats because of the whole nullbear phenomenon where a lot of people feel that certain areas of nullsec are safer than highseceven if they did think of losing ratting and mining ships in pure terms of return on investment then there is still the incredibly high renter fees that their owning alliances charge them to live in nulland just to drive this point home here is a ratting titan in a renter alliance
what i like to do when trying to catch ratting bots is to anchor a bubble at the 0 warp in point at a belt then i leave system and standby next door give it about 15 minutes then jump back in youll find the ratting bot stuck in the bubble attempting to warp out and failingsummary of eves last four expansions
get rid of local then your prey doesnt know youre in system until you show up on dscanseriously though youre complaining about someone having 1015 seconds warning that a gang might be inbound and you want to take away their ability to escape in the event that they are actually prepared to escape a cloaky alt on the gate would give them the same amount of warning seeing the gate flash would be the signal to pull drones
honestly thats one of the dumbest ideas i heard in a long timetry to think about it this waymoon mining plays its biggest part highest value goo in 00 spacethat is where alliances are fighting over each other techmoonsalliances that can easily bring several hundred battleships or plenty of capitals and supercaps on the fieldthese wont care about the npc haulers or whatever you try there they just blow away the entire tower an place their ownin lowsec where the lesser value goo is found its an entirely different storyyou open up every harvesting tower to interdiction by every prick with a gun unless your corp covers all timezones with a decent pvp presence and can motivate your players to guard the towers all the time this imho doesnt qualify for actively playing the game eitherthat in turns means that you threw all small scale corps that run their own t2 production business some of which dont have a pvp wing anyways that cannot cover 2357 out of the t2 production business increasing t2 prices might be the resulti think we already have enough powerblocks and huge corporationsalliancesi think encouraging smaller scale operations is the right way rather then to make it increasingly harder for a bunch of 5 friends to do anything in this game as you need a 24hour coverage for any serious undertakingnext thing you complain about is that the skills keep training even while beeing logged of and not doing anything ingameso they generate free sp 247as you can see from the moon material prices complex reaction its hard enough at the moment to make a profit out of your pos unless you own a highvalue moon such as technetium but even in lowsec you wont hold your tech moon for long if you are unable to defend it against one of the major 00 powersflame away
yes as evidenced by what happened in venal this weekend alliance tech moon combat has turned into a whoeverbringsthebiggestblob wins i am trying to introduce a mechanic that would allow combat over tech moons which favors smaller gangs over large blobslet me answer your question with an example consider a moon that makes 600m per month that puts it at about 20m per day or about 5m per cargo shipment with the proposed ehp a 5 man gang can take it out in 10 minutes which comes out to 6 cargo shipments per hour 5m per shipment  6 shipments  30m this works out to 6mhour for 5 people for grinding structures in the ideal case they will probably end up spending more on ammo than they made in profit bumping up the moon profit to 12bmonth will yield 12mhour with 5bmonth moons theoretical profit goes up to 50mhour once you factor in travel time scanning time and availability the expected return is going to be much lower of course these numbers should be balanced to achieve the desired result doublinghalfing the ehp will modify iskhr potentiali highly doubt that anyone will be chasing low end moons for profit to be perfectly honest im not sure what the impact will be to t2 production the way i see it if they operate in lowsec they are accepting the risk that comes with the territory this will actually hurt larger powerblocs more than the smaller ones they are the ones with the highend moons that are the intended targets there is no financial incentive to target the lowerend moons a small 5 man corp would not be able to hold any of the highend moons anyway so i fail to see the point
the first problem with your post this belongs in fi until it is well thought out and ready to present to the csm for discussion now onto my thoughts regarding your idea i like your line of thought additional small gang targets are always a huge plus this fits in very well with the farms  fields discussion that ccp raised old forums right before the forum change around incarnas release stealing tech would become very much a worthwhile activity however 1 it makes no sense that they travel tofrom a planets pocos the mining laser is at the pos which orbits the moon and its mining the moon hence why is there any interaction with the planet 2 for the purpose of logic you would need to move the mining array which gathers the materials away from the storage container ie its silo but both of these are not only located inside the pos which is powering them but are also connected to each other do you see the logic problems here for these transport ship to exist there should be a needreason to transport the materials from point a to point b 3 the only reason youd want npcs to move the materials as opposed player characters is so its easier to snag are you planning on providing npc escorts do they web scram rr etc etc etc taking from an npc is rather shady imo 4 rf timers suck dont add more of them to the game i would suggest that making a lot of changes both for the sake of gameplay and for the sake of sanity here are a couple of thoughts a defending a pos structure sucks and requires time for a response hence the stupidly large ehp and rf timers b the pos owner is putting his money and equipment at 247 risk of being attacked imo if youre going to steal the moongoo from the pos you should be putting something at risk too and shooting an npc doesnt hack it a much better alternative imo would be something like the following this is a very rough idea that just popped into my head a mining ray deflector something you anchor between the moon harvesting array and the moon that deflects a portion of the harvested goods into your secondary collecter every harvest cycle the secondary collecter steals moongoo not necessarily all  only allow it to hold 2 hours worth of goo  make it easily deployed under 5 minute anchorunanchor time and about the size of a medium warp bubble make it easily destroyed around 100k ehp  make it inexpensive id aim at a1m price tag  have it create a km when destroyed a to record the theiving alliance b to give a defender proof of his efforts  it needs to be deployed ongrid of the pos but not necessarily within pos weapons range  when anchored have it send out the standard pos is under attack notifications the benefits of this 1 by remaining out of range of the pos weapons a small gang can maraude any moon 2 only a small response is necessary to remove the threat leaving this a small gang activity 3 a pressence near the moon mining tower is suddenly necessary in order to maintain a valuable tower this mechanic would be a huge boon to lowsec dwellers as while major nullsec alliance typically wield the power to control ownership of these moons they lack the local pressence to keep them from being marauded they might just pay a lowsec pirate group to do just that
i want to know if you have ever managed a mining tower chain or single tower im not saying that your idea doesnt have a certain logic to it im saying that its not realistic for this game there are a lot more people in lowsec that would kill a goo hauler just to annoy you and not for profit saying that there isnt a financial reason to do it isnt a reason in itself for people not to do it it means that you have to have someone around 2357 or whenever the goo spawns or you dont get paid for that time period larger alliances will mess with small holders just to mess with small holders where as they wont necessarily get the manpower to kill a tower who volunteers to siege a lowsec tower over a roam there is no incentive for a small holder group to attempt to mine goo in lowsec if they cant have some security in their investment that security is in the rf timer they have a way to make sure they can respond to the threat with your hauler idea they cannot rather this just means that t2 markets will get even more messed up and those that have stockpiles of t2 mats will become richer or those that have deep null towers powerblocks who can defend their space vs small lowsec holders who cant 2357 secure their space who wins this isk war
1 allow alliances to set 23 systems as capitals or even a region 2 this region would be the carebear santuary and industry center of an alliance2 alliance capital stargates must be sieged by fleets inorder to access them by any neut or red4 redsneuts would be rejected upon trying to enter unless the gate had been attacked properly5 constructive feed back please
we already have that i thinkshah fluffers or in response to him at least power projection being bottlenecked by rigs is something i wouldnt have considered an issue in my view logistics for one person to move things around is already a pain in the arse without adding rigs to the equation what really happens is people either get annoyed and repackage the ship anywaydestroying the rigsor it sits in some station for ages waiting to be moved generally medium or smaller it gets repackaged at least thats been my experience that doesnt mean you go out and buy rigs either actually i think the opposite is true you decide not to bother buying rigs for larger ships anymore unless theyre cheap and easily aquired that means no trimarks shield extenders or anything on the high end of rediculously expensivebeing able to repackage rigs would actually increase the market for these things and put more in the game as it stands there really doesnt seem to be enough salvage to make all rigs viable for manufacture and quite often the market is bare of a number of varieties for various reasonsgiven what ive seen with rig production i dont believe it would hurt at all to make them repackageablezubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

would it surprise you to learn that there are hundreds of systems that dont see a single player sometimes for days highsec is crowded because over 80 of the playerbase lives there they have little to no interest in lowsecnullsecwormhole space for various and valid reasonstheres plenty of space out there for yousummary of eves last four expansions
there are plenty of systems in the game that have few if any people flying through them oh wait they are not highsecnot supported
highsec also has mission agents that spawn infinite missions for everyone give it thats just for missioning and the belts and rats dont grow with the size of people interesting i wonder if it is every system that is packed in highsec because highsec regions tend to be the largest one highsec region is close to 4 nullsec ones compare venal to domainforge not supported

i think i lke ccps proposal better in fact i know i doproblemseconomized variations lack the ability to fit a full range of modules and fittings i dont think that will help matters here players already place restrictions on how ships are fit and quite often that limits t1 ships to tech 2 modules for cost related purposes also capital ships are all t1 as are battlecruisers and battleships which make up a large number of the fighting ships your suggestion seems to be that t1 shouldnt have access to these fittings you might want to clarify that and if not that then what are you referring too militia ships are free with limited replacements so militia guys just fly to the local station at which they have a weekly allotment of prefit hulls they get to destroy and can trade around so no ships really get destroyed in faction warfare nor can they be repackaged and sold also theyre prefit so no module purchases are required thats going to go over well one guy with 10 alts could have a lot of free ships by this method corporation branding good in essence and im sure many like the idea problem youre configuring the ships with rigs that repackage with the ship at a basic level this isnt so bad but its got very limited diversity and youll end up with 20 corporations selling the same thing anyway id rather see research produce unique bpos that the researcher can adjust for final product which can then be fit with rigs and various other modules as normal much more variety that way and provided it is implemented with some care could be very useful and a major asset to roleplaying and content in generali still dont see tech 3 as a generalized ship except in terms of the base hull once youve spent the isk on the various subsystems and fit it all together youve made it specialized i think its sad that players feel it should be this way tech 3 has a lot of potential and it seems the playerbase wants to marginalize it and make tech 3 ships second rate and barely improved over t1 versions that fill the same roles theyre expensive for a reason and the wwhole idea is that they are a technological advancementzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
i always thought it was a bit weird myself and saw no need for it we are talking about the internet here even ccp covers most employees real identities up with ccp yournewnamehere given not all of them enjoy that luxury all the time but it is there for a reasonnot all of us would threaten or harm anyone on the internet for any reason but there are those who do and those who will the internet is also such a place that it is very easy to be paranoid personally i applaud the csm for having the balls to stick their names out there all benefits aside its still a risky move given the representation the playerbase of eve provides for itself on more occaisions than not maybe too risky who am i kidding its always too risky honestly with the amount of hacking and tracking out there i dont think hiding your name is enough anymore and im near the point where i believe the only thing you can do is unplug from the internet seriously when are they going to get some decent software to protect peoples computers given everything they have and how simple such a task should be youd think theyd have done it already of course that would prevent the government and law enforcement from snooping too and thats probably why they havent microsoft could easily have built this into their operating systems by now if they had wanted to they havent of course because they like looking tooerr that is supported zubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
malcanisi really like your op however i have two questions1 would the hunted party be made aware of the fact that a bounty contract has been placedaccepted on them2 would the hunted party be able to veiw who has accepted the contract on them
i dont immediately see why the hunted party should be able to know either of those things id be interested to hear the case for them to if you have one
lets say player x decided to invite an enemy fleet into the middle of your fleet consting you the loss of your whole fleet does that not require retaliationanyhow it was just an idea and make a point that there are deeds done in the game that need retaliation also the 500mil was just an exampleand i would also like to know will the player whos head is on the plate recieve any information who can shoot at him or will it be more like now you died and dont even know what hit youshould the bountyhunters at least be flagged with a icon like a green skull or something so that you know who they are when you see them on the gate
we covered this on page 2 of the thread i think there will be player crimes that definitely merit retaliation that are not suitable for bounty hunting to deal with i believe the example i used was how do you create a mechanical system that allows for a bounty to be put on a corp thiefs head that doesnt expose a corp director who legitimately expends corp fundsbasically the only way you could differentiate would be by gm intervention with all the problems that entails
well splendid that i has been on table also then 
it is not really casemore of an opinionid say maintain the wanted stamp from the current system but do not provide the current isk figure we dont want the dirty scum suckers to know now much you dropped on themie let them sweat how long they are going to have to be looking over their shoulderid say no to this one if we assume my suggestion for question 1 is used the wanted party is already aware they may be hunted let them find out the hard way that someone was hunting them although eve is riskso if the bounty hunters catch them the bounty hunters should receive the normal aggression flaging to the wanted party and the wanted partys corp
although ive had this debate with you before i really feel i have to get you to see the sense in my argument i really hate to end up bumping this thread but i have to say something the system you propose will be useless outside of highsec or lowsec because you never get killrights outside of either i dont even remember the last time i had killrights on someone also no one wardecs people in lowsec so your idea about using it within wars is well only useful in highsec so basically youll turn it into a highsec featurewho said anything about stealing insurance i hate to say it but i think you may have misunderstood somethingall that is required to fix the bounty system is for bounties to be paid as a percentage of the person your huntings over all isk loss with all things accounted for and then that value needs to be subtracted from their overall bounty leaving the rest to be claimed at a later timei know what your going to say but without killrights it will be used to grief people yes yes it will but there are much much more isk efficient ways to grief people suicide ganking war deccing scams corp infiltration pay mercs to wardec etc etcthen the bounty hunting system will be useful everywhere and before you say i dont get how you dont understand why killrights needs to be a requirement there is nothing not to understand i understand perfectly oh except neither of these bounty ideas will effect whether you fight on a station on a gate etc etc so i dont understand that statementalso my idea is better than yours is not a valid argument before you try that one againin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
station tanking is a euphemism for staying docked just so you knowstealing insurance isk for bounty payouts is explicitly taking sides in a capsuleer vs capsuleer dispute its about on a par with giving the defenders a 25 resist bonus to armor and shields in their own sov spaceso no
oh i forgot to mention that with the simpler system you wouldnt even require contractsin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
as soon as i get ve sec i laugh at your bounty what now
doesnt make any difference what your sec status is in the simpler model as far as im aware do explain in the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
thats the goal were trying to achieve if you are low or null your are fair game and deserve no killrights people can fight each other in low and null all they want already modifying the way people fight in low and null is a sticky matter and another discussion entirely besides it is a solution in search of a problem there is no need for killrights in low or null
i think there is a way to solve everyones issuesuse the simpler solution on the current bounty system then introduce bounty contracts as a separate feature with optional killright transferal one step at a time and all that best of both worldsedit will post more tomorrow need to sleep damn the necessity to sleepin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
lets get this it will help afk cloakies rubbish sorted shall weno one really likes afk cloakies even they themselves dont enjoy it would an audio notification of cloak failing help them no practically never i hate to have to explain why but here we goif they are truly afk the audio wont reach them thats a pretty obvious one if they are in a safe spot cloaked no one will ever get near them so their cloak will never fail so no help for them there so lets take a situation where it on the face of things appears as if it may aid them in their afknessso idiot in a cloak is sitting 50km off a station afk because for some reason he thought that would be a good idea he is alt tabbed and doing something else his alarm goes off he hears that he has been uncloaked and so he alt tabs back to his client to save his ship alt tabbing takes a while and he stumbles to find something to warp to on his overview aligning takes a while too of course which is too bad because by that time they had blown up his pod some time ago i can personally think of no instances where it would help someone who is afk now a few of you are saying who needs it its easy to tell when you get uncloaked if you find it so easy you have no reason to post here i know i will just get a load of your a n00b comments following my next few sentences but oh well good pvpers in general have their camera zoomed out to get a good idea of what the battlefield landscape is like so you cant visually see if your cloaked anyway your ship is too small most of the time you can watch the cloaking mod but frankly when im counting hostiles on overview and making sure ive got it right for reporting intel and that im not too close to anyone i have more important areas of the screen to look at never mind the whole host of situations where plain forgetfulness comes into itit should always be perfectly clear even without looking at the subtle green flashing of that mod whether your cloak is still intact i say again if you dont have a problem with this then you have no reason to complain that people might like an audio notification if your worried about afk cloakies getting benefits then your misinformed to be polite if your screaming ah just dont be a n00b and it will be fine well what if you actually are new it would be nice for it to be more intuitive this is a clunky ui issue and that is all it isin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

this is probably the single biggest problem with the current wardec system and a major barrier to longterm subscriptionsand ccp is apparently planning to do nothing about it
mayby a new ship type thats bigger than a titan
i would go with two ships actually split the bridging clones and fleet bonuses off the titan for a mothership hull titans in a pure combat role makes sense though i think the whole titans shooting subcaps thing will be a thing of the past soon ccp seems to be on the right path to fixing them post fan fest
hmmm but with the fleet bonuses on the mothership you would have to bring it into the combat system to take advantage of them which may not be a bad thing more of them will get killed the other thought is that if you are putting the fleet bonuses on the mothership you need to have 1 for each race or give all 4 titan fleet bonuses to 1 ship alternately allow the mothership to fit 1 or 2 of the possible 4 fleet bonuses at once given these options i think i would still prefer the fleet bonuses on the titani also think the capital weapons should be given a dedicated platform and the superweapon buffed to compensate what would be your reasoning for keeping them together

yeah and cocaine addicts wont hit you unless they notice you it should be legal then right
just need remove afk fags from game which happened in 2004 the game disconnected them after 30 minute inactive play and the afk fags issue is solved dbut what i said  maybe the best one capacitor or something fuel consumption for cloak modules huge comsumption for not cloaky ships and smaller consumption to covert shipsthe risk free afk cloaking is a crap its time to add to cloaking more risk
what is all this about cloaca bots nowoh and to the op no
yes afk cloaking should just be banned  removed and so on no need to talk about that 
they dont need to read intel channels they see 1 neutral they warphell if the ratting carrier wanted to it could keep ratting till someone warped inuncloaked and hit warphowever the suggested changes wouldnt change  scramming frigates get blown up in seconds and faster warp isnt gonna be fast enough unless its 50x faster if you want roaming to be effective local needs to be delayed 3060 seconds
please do not forget to remove tier for mining barges in your balancing project few exemples of role for mining barges the procurer could be the industrial mining barge low yield high cargohold but less than a rigged hulk of course the retriever could be the combat mining barge medium yield good ehp low cargo the covetor remains the t1 mining barge of choice the mining ship t1 high yield medium cargofew exemples of role for industrials  wreathe the attack industrial very fast and agile low cargo hoarder the support industrial bonus with shield transfer energy transfer bonus with scanner etc medium cargo could be use to support mining barge in belt or even in a combat fleet the battlebadger can be used as reference for support industrial mammoth the combat industrial good tank high cargoabout the survability of exhumers and mining barges i think a little buff in ehp could be nice to compensate the increase of ganking capability introduced with crucible  destroyerproposalwhat a mining barge need is an active tank especially in 00 and not a super buffer to protect them from gankersusing deadspace shield booster should not be mandatory so they need a buff to their capacitor and more pg even if it might open the door for a lse ii that could be the way to provide them more ehp balance between tank or yield will be limited by the cpua full tank combat retriever able to survive in a 00 belt against npc should be the reference the hulk will be the better version more expansive but with a better yieldedit btw more pg is also the ability to fit a propulsion mod instead of a tank

noif you do not know how to counter the drones it realy is your own personal issue some players spend alot of time to skilling up drones cause they can be used aas an defensive weapon your proposal will render most of their training and also make some of the battleships useless also gallente fawors drones as an offensive weapon should gallente abandon their combat doctorine cause you dont know how to attack a battleshipbest would just be that you would learn how to counter the drones after this the bs is relativly easy target for youso no point changing the game so it would be easier for you
lets just remove drones entirely nothing in combat that isnt flown by a playeri was kidding but that could make fleet comps a lot more diverse
clearly you dont know how to fly frigates if youre getting shot down by dronesalso just shoot the drones unless your enemy is in a dominix theyre gonna run out of drones before you run out of ammo
i just want to note that the carebear community rejects the idea that the op is one of us we wish to distance ourselves from the op
thank you for your feedback this is my first proposal if anyone can move it to the appropriate subforum please do so thanks i am not attached to any of the specifics here i believe the best place for this encounter to happen would be somewhere near the moon but offgrid if someone wants to fill in the blanks with all the finer details to make it fit into the universe better please be my guest the point of the npcs was to counter cloaky sb gangs there is nothing preventing them from shooting at the target and then cloaking up when the defense arrives that was the original intention of the npc escorts that can be replaced with static defensesetc or if ccp deems sb harassment to be valid then we can just skip this all together im not a huge fan of this so if anyone has better ideas of how to achieve the similar results im all ears ill explain the need for rf timers below a ill explain the need for ehprf timers belowb risk is balanced vs reward not attacker vs defender with the current design moon mining poses are not at risk from small fleets only large subcap fleets or dreadssupers and with this model the largest fleet will generally always win this favors the larger coalition  which is why cfc holds something like 50 tech moons
my concern with the deflector idea is that a single pilot can go through an entire region anchor the deflectors on all moons come back in 2 hours and profit any deflectors that are destroyed can be written off at no big loss this will impact moon miners and hurt their profits however i dont think it will achieve the goal of inducing fightsthe large ehp mechanic is designed to force a group of pilots to be at fixed point in space for some nontrivial time a group of 5 pilots with an average of 500 dps can deal 1 million ehp worth of damage in 67 minutes during this window the entire gang has to be on grid and is vulnerable to counterattack the rf timer mechanic is designed to give the defense an opportunity to form up and come defend their assets with the current pos model structures have extremely high ehp and long rf timers this works great for highvalue strategic assets eg csaas but as i mentioned before it does not fit well into small gang warfare by creating a smaller target with lower ehp and shorter rf timer we would be allowing small roaming gangs to use the same mechanics to get fights  just on a smaller scaleone of the imporant things here is that i want to put the defense on equal footing as the attacker this means balancing rewards they are both shooting for the same prize as well as timing opportunities the defender has to be given adequate time to form up to defend while at the same time keeping the timersgrinding reasonable for a small roam
i have never managed a mining tower chain ill be the first to admit that i have limited experience in that part of the game as i mentioned in my last post i want to make sure this is equitable for all sides of the equation so please continue to provide feedback from the pos owner sidepeople kill haulers in lowsec because its a quick easy kill which can potentially yield a juicy kill mail haulers die in a matter of seconds making them very good targets in my experience towers are shot for several reasons 1 financial 2 to provoke fights 3 you dont like somebody i believe the first point is addressed via diminishing timeisk returns as you mentioned if no one is around the second point is moot as for the last one i think the proposed mechanic would make the game much more interesting its really no different than wardecs or ganking hulks in highsec nothing in eve is safe from such things why should moon mining be any differenti believe this fits into the overall eve universe design there is no safety for investments in eve and definitely not in lowsec right now moon mining is protected from small gangs by way of huge ehp buffers this encourages large fleetblob warfare at the cost of small gangsthat said i have no idea what impact this will have on the t2 market i believe the closest mechanic that this relates to are pocos yes individual pocos can be shot and taken out but does that really have a huge impact on the pi market my gut is telling me that this will have no real effect on the market excluding speculation and if it does it give miningproduction bears financial motivation to get involved with pvp recruit offtz pilots hire mercs etc either way it makes the universe more dynamic volatile puts more pilots into space and hopefully creates more pewpew opportunities
im confused with your above statement a cloaky sb gang will rf your npc hauler long before the moon miners know whats happening there is no way that a response gang can get into system before the cloakers rf the npc once the npc is rfd the cloakers cloak up and stay cloaked until it comes out of rf if noone comes they decloak pop the hauler and scoop the loot i dont see how your npcs counter cloaky gangs at all in fact it makes a cloaky gang virtually risk free and unstoppable as they just stay cloaked if you bring ships they cant deal with all they lose is ammo nothing forces people to be on field during the rf phase and nothing keeps them from cloaking i think you have a very big misunderstanding on how things actually work regarding moongoo1 any alliance worth their salt can rf a large moonmining pos within 10 minutes  5 minutes depending on their size this is not enough time for a response gang to form up and hence the reason for pos rf timers rf timers essentially are a tool to allow people on both sides to cta up for a big fight rfs are tricky if its too long you get big gangs if its too short noone will respond 30 minutes is very short 2 the valuable moons in a region are rarely close to the owners home constellation if you look at where the valuable moons are and where their population of the owning alliance resides youll find they are quite often 1040 systems away 3 if it requires a decent size gang to take down the tower you need a decent size gang to fend them off 3 moongoo is an alliance resource sure some of its income trickles down to average members as ship replacements cap loans etc but especially for large alliances the only benefit a moon provides to average joe is the opportunity for a fight so your goal is to create a fight for small gangsquestions i think need answer a how are the defenders notified of the attack a posisunderattack like mail as soon as you shoot the npc b do these npc haulers show up on scan how does the attacking gang know when they are there to attack what kind of timewindow is there to engage the npc its one thing to look on dotlan and see which systems have a tech moon and setup a mining deflector on your own time its another to be on an npcs schedule c given its very easy to blueball the defenders why would anyone come to defend if they arrive and have nothing to shoot they will quit coming d why would anyone come to protect the npc hauler just blow it up and loot it yourself who would knowthe goal is not the loot the goal is the fight in order for the locals to fight they need a reason to come
additional points with my suggestion  while a lone cloaker could setup deflectors around a region a lone defender could destroy them all  coming to defend the mining pos gets you a km meaning you can be rewarded with pretty blue explosions you get to loot what drops from the deflector and youre efforts might even be rewarded by your corp even if you dont get a good fight  the deflector creates a nice staging point for a fight since there isnt quite the same immediacy that your npc hauler creates there can be planned ambushes on either side and only a minor force is necessary to start the fight  fights escalate on their own all big hp structures do is set a minimum number of ships to start the fight by leaving the number of ships extremely small 12 you get more kitchen sink rather than organized response gangs this creates much much more entertaining fights realize if they report 5 bcs are rfing your hauler people wont come with less than 5 bcs and youre far more likely to get blobbed if they report 24 frigates defenders are much more likely to come with a manageable and engageable response
i always see lots of remove empire or nerf low sec posts eve strives to be as real as possible whens the last time you tried to hop a plane to syria or iraq not going to happen right there are borders and officials that keep everyone safe by restricting movement both ways lets apply that to eve in almost the exact same manner this would help keep the carebears as safe as they choose to be  see part 2  and also add some more manufacturing to low sec1 passports treated as a removable augmentation that allows access to gates in and into empire space a passport system will fundamentally change the way everyone plays the game to access any gate in or into empire space you will require a passport with sufficient ratings to travel empire space the ratings would be based on two things your concord security status and your personal standing with the faction holding sovereignty in the systemfor example if secstat  00  no 10 system access if secstat   10  no 90 system access if secstat   20  no 80 system access if secstat   30  no 70 system accessetc etcif secstat   50  no empire access this way gankers and roaming lowsec people cannot access higher level systems at all after messing up too many times there is already a system to repair your secstat if if falls to low so i will not go into that topic the second rating would be with the faction holding sovereignty if they dont like you they dont let you in based on the same number scheme as above making corporation standing factor into this may or may not work but the idea can certainly be explored this would mean that if you are heavy into factional warfare and have picked your side guess what the people that you have been shooting at take offense and you will have to repair that standing before going into their space again there may need to be a system to repair this standing but it can be offered in terms of missions and the like for all the lownull sec people reading this and deciding that this will do nothing but protect the carebears even more please pay attention to the rest of this proposal as it has explosions like all passports yours can be forged treat it as an implant that can be researched manufactured and built at any nonempire pos  think boosters  the better standing you want the most time  cost involved in forging the documents they would be illegal to have in your hold in empire and would face the same restrictions that contraband does now also there would be a chance based on the quality of the passport that you will be caught and it would be removed and you will be treated as having 100 status  standing also traveling with out one would be the same and 100 as only really bad guys travel with no passport a replacement original would be avaliable for free from any concord customs office as well as at entrance gates to empire space now on to point number the second apply the current sovereignty system to boarder systems 04 if a large empire based corporation wants to mine better minerals they can join the empire faction of choice and attempt to take control of neighboring lowsec systems think of it as fighting for your country in contested areas that need attention there will obviously be systems that concord holds fast  think the us boarder  and areas that everyone can fight over if the factional warfare people can claim control over a system for more than a month the security status goes up slightly  04  045 if that control is maintained for enough time concord stations guns at the gates and the passport system comes into effect the no mans land systems will be static the minerals  ores will be the same so empire will never have full access to lowsec resources using this method this means with forged papers you can come in swap to your real credentials and wreak havoc on everyone and bring the system status down and drag the system back to lowsec with all the people in it this means that he carebears of empire will have to either stay home or can try and bring civilization and order to the lowsec areas with bigger gunsthat is all please discuss and put mind in motion before mouth in gearmichael loneyps additional points  thought passports will be destroyed if you are killed by concord so you get one gank per passport  bring extras  addition of new skills or modules to make boarder crossing easier  bribery  or hiding contraband more effective  secret compartments  all factional sovereignty structures would be avaliable via or discounted by lp stores wardecs would not be required to fight in no mans land systems but a security hit still happens concord will never take over a 04 system i will leave it to ccp if they want the players to be capable of expanding empire space
it sounds like you both want to make a hard limit forbidding people bad sec status from going into specific highsec systems by making the passport and make it easier for people with bad status by letting them make fake passportsi think that it greatly takes away from the sandbox to do anything like this the current system where faction police attack people with poor standings works better than thisand if you insist on rl analogies the current system is more like rl in rl youre not physically prevented from entering a country without a passport youll just be arrested if you get caught just like faction police attacking people in the current systemalso lore wise i dont think the empires can actually control the gates and who they allow through because gates are old tech that no one understands they can only react after the person enters the system by shooting the persontldr i believe the current system is better for eves sandbox and there is no gameplay rp or even rl basis for adding this
for those who are tldrno and i agree with the above quoted sentimentstatement of coursejust nothe whole idea of eve online is sandboxdo as you pleaseright now you can show up in a 100 sec rated toon and freely fly around high sec without much troublein your podbut no one said you couldnt do that in a frigateor any ship for that matter within reason obviouslythis would put too much restrictioni appluad the idea of making a sec rating count for something which is why im being niceyes dont die and have a heart attackbut this tilts the balance a little to far to the high sec peepsnot supporting stop the evemailUFFFDspam
simple concept  be be affraid of change plus you provided no justifiable reason its a bad idea
it makes areas of nullsec into invulnerable carebear sanctuaries that alone is enough to make it a bad idea nowhere in eve is supposed to be safe
im not sure i like the specific mechanics youve mentioned but i do like the idea of capital systems which are in some way different to or upgraded differently to standard sov systems even something as simple as being able to handle 2 jump bridges or a specific type of csaa maybealternatively it could be the only system to be able to hold a csaa that would cut down on certain ships being made
yeahcomplete and total noob making suggestions shouldnt be allowed to be quite honest stop the evemailUFFFDspam
not really there are arguments for and against and only by a handful of players
you mean zero likes and a whole lot of pointing the preverbile stick in your general direction indicating you dont know what your talking aboutyep stop the evemail spam
damnit you may be right
how about a new sciance skill that you could train up and the skill would reduce the cooldown time up to what ever ccp thinks is right thinking about balance tough jumping between clones isnt in my own opinion a huge thing even if you could do it every 12haka this
how do you figure
why keep a thread up that was made 1 month later than another active frontpage thread on the same issue
its not the only thing making eve feel small but its certainly one of the contributing factorswhen i first started to pvp i would jc to empire regularly to buy ships in jita and move them to our logistics base i would jc to our empire base to help out with pvpu courses and jc back to venal all the time currently my indy alt manufactures invents and trades in highsec while also doing trade and pi in nullsec without jcs it would be far mor treacherous to move between my highsec bases and my nullsec bases essentially i dont have to spend time traveling much becuase i can jc before i knew about pd hopping and jump clones i had to fly between destination which was moderately time consuming and inconvenient enough for me to centralize my activities given the methods of instatraveling across the universe theres really no reason to centralize you activiites when im visiting multiple regions across the universe every week without using gates it really makes the universe feel small
use a dictor then warp to gate at range pop bubble power to edge wait
new bonus 75 per racial cruiser level to small and medium remote shieldarmor rep module cycle timethis would be to possibly replace one of the obsolete bonuses on t1 logis currently and the bonus is only applied to either shield or armor depending on the racial logi type eg exequror gets 75 to small and medium remote armor rep module duration per lvl and vice versaclose to halving the cycle time of a module puts the medium rep module effectively closeish in rep stats to its bigger sibling having a 75 means max level is 375 so not quite eclipsing the large reppers but the fact the reps land faster med t2 remote rep with max skills would be 28sec cycle time means t1 logi cruisers are more usable in fleets where ships are a little more squishy as they can land reps faster cause lets face it running a t2 logi with large reppers in a sub t2 cruiser gangfleet is a bit of a waste although i have seen it done however less expensive logis with inferior tanks can with this change give a much more desirable but limited support role to sub t2 cruiser fleets obviously it wont remove the possibility of ships being instapoppedalmost halving the cycle time also affects the cap requirements for the logi too and being med rep mods rather than large it also has a lower max rep distance personally i believe this change would bring meaningful use of t1 logis back for small gangs and lower sp pilotsjust wondering how many people would consider this proposal to be acceptable
supported its a shame that aspiring logi pilots have to wait till they get t2 logi before they can be effective in a logistics roleor at least thats the mentality many have due to the inadequacy of t1high five yeah cest la eve 
sounds like an interesting idea but they will definitely need a cap use bonus too they have enough cap stability issues asis they could also use either a bit more tank or a bit more room for tank theyre a bit shy on raw ehp to be used in real combat i think enough gridcpu to spare for either a lse or 8001600mm plate would be good for them assuming it doesnt throw off the rest of their balance too much
im thinking more speed to negate dps coming in t1s arent ment to tank like t2s so they shouldnt have comparable tanks like t2s but more speeed and agility would mean theyre more suited to light logistics work with a faster fleet type
it isnt even that there are many high sec systems that are nearly empty or empty people complain about being crowded while sitting in a mission hub or market hub they dont get the term hub attached to them without a reason i support the removal of the current mission system to be replaced with something more dynamic like incursions are but even more than that where you have to travel around a bit accept mission undockwarp shoot something release drones salvageloot dock complete mission rinse repeat it is no wonder people have this automatedthis would spread out the population a bit more it would also force people to leave their pocket of space and encounter other parts of eve that is a good thing
posting to confirm that this is an original idea
fi thread
that would be a natural development for a race designed to fight hoards of missile ships unfortunately eve doesnt really follow logic in terms of its ship design look at the amarrian which specialize in cap draining but whoses main enemy use capless weapons
agreed but the idea here would be a to produce a rockpaperscissors kind of counter for each type of weapon so even if for some odd reason it is the amarr destroyer that specializes in fielding a deflective chaff module the point is to have a specific partially effective counter to each main weapon type logically this would mean gallente having an antimissile boat minmatar having an antilaser boat caldari having an antihybrid boat and amarr an antiprojectile id submit that drone counters dronepartly this would function as antigank should miners have buddies willing to fly and protect them but i think it would be interesting from a tactics and intelligence perspective if you learn youre going against a drake blob bring a line of antimissile destroyers to the party your scouts say lasers you bring the disco ball launchers etc
there is an obvious problem to this suggestion dont get me wrong i like the idea hypothetically at least i always like the idea of new ship roleshowever they would be serving the function that logis serve now anyway all your doing is nullifying some incoming damage which is exactly what logis do except these boats wouldnt be able to repair the ships to full hp after the battle was done so who would use the antiweapon systems no one they would just get a logiin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
lol anti missile chaff shooting dessies just dont fit well into the game mechanics however you could ask for ewar dessies that essentially do the same thing tracking disruptors effect all turrets and soon missile too so make a td dessie and you suddenly have your aegis dessie
except that logistics cruisers act after damage has occurred rather than preventing or diminishing it in the first place the difference could mean surviving an alpha strike or notthis new role would be actual defense as opposed to postattack repair command ships and battlecruisers can do this today in the form of resistance buffs however command ships are both skill and resource intensive and battlecruisers more often than not serve in an attack role logistics cruisers can help with cap transfer to support local rep but if you have logistics cruisers you usually dont bother with local rep and this is still an afterthefact measure rather than true defense destroyers could fill a niche of cheap nearly disposable fleet support to protect against alpha strikes while allowing even lowskilled players to be very valuable beyond tackle or baitim actually suggesting this for tech 1 destroyers not a new tech 2 ship although a t2 destroyer other than interdictors wouldnt be too bad either
okay but a logistic ship can have the same effect by having reps on something before the attack begins if the effect these new ships have were to be effective without targeting your allies eg over the antiweapons range 50k or something then there were would be a big enough difference in my opinion how then would the ships mod decide who to protect and who not to only those in fleet by standing by corp or alliance i do see another problem though a fleet of these ships could be used to make a fleet completely invincible to any fleet smaller than it there is a partial solution to that of course it would be good to see the ships mod shooting projectiles out of space without collaboration ie they randomly choose a projectile to shoot at this would mean that the more ships you had that did this the more likely they were to be shooting the same projectiles ie negating some of their effect which would mean the more of these dessies you had in a fleet the more likely they would be to end up shooting the same targets and wasting their effect it would also mean the bigger the enemy fleet ie the more projectiles coming the less likely statistically they would be to shoot at the same projectiles as each other it might actually scale quite nicely it would give small fleets more effect against big ones and big ones less effect against small ones and so on and so forth that is only a small fix to the problem though i still think they would be difficult to balance in numbersthere are a lot of concepts to be ironed out im not giving my support to this thread quite yet but neither am i dismissing itin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
that could be one way to do it but that involves targeting each enemy and disrupting them as opposed to covering a friendlyit doesnt have to actually have a chaff effect im just relating that to something we know in warfare today from the scifi aspect it could be a temporary localized attracting warp shunt that causes incoming fire to bleed or disappear into subspacethe other interesting thing about this would be that it would make position somewhat more important in fleet composition as proximity to lineoffire would factor into the effectiveness of the protection this might mean that there would be a use for formations though those would be really tough to make fun please do help to refine the idea or point out weaknesses im not proposing that my ideas get implemented exactly as written but rather to have ccp implement the role true defense make it cheap destroyer hull and have an impact on fleet mechanics and composition antialpha antiblob antigank perhaps this ought to be moved to the features  ideas forum
there are already ships that perform the roles youve mentioned aside from the missile defense shield the electronic warfare hulls and their t2 variants provide the target suppression you want a missile defense destroyer is a neat concept but would be under utilized as no one with a bit of sense uses missile ships in serious fleet pvp theres probably a use for them in pve but the existing pve content is already trivial enough as it is
i want to hear what you guys think about the ideaboth this proposed system and the simpler system

oh dear god are you stupid this has nothing to do with afk cloakies i feel like im banging my head against a brick wall here i see you trolling in every cloaky related thread if your trying to prove a point at least try and prove it intelligently your just making yourself look badin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
your rightit doesntbut the fact of the matter is it will have something to do with it becuase you mentioned cloaking device and the first thing every tom  and harry will think afk cloakercontradiction yesbut unavoidable paradoxand yeshe is that dense stop the evemail spam

thank you everybody who posted an argument even against my proposalsome other people cant use their brains or are unable to communicate they lack the ability to understand what a proposal is and to have a discution it s their age for sure they should try to give an argument that supports their view and as we know attacking the poster instead of bringing any argument to oppose what has been posted is a sign of lacking argumentsthe proposal is to turn empire into 00 or low sec except the npc corps that would lead to equal rules for all it would be a good step against griefing and bulying newer player the war mechanings right now force the playstyle of the attacker to the defender it also leads to easy kills a wannabe pvper decs an indy corp knowing the indy cant fight back a real pvper fights in 00 or low sec if someone wants to pvp the low sec and the 00 is right next doorsupport my proposal to achive a real new gamethinking new players leave now more than they would leave in this scenario they would be safe in a npc corp and almost every industry guy would have pvp skils or a pvp altbe nice stop trolling start arguing
oh look a pvper who doesnt know that empire is about pvp as wellas you said eve is about pvp that includes the miners and missionersalso why dont you wait and see what ccp has for us andor screws up with their new war dec and aggression stuff
the proposal is to turn empire into 00 or low sec except the npc corps that would lead to equal rules for alloh well you know i would be with you in that but from what i ve read they wanna do something bad more bad thia is my proposal instead of waitng maybe they read and think about it i dont expect them to do it but maybe gives them or us too some new ideas
just moving or orbit all the time would not help because his cloak is disrupting the space around maybe 01 aubut your idea with the fuel is a nice idea too its nice to see who is posting  u all have just some npc corp characters  and i would like to make a bet that the most of you how dont like it are in this business  and not afflicted  i make just a supposition and when this topic is some topic that is discussed most of the time as some of u say think about why 
about why  because we want to kill afk cloakers but afk cloaking is risk free just asking why  why risk free a playtype in enemy space when everything other movements there is not risk free 
what a new and interesting idea that has never been proposed before im sure the developers have read your post and are all over your idea
docking up is risk free i want to roam through red space and kill everyone afking in a station until i can do this you cant kill someone whos cloaked
really  try risk free docking up when station bubbled and enemy fleet are there and you are not in a cloaked ship and warp there
if you were dumb enough to wait long enough for them to get set up like that then yeah if youre paying attention and just dock when theyre two jumps out then wheres the risk
well this post is popping up quite often so mayby something should be done about itif the mechanics would be perfect there would be no whiners now would there
i heard that some people need to sleep cant believe it but read it somewhere in the inet its scarring me
right i cant find so many topics about ganking or something like that every tactic had a counter tactic but afkpermacloakingattackashipeverydaywhenitisalone notand dont start again with stupid answers like bubble all have a fleet 247 online and protecting everyone put 500 shuttles around the gates and wait there with cloakys 247 too blabla we are the biggest all other are kidds blablathe most of u not even had the courage and post with there main character so how cares what you say or think momy the forum is scarring my and im afraid that someone could know me so i post with a alt all the time  puppies but bttthe part with the fuel is a nice idea and would make a new part in the market the fuel could be some pi product that is not used so much atm
if some people want to go sleep go and sleep and do not use afk cloakingafk craps just eat server cpu times and wasting server resources for nothing wanna go sleep  just do it without eveor you read it somewhere in the inet too sleeping necessary for afk cloaking  you scarring me
there is already a tool to use against afk cloakers its called a standing fleeti dont particularly like afk cloakies but neither do i dislike them i have never thought they are a problem guess that just comes from being in decent corps and alliancesin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

its absurd that the lp store only lets you do micro transactions when some players are earning millions of lp weekly if each conversion was of higher value as you went up the lp store then itd be fine but for a great many lp stores the highest conversions can take just a few thousand lp obviously this makes converting for example a million lp a massive amount of pointless clickingsimply add a multiplier on the lp store next to the convert button so you can do x conversions with a single click this is a basic interface improvement and should be simple

so i heard about this lockbreaker module at fanfest and have been thinking about it in detailish so the idea behind this is trying to break up large blobby fightsso here is my idea scrap the module and add it as a mechanic that a ship cannot be locked by more then 40 or so ships this would stop 2000 man fleets saying primary this and shoot and would break into lots of small gang engagements so here are the key points of how id think it would workthis rule would only apply to sub capital shipslocks from within your fleet donUFFFDt count in the 40 totallock total at 40 would allow small gangs to all get on a mail if it isnUFFFDt a huge fleetthe target painter would be changed to also allow 1 lock on a target making itfar more useful as ewarnow im sure there are things i have not thought of and im sure there are exploits would be nice if anyone could point out the problems and fill in the gaps if possible but i hope this would make the game far more tactical and interestinglooking forward to all your raging
im sorry but common sense says your idea is beyond stupid sorry but its true i mean for crying out loudin a role playing sensejust visually seeing the target and firing at pointblank range begs the questionare you really thinking this through or you just raging over blobs stop the evemail spam
i really dont understand what point your trying to make drake but no i donUFFFDt hate blobs i would just like to see battle a little more complex and diverse rather then parking up and shooting at each other with 2000 maelstroms you still have huge fleets they just couldnUFFFDt all shoot the same thing making it more chaotic and opening up new avenues of combat tactics i would hope at least anywayid just like to add that even if this isnUFFFDt the way to do it all im trying to achieve with this idea is smaller engagements within the two opposing large fleets everyone knows small gang fights are more fun and if we could split these larger fights into several smaller fights id think that would be a change for the better
a while back someone posted the idea of sensor glare basically saying that the more people targeted a single ship the longer it would take to target it had the obvious flaw of fleets selftargeting to increase lock times making a sort of passive ecm that would make fleet fights even more tedious however it gave me an idea that i never posted but remembered when i looked at this threadwhat if every weapon system that was activated on a target caused its signature radius to drop a small percentage and im talking maybe 05 or less small the premise is this simply targeting someone would not create the sensor glare but the weapon turret launcher ecm module whatever would for the duration of its cycle every offensive module would have this effectthinking it through a 20man gang even with 8 turrets each would drop the sig radius by 8 100 battleships would drop it by 40 youd get a 100 drop at 250 8turret ships so obviously there would need to be a stacking penalty or hard cap or a number smaller than 05the actual numbers would of course be set by ccp and tested thoroughly on sisi for balance but im rather fond of the idea it creates real penalties for mindless orbit anchor shoot primary fleet behavior by actually reducing their damage output not just their lock times
by that logic ignoring the op it would decrease snesor lock on timeglare only means its more visibleharder to ignoremaybe harder to target other ships in the background but even then thats reachinglikening to get a few hundred people to get laser pointers out and paint one targethow would that make it harder to find it more like bloody easy at that ratei get what your talking about and the ideabut ccp themselves have made it very clear at fanfestthey want thousands of players fighting it out in one spacenot dozens stop the evemail spam
first offyour ignorance is showingthe reasoning is for tacticsalpha damageetcif you cant handle the heatthen get outsecondly your proposal is beyond the point of rationalityyou want to stop blobs well your better off proposing spacial distoration to the massive numbers of subspace drivesreactors or something at that ratebetter than the drivel you came up withat least i can get behind thatand actually support it but all i see is whaa whaa i hate blobsyes im in the cfci cant help the fact they have a great sense of tactics and actually endorse avoiding of cap use if at all possible from my tiny little peep hole granted but even then stop the evemail spam
i dont know if youve been in fleet fights but its not uncommon to have 10 logistics ships to rep up people the biggest reason you see large groups of ships primarying 1 target is they need to focus fire to overcome logistics anything that limits how much you can focus fire needs to also limit how much logistics a ship can receive toosensor glare is a fairly neat idea imo to balance it the ship getting locked by everything should also receive the glare penalty now if your fleet mates all lock up some logis to prevent it from being primaried that logi becomes less effective at locking other ships too leave ewar immune ships immune to sensor glare ie triage carriersthe only way this could be taken advantage of is everyone might lock the fleet booster but i dont think this would be op or even all that problematic
well i did think of people locking up the logi to make him immune which is why i suggested that locks from within your own fleet wouldnUFFFDt tally in the 40 lock max per ship however i like the other idea much more then my own with the reduction in signature radius per offensive module it scales well with the number it being such a tiny percent and would encourage people to avoid the calling primary style of fcing when in larger numbers which is really the target market anywayalso drake is trolling hard
stop trying to take sand out of the box some of us happen to like large fightsalso post with your main
nope not supported mining barges are working as intended simple dont afk mine dummy if you see red in your overview gtfo
i could see giving mining bargest a bit more ehp the hulk is basically a 300 million isk money piniata that takes 4 t1 fit destroyers in highsec to kill or one random dude in null  lowsechowever id do it by moving them to an armor tank take away some of the midslots give em more lowslots maybe a little more powergrid and cpu for the extra tanknow with armor tanking they have to choose between fitting a proper tank and fitting mining yield boosting mods risk vs reward because you just know there will be some dude in highsec with half as much ehp as everyone else and mining laser upgrades in all his lowslots and hell explode spectacularlyas for the rest of this guys post it just sounds weird and unnecessaryi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
not supported sorry if anything rorqual becomes the mining barge and all previous mining barges become exhumers
well i think ore indys should just lose there tank altogether and be even stronger at just mining then each empire should get a t2 cruiser based off the logi hull that dose combat resource gathering the you have your strait indy ships that use strip miners and eat rock super fats and you have your tanky ships with some dps for hostile areas you devalue no mods as t2 and meta regular mining lasers would be wanted for the t2s and strips for the ore ships
read the subject reminder means reminderccp want to get rid of tier they have to work on all ships mining barge industrial includedsure mining barge work as intentedwho fly a procurer aka tier1 mining barge who fly tier 12 frigate and cruiser again who fly a tier 1 industrial again what is important is to apply the same balancing philosophy to all ships in eve the truth  i really dont give a  of what ccp will do to balance ships i really dont care about my own proposal it is just funny to see the immediate no i was expectingdo you realise that ccp might change all the ships we know in this process 
i will crack for you my friendthe role we can found in the dev blog about ship balancing are only for combat shipsnow try to find terms to designate a role for each industrial and mining barge you cannot because they forgot them using industrial ships as the basic trashtwo main thing in balancing ship  removal of tier  roles for shipim happy to remind you the basic of the incoming changes
first offim not your friend mr nooblet carebearsecondlyim not laughing anymoreyou have serious issuesthirdly dont give a  what ccp will do well gee golly whiz guess thats thread ccp will change what is necessary and im pretty damn sure it will have nothing to do with you stop the evemail spam

let me rephraseccp will make mistake when balancing ships and i dont care because they are taking the right direction we will see a lot of iteration before the release of the extension in winter probably a nooblet carebear like me will have nothing to say about it and i wont i will gladly accept all the change good or badif i post in the assembly hall it is because i want to draw attention on industrial and mining barges as spaceshipsno one pay attention to them in term of balance because they are not combat shipsmany voices are coming from the highest noble forum spacefighter rejecting anything related to industry internet spaceship is a serious business and industrial and mining barges are spaceshipseve is a living creaturepvp is the bodyisk is the bloodindustry is the heart
mobile cyno jammer modulei propose the development of a mobile cyno jammer that can be used during fleet operations to prevent cap ships from cynoing inhere are a few ideaslimited range skill based1 au per skill level5 au max cyno jam rangerestricted usecapital ship only moduleheavy interdictorsheavy interdictor v requirementdreadstitans maybe a dread in seige modecool ideacarriermothershipblack ops battleshipsthis makes sensepossibly a new capital interdictor dont like this idea or other sort of ships specifically made to deploy itrequire a cap buddypossibly make the cap usage high enough that it would require spidering to allow it to work if a carrier fit it maybe it would require 2 carriers to boost each other in order to be stable ive had numerous conversations regarding this and there seems to be a lot of support for the idea however i havent seen it discussed yet so figured id throw it out for discussionany additional suggestions are welcome
maybe we can combine the two ideas the attacker has to anchor a module in the system similar to a sbu this will reveal the cargo shipments and allow them to be scanned down then the attacker has to take down the cargo shipments to get the loot this will also solve the cloaky sb problem the defender can just destroy the sbu to reset the attack so to restate the proposal with that in mind1 attacking fleet anchors a moon mining blockade unit mmbu in a system a mmbu should cost 5m anchoronline time is 30 mins at this point any corp that has a moon mining pos in system gets a mail saying their operations are vulnerable to attack2 once the mmbu is online the moon goo cargo shipments mgcs are revealedspawned and can be scanned down i still believe they should have a reasonable amount of hp 5 mil ehp there will be no static defensesnpc escortetc just some structure in space3 defense can form up and take out the mmbu 1 mil ehp to prevent the attack once it anchorsonlinesboth the mmbu and the mgcs will generate killmails mmbu should have a lifespan of lets say 2 hours at which point it will collapse and vanish a little bit of thought will have to be put into the timing windows for the spawns ie it should not be possible to steal from the same moon twice within a set period of time eg 6 hours perhaps even add a restriction to prevent multiple mmbus from being anchored in the same system within a 6 hour period also need to consider timezones this method should be viable and equally profitable at all time zones and shouldnt favor the first tz to do thisthoughts i believe this addresses most of the concerns with the mechanics brought up so far the cost of the mmbu will discourage smaller moonsoperations from being targeted both the attackers and defenders have tangible targets that generate killmails
i was just going to ignore this thread and hope it went away on its own bad ideas dont hang around long unless the thread owner is battling on mercilessly without thought for the amount of support theyre getting which is what your doingthis idea is a massive massive change that would have huge gigantic game changing consequences ccp isnt going to pay any attention to this thread and frankly they shouldnt something like this would also have to be the primary focus of ccp for an entire expansion cycle to ever get completedno one likes the idea and even if they did it wasnt going to happen anyway let it diein the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
thanks for the feedback
so currently in game whats to stop a player with 10 security rating from getting in a pod traveling to a high sec system buying a ship with a smart bomb and camping it outside a station yes concord will show up and blow up the ship but the same player can simply warp to the next station wash  rinse  and repeati love the sandbox idea i really do but when the bully can come up and repeatedly knock down my sand castle it gets very discouraging very fast especially to new players why have concord at all they are always a response to known criminals causing problems but never impeding them from repeating those actions to me this is nothing like real life imagine if the cops simply followed bad guys around and stopped them after they robbed  killed someone its good that they are always caught but why not restrict them from causing problems in the first placemy proposal was to simply enact some real consequence for negative actions in the game the security status is already there why not use it for somethingi would love to see no passport system and simply have the restrictions based on security status but that would be unbalanced in the game and needs a countergo online and watch some youtube videos of people ganking new players in starter systems things like accidentally taking loot then offering it back and oh that concord message is just a popup they trick new players by acting nice then utterly destroy them if you really like this game enough to play and defend its sandbox environment would you recommend it to friends as it is now or would you spend time teaching them how to play before letting them try itmichael
you just lost what little respect you got from me stop the evemailUFFFDspam
eve is hardalso dont sign your posts tool
i would like to hear some actual feedback if i could not just a requote of the entire comment above with a single line of nothing usefuli see this as changing nothing for highsec players and adding both income and risk to lowsec players that want to venture into highsec
i gave you actual feedback you simply ignored itthe fact remains that there are actual consequences to loss of sec statusstanding in the game right now your approach is at the same time too heavyhanded and too beneficial to the gankers since they can make themselves safe in highsec by getting a forged passport and theres no reason for it to be in game at allyour idea messes up the sandbox that we have right now
you have no business making ideas for a game you do not understandfeedback is wasted on youi suggest you play for a couple of years before you propose changes that dramtically affect the game stop the evemailUFFFDspam
give us the option to have more than one preset orbit and keep at range distances depending on what i am fighting i may want to orbit at different distances same goes for keep at range right clicking or right clicking and typing the new ranges during a fight is horrible it would be nice if we could set differerent colors like red for the longer range setting and green for the nearer but that doesnt matter much if this was already proposed please link it make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve

im looking for something thats defensive ewar is not its offensive which is why youll get taken out by concord if you jam a target before they fire on you the kind of ship i imagine would target friendlies and activate modules on friendlies not on foes ewar frigates oddly enough would be a good counter to such a destroyera ship of the sort i envision could literally intervene before battle without being actually aggressive as opposed to shoring up whats left after the initial strike
say a logistic ship has reps going on a friendly to the tune of one million shield points every two seconds ridiculous but this is merely for the sake of illustration the friendly has 5000 ehp an alpha strike hits the friendly for 5001 points the friendly explodesin the case where the friendly is protected by this new kind of ship  module what would have been a 5001 point strike turns into a 3500 point strike still a big deal but not gameover the module protects the targeted ship it is activated on in other words you do target a specific friendly and protect that shipthe way i saw it closer proximity to line of fire or to the protected target was what would prevent i win fleets if one destroyer is protecting two ships it will be less effective protecting one than the other because shot angle now matters in the equation an enemy fleet can simply target ships they have a better position on also a webbing frigate becomes deadly for the the protected ships as it can prevent the destroyer from maintaining position until the destroyer pops it it is a destroyer after allthis creates some fairly new dynamics for fleet fights i think and has enough natural counters to prevent invincible fleets used well it could prevent straight blob grinds and require better tactics i couldnt say what effect this has on ccps hamsters although id hope the calculation would be simple enough to make it not too onerousbesides in a fleet battle destroyers should outnumber battlecruisers battleships and cap ships
those actually exist as well theres remote eccm versions of everything but target painters
how does eccm reduce incoming damage on a target
i think it could work if done right but i doubt it be possible without serious work
but thats why ccp devs get paid the big bucks they hopefully figure out ways to implement the feature without making it a massive ordeal hopefullyany additional problems with the idea itself
because sov 00 is a much much more complex system and cannot be fixed in any way that would be as simple as showing some love to losec
makes sence if both systems come into eve at roughly the same time then they both have my full supportif they were both included then most of my concerns are acounted for
every corporation has shares these shares can be given to corpmates why not sell these shares in a market why not call this marketa stock market hmmm players buying and selling shares of major ingame corporationsplayers actions affecting not only the outcome in a pvp battle but also the price of their corporations stocks just a thought
set up a website and run such a service theres nothing stopping you
why not set up a website because the game lacks the infrastructure to ensure transfer of isk for stock as stocks cant be included in the contract system include stocks in the contract system and a website could be created1 for op i have often felt the game needed more ways to make more use of the stocks
well we would need more or less a stock market if we think about the stocksmainly they are used to lock down assets and remove afk ceosso if you want a new stock system it would need a complete makeover and an actual stock market where corporations could enlist stocks would be traded and so oni would actualy like to see something like this tought the ability to manipulare or miss use of the market would be something that ccp would need to think about but it would be fun in a wayseeing stocks from alliances and how they would flucktuate or something like that dunnointeresting idea in genereal
making a public stock option1 supportedsystem would need and overhaul but i can imagine ccp finance guy could come up with something rather interousting and plus on top it it could be away for some the current isk to leave the game cause face it some corps and allaince die and thus their stock prices would die with it and isk would leave the game i like this thought alot better then raising taxes through out all of eve cause there is risk involved with this you could get lucky and make a ton of isk to it would bring a whole new world of politics into the game as will
the important question here is why did ccp not think of this idea has my full support although itd be nice to get the old flavour names back too some of us miss them
its one more item on a hundred things they are looking intotechincally its therejust not something to be sortedps i use evehq anyway  stop the evemail spam
total supportedbuy eve time on the big screen tv in station to will advertise your corporationalliance can be done via iskplex think about ccp the money you could generatesecondly advertising on concord billboards in high sec place name on products built by corporations so if i build a rifter it will say built buy teshania if i built it with as a corporation job it will say built by aliastragallente federation also it will skin the ship with the corperationallaince logo go if you want to trade mark a logo charge us 1 plex for every 3 months and the ship skinning is free every time we build something this is a world of corporations trying to make a living by providing some form of services with inside your sandbox gives us ways to advertise outside of the forums and spamming different chat channels
stupid  this is your best argument you terrible troll  you are a noob who need afk sound alarm and other idiotic things because you cant watch a ship and dont see when decloakedqand you talking about inteligence when you cant realize simple thing your ship uncloaked or notlol man better if you never post again and read the arguments again not just your crap answerdont lie everyone see when the ship is not in cloak that is not truth and just an camera zoomed out alibieveryone see it when looks at it onto the cloak module active cloak module have green flashy effectand no not need afk alarmif some one afk not need pay attention from sound alarm so not need cloaky alarm play or not cloaking away from game if use not just one client use window mode and will see what happen with shipeveryone know afk cloaky shipsterrorizing another peoples without play and with risk free because they not know the cloaked ship types and they dont know the user active or notand other one standing fleet not solve this problem because eve has so many system and inpossible to defend all system and a good pilot can kill the ratting ships with the npcs realy fast within 1 minute and when a fleet jumping from other system or warping from too far away because that is more than 1 minutei know because i killed many pilots with my main when they had standing fleets in system

answer me this how often do you currently find and decloak the afk cloakers that you so detestif you say anything besides never then i have to wonder why theyre so scary and if you never decloak themwhat will they gain from having this alarmthe lack of critical thinking in this thread gives my headache a headache
its like the old addage if you dont have anything useful to say dont say anything also an audio notification of your cloak failing just makes sence its really just a ui thing after all if you consider the audio to be part of the ui
1 buti would prefer it see it as more of a type of contract system where we go need xyz of minerals the corp members click a donate to project button and it subtracts form the total starting xyz and shows what is still outstanding then you can view 
agreed contract system makes much more sence
this would make mining for projects completely easier and reduce the amount of headaches us industrialists get 1
if subcaps couldnt hurt a titan and titans crap on regular capitals it would be just as unbalanced as they are now i could probably agree that anything smaller than battleship class weapons shouldnt do much of anything to a titan but battleships should be the primary counter to titans

sensor glare just doesnt make sense as more ships acquire a lock each successive ship in the fleet should acquire it faster because the ships computers share informationthe real problems with blobs are the scale of incoming damage not the number of ships that acquire a lock reps cant deal with it because they repair damage already done youd need a new mechanic like say this
npc corp poster gives his valuable input on large scale nullsec fights
few things for thoughtlarge blobs are slow to put together and get moving to destination they are great at taking structures in space great against other large fleetsif you are a small fleet you should be faster then the blob and just stay out of its way small fleet warfare is great for shutting down enemy operations and disrupting their day to day businessso each type of fleet has their place and purposeif you are in small fleet warefare stop trying to face off with the big fleets get behind them and  with their daily operations i dont know like blow up their damn miners this will hurt them more then anything just saying
understandablebut lets be honestconcetraited fire on a indicated target is common sense in battle field tacticsespecially if said target is especailly difficult to eliminateyour never gonna get away from thatno matter how hard you tryyou may make it harderbut it will still be usedquite frequently stop the evemail spam
because grids make any sort of sense at all or fluid space or capacitor warfareim suggesting a mechanic that would achieve a specific effect and then making a pseudotechnical explanation for it so that ccp can explain it in the game lore since when do we expect eve to make perfect sensealso who ever said fleet ships share information ive seen no evidence of this
its called voice commsfleet broadcasts shameless smart assed remark snesor glare doesnt fit the bill as a name but i understand what your shooting forill sit back and wait for a better rendition tbqhop is a little too nuttyfar fetched for my tastes stop the evemail spam
no argument there and there would be ways to counter the effect specifically pointing a half dozen target painters at the primarythere are two things id like to see change in large fleet warfare homogenous fleet compositions and primary volleys every fleet fight ive observed in the past six months has been fought the same way bring lots of the same ship and shoot one enemy at a time i want to see eve become more rewarding for creative players and unique strategies
fair enough i took the name from someone elses proposal that inspired my idea
wj you need to think outside the box more whats to stop a 200 man fleet will split into 2x 100man fleets and then locking up the friendly logistics in your neighboring fleet or any other missioncritical ships they want to protect youre sug
shoot everything on the field at random and you wont be able to apply enough dps to break logistics reps though
no just noany antiblob mechanics should not be forced upon the players it should be some sort of weapon that enemy blob fleets are worried the other guy is carrying eve is famous for having thousands upon thousands of people involved in large fleet fights if this horrible idea was ever implemented it would kill one of the main attractions eve hassummary of eves last four expansions
agreed thats why i proposed a new ship role and new modules for active defense logistics are not active defense rep is reactive in the aegis destroyer thread more useful for prevention of alpha but could potentially blunt the blob
hey i never said it was perfect im just trying to offer up a more sensible idea that would have the desired effecti really think fleet diversity is a bigger issue in todays fleet fights swarms of identical ships should have more vulnerabilities than a properlybuilt mixed fleet theres a reason every good navy in the world today uses large task forces that use combined arms id rather see ccp focus more on encouraging fleets that make use of more types of ships as i believe that would encourage more tactical thinking and more frenetic fights
nobody uses 100 homogeneous fleets though the average alphafleet containes bs logis fast tackle webs ecm dictors hictors recons bcs command ships and maybe others anyone using purely one type of ship is going to lose pretty quickly
iUFFFDve been watching a serious decline over the past 6 years of expertise in this game itUFFFDs apparent that at ccp the developers are not properly assigning the right people to the right jobs itUFFFDs not doubt apparent that you have many capable and smart members of your company but somehow delegation of task is falling through this recent round of massive adjustment to titan stopgap fix proposals is just one indication that somewhere there is a flaw in how you delegate tasking there is no excuse for the developers working on a change first and foremost do not know the problem and secondly do not understand the mechanics needed to fix the problem surely there are better developers in those specific fields around that can be tasked those duties similarly as with any elected office popularity contest do not assure proper expertise of csm members a body of csm does not guarantee that all the members are adequately able to discuss the mechanics of the game which the players address to them and then transfer those ideas properly to ccpproposed changes to the csmbefore ideas ever get voted on by the csm committees are formed these committies are responsible for pooling player knowledge and resources and forming a think tank on an idea the committee then takes the refined idea to the csm and can cite what player resources they used if itUFFFDs a combat mechanics then a combination of many fcUFFFDs from empire to lowsec to 00 and wormhole space are pooled together if itUFFFDs mining then experienced people with credible records are pooled from each area if itUFFFDs alliance and corporation management then leaders of entities across the game are pooledthat way the csm is adequately proposing ideas that are a collective of relevant knowledge rather than unspecialized members throwing their weight around the csm can release these meetings with disclosure on who was part of the committee why they were justifiably relevant and the decisions that were then lifted up to the csm and ultimately ccp the playes used are disclosed so that self serving interest of player pockets cant be exploited example being elise randolf cant just committe nothing but pl and nc together wo the regular player base and csm seeing how hes stacking a committee for a singular interest iUFFFDve heard from countless csm members that to date their jobs and duties are pretty meaningless and this gives them a much more relevant and active role and expectationsproposed changes to ccpredesign your teams around proper developer knowledge have a dedicated core of developers that work in each different area and become specialized in that topic if someone is dealing with combat then every task they get assigned should always be somehow combat related this requires them to understand the flaws in that field they should not be working on industry or trade mechanics npcUFFFDs etc the same goes for empire lowsec and sov mechanical changesindustry and researchmarket activitesminingcombat mechanicsempire buildingalliances and corporationsetcthis means that anytime a fix or addition to the game has a mutitiered effect people from each field are adequately represented but someone from the combat division should not have hisher hands also in something that relates to mining this way your divisions can also focus their own gameplay activities on their specific task so that they can better examine the play and impact of changes they try to make i think if you combine the developer changes with the csm changes you have a chance to pool a lot of resources for true expertise and return to proper patch ideas this will hopefully avoid the UFFFDomg ccp wtf were you thinking thereUFFFD ideas you seem to be coming out with that make the players question your competence there is no reason or excuse why the developers cannot see some of the insanely obvious flaws in their ideas that have become more and more frequent over the years after all if youUFFFDre designing the game shouldnUFFFDt you be experts shouldnUFFFDt you at least be able to see the obvious wtf bad ideas im sorry but you cannot tell me that somehow these developers should have their hands in so many cookie jars of gameplay no player in game has that kind of understanding of all mechanics theres just not enough time in the day find the best solution not just someone who did this for a while some time i mean  ive mined in game before but theres no way id call my self gods answer to mining but i can certainly think of players who would fit that label
i think someones butthurt that his titan is getting nerfedyouve got this big long rant questioning ccp and the devs and your one solid point in the whole thing is that the titan nerf isnt being handled the way you feel it should the rest of it is just a rant with no basis in reality

lol cloaky frigs are already fine ambushers just uncloak six seconds before coming out of warp
youre doing it wrong go make some popcorn this should be fun
or just use a sb role bonus 100 targeting delay after decloaking
dont they already get a bonus to that by definition of the covert ops cloak stop the evemailUFFFDspam
i stand corrected good siro7goes to make some popcorn stop the evemailUFFFDspam
no the covops cloak has a 10s recalibration time well 6s at cloaking 4 which is required to fit the things no other covert ships have that role bonus though the blops has a no targeting delay after decloaking role bonus it cant warp cloaked though
tbqhand yes my combat record is subparbut i have flown sb ops extensively in my days of whsthe time dleay is not that big of a dealbut i guess people are a bit quicker on the drawnow the other thing to keep in mindspace bombs dont need a target lock to throw a bomband by the time you toss your bombyour either commitedor gtfo modeby the time you lock on to someoneyour stuck there as they likely have you targeted and thusyou cant cloak stop the evemailUFFFDspam

thanks for the inputi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
great idea i too am moving my mission running around and the shuttle leapfrog back and forth is tedious to say the leastsmall improvement  suggestion add a new option called secure for travel  similar to repackaging but just secures the ship for travel in a envoyclass ship hold this would require a component to used like a framework for each class  size of ship they would be simple t1 gear that can be made anywhere but would add some cost to the whole operation and would be sold and traded each envoyclass would have a separate bay for holding collapsed frames even make them take damage per usage so you need to either keep stock or a blueprint handy to make more maybe a t2 variant with a password lock so you can secure a rigged ship password it then contract it for travel but keep it password locked so the chance of theft goes down options a frame locked ship cannot be entered with a pod so even if the ship pops out on destruction it cannot be boarded this also opens the options for trading  swapping rigged ships in space still need a station  pos to get into it but can be dropped in space and unless someone has another envoyclass they cant pick up the ships a t2 frame locked ship will only reveal what class of ship is inside no other detailsjust my 2 cents

drake swarm is an aberration that functions solely on the fact that we can dump three full fleets drakes into a system smaller fleets rarely see missiles being used as anything but secondary weapons to fill a highslot you couldnt put a real weapon in
this would not just be an antimissile platform the idea would be to have a damage counter for each kind of damagedealing platform excepting drones
i like this idea for when dust goes live able to defend the heavies from ground based fire would be pretty cool already they had an idea in templar one when a squadron of catalyst destroyers fire their guns to defend the moros tho a new ship class would be quite neat

having a public and private stock is possible there are companies out there that have multiple types of stock and they could serve different purposes in gameas an observation aside from another form of making moneywhich this clearly is a very cool way of doing so if it ever actually workedwhat would be the purpose of a public stock as mentioned currently the stock system is a way to deal with intercorporation issues like absencein reality corporations offer public stock as a way of securing additional capital to invest in some project now for the most part corporations in eve exist to feed some part of the war engine resource mining production andor war now reality you could argue is no different though we are perhaps a little less obsessed with war and theres a rather significant service sector in modern economies that simply does not exist in eve no spaceplumbers the thing is that if war is that much more constant and corporations and alliances rise and fall in power and existence at a rapid pacethe end result being the question how do you protect investorsthe obvious trend atmosphere or sentiment in the eve community would seem to be you dont anyone can lose everything just like they can in realitysort of there are plenty of government bodies that have oversight and regulatory power over stock exchanges because unlike eve governments are not made up of a collection of corporations what is more is that these it is in fact one of the most care bear environments you can imagine there are rules regarding insider trading stock manipulation fraud accounting principles required periodic disclosures i imagine that no one is going to want to actually do any of this work in game i mean there is a reason that accountants make so much money no one wants to do this in reality i cant imagine a significant amount of people would want to do it in game i could be wrong because there may in fact be whole corporations made up of cpas who might drop everything they are doing to just work the books but i doubt it that is not counting the whole question of what if they liecheat in reality there is jail and thats where you go in eve sure concord may shoot at you but if youre in 00 theres no applicable penalty the end result is that youd somehow have to ask ccp to automate thisthe other thing about reality versus eve is that corporations own things in reality while players functionally own everything in eve if the company that i work for goes out of business its assets would be liquidated and whatever money remained would be divided among its investors if a company is dissolved in eve there is really very little implication thereso ive written 2700 characters and if anyone is still reading you probably already get what im saying or you wonder whats your point well the point is that without some sort of safeguard history has shown us that people will bend the system until it breaks great depression and that some amount of regulation would be required to make this work the alternative everyone does what they want would likely lead to corporations making decisions to sell a whole bunch of stock then close up their doors and run off with the money the only other way i could see it working is if corporations would have to put up items for collateral on a semipermanent or permanent basis that would guarantee the fund to a certain degree but at that point youre really only guaranteeing that you might only ask investors to lose some percentage of their wealth if players do some financial acrobatics in game that are not possible in a stock market that we envision in our head this nyse of the starsdo you have concord fly fleets out into nulsec or lowsec to try to reclaim or punish players who cheat this system can they liquidate a titan who would buy it me pleaseand the reason why some protection of the investors is essential to this idea is basically that if the stock market is known to be the hive of only liars and cheats then no one would use it and though it might be in the game it wouldnt do anyone any good is there a simple or elegant solution that ccp could use as a sound foundation for this government has been at this for 400 years without creating much of anything that is either simple or elegant and that may not be saying much with how government operates but i think its probably a tall order neverthelessso i like the idea i just dont see how you could get it to work bonds are a much more viable option though there is potential debt and defraud involved there too
kattrina i hear ya that this system would be rather hard to put into place inside of this game for it just currently does not hold any real safe guards for those who would invest i dont truly see this as something would simply drop into the game either this would be more like a massive patch and put all their economists into overdrive trying to figure out how this wouldwould not break the game i total agree before introducing public stock options that there will have to be someway that when a corporation goes under that their assets would be liquidized and give first to the private investors then the remaining would would be split amongest the public stock options there would have to be regulations set fourth when going public that a  of all income for the corp would be set aside in a wallet they could not touch that would be a return to investors wallet or something to that effect i guess you could call this part a dividend pay out having corporationsalliance present quarterly earning even in our real life market there is huge risks investing so think this still would be a rather interesting system to attempt to put into playwhats needed more of draft of to implication this along with safe guards rules and regulations so it would become used and not destroyed over night by our rough edged population of eve
signed1 for a stock marketbut i suggest not using existing shares allow a corp to have another set of stocks that can be placed on the market current stocks are already integrated into things adding on top of them as they are would make matters worse as they exist now they are trying to do too many things alreadyperhaps allow a corp to issue shares after they register with some npc brokerage service they can issue up to 100000 shares for a one million isk fee regardless of the above a lot of data will need to be exposed to make a stock market viable in eve historical value dividend history top ten holders and their individual buy and sells over time how widely held etcnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt

i too would like to have a ship better than quite literally everything else in all of new eden
i think your missing the point iam not talking about fully opening up jove ships for new eden ccp at fanfest talked about new ships and new modsa  of stuff we have now comes from partly jove techrandom rare jove encounters would open up a endless part of the game and the story lines could go on for yearsfor examplewhs woke sleeperssleepers could  old enemy of jovejove tech that could drop from encounter  wormhole stabilizerdue to bubble type effect of a wormhole stabilizer only ship able to fit it could be a heavy indictorwormhole stabilizer effects for x amount of time drawback once counter reaches 0 wormhole entrance collapses due to mass stressmod uses high slot

not talking about i win buttons  just how new items are introducedjack try i know it may be hard but look at the bigger picture we have a form of this withincursions my proposal would just spice them and null up alittle bit breaking in down to most basic i can for you long time ago there was a event with a jovian shipbring back the jovain event as a way introduce new items new items that ccp are already looking atbut use mass huge fleets as a trigger for the random spawnwhs woke sleeperssleepers could  old enemy of jovejove tech that could drop from encounter  wormhole stabilizeri was trying to use this as a example on how it could fit as a back story
you remember how ccp did a couple of events a few month back the ones where they hopped into normal ships and ran around in circles like headless chickens until they died do you remember how much flamage occurred because of thatexample 1 why did ccp have to go into lowsec why couldnt they keep the event in highsec where most of the players would have had access to shoot themexample 2 ccp made a fleet that only a blob could take down its clear proof that ccp doesnt like solo or small gang warfareexample 3 omg something valuable dropped from the ccp ships this is a clear example of favoritism because only the biggest and most powerful people could kill them and claim those dropsexample 4 ccp should never have even come into the game its gamebreaking and antisandbox because they are introducing items that were not made and creating situations that are not organic froth froththe list of whines goes on and on and on and on back in the day when the population was smaller and less angsty this would have been a good idea these days anything involving events profit and ccp in the same sentence is likely to be met with some serious ear bleeding as a result you have to confine such events to purely rp fluff that has no gain or loss well some risk of lossalso no with the jovians i prefer to see them as something mysterious and untouchable there is also widespread understanding that ccp uses them as a plot device for expansions and explaining away bugsglitcheshappenings that generally dont make any sense

just a small idea i was ponderingccp no longer seems interested or is unable to provide artwork with each chronicle as they previously didif this is due to a lack of resources perhaps they could involve the fans instead ccp could put out specific details of art work that they feel will represent the next chronicle and players can get to work creating the next piece to feature in the story the author of the chronicle can then select the art work which meets the specifications

this has been brough tup many times in teh past so lets just keep it very simplemake implants player manufactured create new skillsets and uses for corpses with implantsbasically allow stations with medical facilities and poss with an appropriate module to have surgical labs that allow a player with an appropriate skillset biology nano surgery maybe a few others to salvage implant parts from corpses make implants require multiple parts to be built all of which have the possibility to salvage from corpses and to be made possibly from a rare source maybe even just in lowsec to give that area a boost so that youhave 2 methods of manufacture  either from slowly building up a stock of parts form corpses or from buidling from scratch probably using pi type materials along with regular onesbasically the implant industry should be player driven and it allows corpses a real use and adds a new skill tree and career path
yeah then faction implant price wouldnt be solely decided by null sec alliances
this would make eve universe into absoluet anarchy since gankers will kill absolutely anyone never know wether his implants arent worth much more than his ship are we so unless you intend to boost ganking into heaven it is probably not good idea
and what about the lp store isk sink we currently have we need more sinks not less
hesitantly supportedi very much like the idea of making pvp potentially profitable there are some obvious problems the isk sink loss for example which will need ironing out i will be watching this thread not if there is a  likihood of the implantimplant parts being accessable that is low enough to make suicide ganking unprofitable or simply unlikely to be profitable i wouldnt throw a perfectly good idea out of the window simply because some fine details are required

well its nice to know at least someone has had the same vision as me with chaotic fleet fights but this seems to be trending to a resounding slap in the face no to the idea
command ships people still use those when they can give better bonuses and stronger tanks with t3sthe biggest fleet fight ive ever seen ive watched quite a few but never engaged in any consisted of a big blob of drakes versus a big blob of maelstroms it was early on in my first ventures into lownull and i couldnt even tell you who the involved parties were i was utterly ignorant of space politics at the time these blobs made up probably 90 of their respective fleets thats close enough to homogeneous for me to see it as a problem
oh hell yesthere is always a costant demand for them command ships in the cfcfyi they are still cheaper than t3s floppie but you knew thatjust being a smartass ribs stop the evemail spam
yeah my abso was about half the price of any of my legions it also doesnt do any of the jobs as well its a lot of fun to fly but command ships definitely need some buffs to make them do what they should be doing
we definitely want more variety in fleet fights just not through nerfing existing functionality a more natural way to achieve this would be to model a militarys natural response to the problem change the capabilities of the fleet if the real problem with blobs is focused fire find a way to handle focused fire you must assume that you cannot directly alter your enemy except perhaps through infiltration and sabotage therefore reduce the incoming damage with active defense as opposed to reactive repair developing technology that would interfere or intercept incoming fire like an aegis destroyer or that could temporarily soak up some of the damage remote shield extender modules with a cooldown remote resistance amplifier modules with a cool down could achieve thisthe enemys response would end up having to be taking the defense apart in detail to increase the effectiveness of their offense mixed ewar and tackle packages become important depending on how the active defense roles are implementedim not saying that the fleet with the most ships wont still win if both sides bring a balanced fleet all else being equal the one with the numbers should win that doesnt need fixing but there should be more room for tactics to make a difference than there is todayas mentioned ive created a thread in this forum for those interested in the notion of aegis destroyer though perhaps it should be modified to active defense
amen to thatbut isnt an damnation more fun in fleetscourse an abso is kinda fun for small time fleets stop the evemail spam
what if a new mod like a damage control that prevents structure damage for 5 seconds after armor is depleted and the mod breaks doesnt make you invincible but gives logistics a change to get on youme personaly i hate changing things when we can just add more to the game
this idea is  ridiculousthere is a time and place for large scale warfare and creating mechanics that completely trump the ability to do so would destroy the gamealso if i had to take out a dckstar with 40 drakes id fcking hang myself
the ideas of forming committees for up and coming changes or proposed changes would be awesome at least if anything an open conference round table idea that you can log into and join these would be publicly announced and be held and lead by the csm they would be in charge of taking polls qa over the topic to properly generate and submit the ideas to ccp  yes this is ccp games and baby but we play the game and pay you to keep alive and fresh you opened the door to hear our voices by allowing us to vote in csm give them another tool other then us spamming the forums and praying for our voices to be heard make the csm work for their titleposition forming these action commites would greatly enhance their positions and prevent you from getting mobbed on the forums and face it no one csm can be a no it all in this game the learn curve is huge and ex termly dynamic

why havent we got this yet
excellent suggestions thank you so much i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i personally love this idea its awesome orca is just slightly too small and carriers well we cant have those in high sec let us see a tug that has say 700m3 worth of transport bay and we would be able to do alot more then what we are currently i also agree on the freighter iii skills let it work the same as the current ship maint bay with the exception of being able to launchtrade in space i like it
good input from everyone if only we could get dev inputi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i have a topic up on this forum for this same reason i too find a lot of difficulty in moving large quantities of ships around we try to move to where the action is on the map as the war front moves up and at one point dissolves but currently it is a pain to move we cant deploy battleships because sooner or later that needs to be moved too and thats far too costly to do by carrieri didnt want to introduce a new form of ship for this as indeed eve already has a lot of different transport vessels as it is instead i wanted to squat the problem at its core  the rigs if rigs were to be removable ships can be repackaged without loss and transported by readily available meansmy support goes to whichever idea lessens the load on moving ships around be it mine or yours
this
sounds like a solid idea but it does need polish as far as antimissile defense defender missiles work nicely for stopping incoming missile damage but what youre proposing would require major reworks new modules new ships and balancing for other ships to provide them a viable countermeasure to a whole fleet of these ships not gonna thumbs up this one yet but ill follow this idea
i like this angle quite a bit some level of groundtospace and spacetoground interdiction would be very cool it is something that we havent heard much about i would share the developers sentiment that without fully understanding the impact the unknown dust variable will have that it would be hard to create stuff in eve that lessens or negates the impact of the dust marines but creating new fleet support roles is always interesting it deepens the strategy
having more complexity for fleet fights is certainly one of the aims of this idearegarding counters to an aegis destroyer there were a couple of things i thought might work position and effectivenessfirst the limitations of positional requirements distance to line of fire and perhaps distance to protected target are factors in the effectiveness of the modules the closer the aegis destroyer is to the line of fire between attacker and protected target the more time the module has to intercept incoming fire hence the more effectively it places the countermeasurethe notion of reaction time also generates the second factor for effectiveness the closer the aegis destroyer is to the midpoint of the line between attacker and protected target the more effective the countermeasure is being too close to the attacker reduces reaction time being too close to the protected target reduces the space in which protective measures may be deployed the ideal position for an aegis destroyer then is midway between attacker and protected target directly on or very near the line of firenaturally skills at using the modules and the effectiveness of the modules themselves would also be a factor beyond that the effectiveness should also be proportional to the size of the weapons system in the same way that weapons system size affects ability to hit targets today incoming fire from a frigate would be nearly impossible to intercept whereas incoming fire from a battleship is much easier to mitigatecounters to aegis destroyersgiven that position and size plays so important a role in the effectiveness of the defense a number of tactics arise that would be effective against a large group of aegis destroyersfirst and foremost sniper fit destroyers and assault frigates could have a distinct advantage against aegis destroyers imagine a fleet composition as follows battleships command ships battlecruisers cruisers and logistics ships form the main fleet auxiliary tackle and ewar ships aegis destroyers protecting bigger ships including logis the attacking fleet would have to punch through the defensive wall of aegis destroyers in order to effectively attack the higher value targets they protect primary fire from blobs of bs bc or cruisers wouldnt be all that effective because the aegis destroyers are protecting themselves as well as logistics which can also lend support to the defensive wallbut aegis destroyers are vulnerable to sniperfit destroyers and assault frigates imagine using an initial wave of dessies and afs to punch a hole in the wall imagine also using tacklers to pin aegis destroyers to pull them out of position even better if we had another new module say a combat tractor beam that could be used by a tackler to pull the destroyers out of position we could have even richer sets of tacticswhile the initial wave of destroyers and afs are working to create a hole the larger fleet assets are maneuvering  to aim through that hole in the defense to start putting the hurt on the higher value assets of the defending fleetas you can see there are richer tactics maneuver counter target handling that would arise from the addition of these capabilities the role of wing command would become more important the role of logistics pilot would become more interesting rep the wall abandon the wall rep the assets runanother alternative given that range between attacker and protected target is important pointblank range with blasters becomes a reasonable countering tactic gallente buffplease help me refine the idea also i ask for your support
thank you all for your well thought out responses i agree it would take some effort on ccps part to put this into the game i hope they consider it
all this talk of anchorable modules and hacking and skills really strikes as an potential alternative method to take down active towers such methods shouldnt be necessary to remove towers that have to all practical purposes been abandoned by their ownersas a simple and stupid alternative if the tower runs out of fuel it goes offline as normal if it is not refueled in 7 days it is considered abandoned and unanchors along with all its attached modules and is free for all owners dont want to lose their stuff dont abandon it easyto counter the obvious metagaming answer of fueling for a single cycle sometime during day 7 to reset the timer if the tower runs out of fuel for a second time within the next 14 weekstbd it unanchors immediatelythe charters idea did give me another separate idea for giggles if you run out of charters the tower keeps running provided it still has other fuels however the corp gets a strongly worded mail from the relavent empire navy if the charters arent refueled within for example 36 hours the navy goes hot drop oclock on the tower
supportedhaving done precisely this in the past using google docs i can vouch for it being time consuming sitting there with a calculator tabbing up what each corp member has mined in an op having a 3rd party tool that is supplied by an api would make this so much easier i dont do this anymore having come to my senses and realizing mining other players is a more rewarding profession but this is still a good idea for those of us who havent come to our senses about the dullness of indy work yet
if you want to taste what this would be like from the indy pilots perspective jump out into sov null with no backup no scout no cloak and make your jump path back to safety no less than 50 jumps see how long you make it before falling to a gatecamp out there the 00 alliances will gladly deprive you of your ship and pod very quickly

i keep hearing complaints and discussion about jita specifically and its domination as a trading hub and the multitude of problems associated with all the congestion it brings as well as the subsequent naughty behavioursince the continuing evolution of eve appears to be in the direction of not making it too easy for immortals to conduct their various business interests i would point out recent efforts to eliminate botting not boffing and weed out exploits not expats as prime examplesimmortals like any species or perhaps especially humanoids tend to the lazy and in such will search for and root out any morsel of advantage to keep them ahead of the pack as such there must be different if not more aggressive consequences for violations of highsec regs for dying is not really a relevant punishment for bornagains as that bright light at the end of the short tunnel is ever so encouragingthe market which forces a great majority of traders to make the jita run is also the same lure for all illconceits even in the alternate reality known as earth cmon i know youve heard of it there are many regulations put in place to expand trade options and limit the congestion of too much trade in any one place  hence both a macdonalds and a burger kingtwo suggestions for broadening out the scope of the aforementioned troublesconcerns i think would go a long way to making the trading and transporting trades more dynamic are as follow even the ganking strategy would developadapt1 every system has a security rating for a reason adapt trading to these security ratings so only the basic items could be sold in 10 systems and each subsequent level decrease could sell only certain tech level stuff  this system of market levels would apply to everything pi mods minerals ships etc i leave it up to others to set up the specifics even lowsec can be brought into this  perhaps all things t2 are able to be sold in lowsec incl faction itemsthis doesnt stop salvaging in highsec either but it you attain a t2 item and want to sell it off to lowsec you must venture2every highsec station has guns same as gates but there doesnt appear to be any real defence of the space around stations from the nefarious except when a hostile action is commenced not that preventing a ship from going anywhere against their will is hostile not at all i only assume that there are computers on stations but if so that means they have memory like my laptop my ship and even concord makes use of such im sure one could therefore postulate that such memory could be put to good use in remembering those pilots who have ganked previously at that particular station or in fact with modern communication as seems to be the order any of same corporate stations those same station guns could simply open fire on any such pilot thinking they would return from rebirth to do it again  that would keep those dastards at bay say 250 km until they improved their corp station standing to be allowed near again hahwe have to remember punishment is supposed to act a deterrent if it doesnt then why have it at all as it stands right now its like an ingame exploit this will not end ganking merely adapt the strategies of those who like to just like the necessity to go produce isk so one can buy another ship this would make the consequences of ganking actions something to more to considerit works this way everywhere else in npc controlled space why not with this you lose enough standing with corp they dont want to deal with you you lose enough standing with concord you cant enter specific level systems you destroy enough ships from another faction ditto their navy takes an interest in you next time you stop by for a tourist brochure ganking in highsec needs to have similar scrutiny placed on it to bring such actions in line with everything elseotherwise titans and the rest should just be allowed back in to station sit

what youre asking for is limitations in the sandbox limitations in the sandbox arent good they go against the whole point of the sandbox
attitudes and snarkery aside theres a lot of great points being made here on both sides of the issue that being as i understand it how do we increase enrolment while protecting the uniqueness of the game and its structure as we know it or most of it as everyone has their own perception of how it could be made betterthis game definitely isnt for everyone and neither is any other game out there the one thing no one can change is each of our personal differences preferences and tolerances we all like different things we all come from different backgrounds have different life experiences education and environments we live in how can one form of entertainment be expected to satisfy everyone it cantas some have pointed out those whove been around a long time especially this game has changed over the years and new players have more training available to them than now than ever before still eve is a complex and multileveled universe the cartoon learning curve graph isnt totally off the mark while eve certainly has its flaws each opinion to their own it is still evolving and will continue to do so to both the admiration and condemnation of all those playerscitizens who agreedisagree with those changes sounds like most societies ive visitedyou will never get away from the fact that some people simply prefer the immediate satisfaction and adrenaline offered by superintense single point shooters or their favourite sports like basketball and hockey while others like ahem simulated golf about the only thing that drives me nuts is the sounds form thousands of onearmed bandits and the blearyeyed zombies slouched in front of them going through their preprogrammed onerous motions of plugandpull i know sounds a lot like miningbut its not and i digresstheres one thing that is pretty much universal though everyone likes a good story some read them some watch them on tv or at the movies and some even create their own while there are many who simply like to log on for pvp fights andor ganking eve is really about each citizen creating their own story and for a newbie that can be a terrifying prospect if they even realize it  one does need to get over the initial spaceships and lasers cool factor again not for everyoneits also been pointed out that there are many who dont quite get it who finish the tutorials and then sit floating wondering what to do next how to do it where to do it come to think of it sounds like my first date way backi myself am one of those who are self starters i dont need never have needed any help from anyone first thing i did after finishing my tutorials was to pick a fight with a bs me still in my ibis station guns intervened but i was sure i couldve taken him lol all things start from dreams dont theyi can understand several of the newbie complaints though one of those being about the missions the missions in eve have only one real purpose to gradually developpigeonhole your faction affiliation while providing you with a meagre means of increasing your wealth and experience perhaps a little too vague a goal for someone just starting out to grasp the significance of what those even mean never mind their consequences as you blindly step up the ladder whilst trying to avoid all those everpresent snake pits and gankerswhy is everyone shooting mesome of those missions are simply silly and were obviously created by bored staff who probably had a quota to fill each dayif only the missions had more substance like a story to follow no not one story many stories like those old baldurs gate games or for older folks even those old roleplaying books where choices you made changed the story you encountered these storied missions would give newbies something tangible to aim for figure out even get them learning how more technical or diverse options work within eve so that eventually they are ready to start creating their own story no longer timid wideeyed newbs but confidentwell more confident adventurerswe all have to remember while eve is a universe as expansive and sporadically developing as it is with lots of options and opportunities for even the crustiest old guard to take advantage of without new blood coming in eve will eventually stagnate itself and sadly cease to exist the game and the business model both must reinvigorate itself continuously for the benefit of us all and if that means making changes to help induct new pilots im all for itcheers
i think the views run the gamut from people 1who might not be able to find their way out of a paper bag  couldnt figure out how to find the next mission agent  2 those who thought eve couldnt be played casually 3those who were intelligent enough to actually do decent at pvp in eve but found there was too much downtime between fights the first group cant be catered to unless they change eve i mean they shouldnt dumb the game down so we get more mouth breathers the second and third group can clearly be catered to without dumbing the game down what is ccp doing for them it seems to me they are the people who belong in low sec and npc null the only changes ccp is doing for them is to faction war certainly faction war could be a great option for people who like casual play and pvp unfortunately ccp is making faction war more like null sec making it so there will be even more downtime between fights due to not allowing the militias to dock in the same faction war systems and less casual friendly over all make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
that link is broken now i will never know how to play giving corporations a reason to hire nubs is probably a reasonable goal how do you define newbies and how would it work thoughperhaps something that the 00 people dont realize is that for a lot of players factional warfare is kind of their tutorial a lot of these corporations exist with surprisingly indepth training programs for pvp environments now each factional warfare group is going to run things differently than a nulsec corp but fleshing out the experience in highsec and steering more players towards these factional warfare groups is actually something that would help players ease into the game over a period of months or years now some of them may never leave it granted but they arent hurting the game either to this end i think anything that hurts factional warfare is in fact bad for the longterm wellbeing of the gamepirate corporations and gate campers give the lowsec an often deservedly poor reputation you cant just throw a person into the most brutal pvp environment on the internet just like you cant expect to give someone a website that teaches them how to swim give them 2 minutes of video instruction and then drop into the middle of the atlantic going from highsec to lowsec in a few months is something only a few people are willing or able to do and frankly few lowsec corps care to help with either

having recently read another concord thread which was locked it did make me think of recent eventsnot long ago it was announced that there was an exploit called boomerang effect where some players were able to escape from concord punishment after ganking in highsec while i definitely support the removal of any unintentional exploits i do believe an opportunity was missed here for the addition of extra gamesmanship therefore id like to throw out the following suggestion for commentseverywhere in eve pvp is promoted whether that be in ship fights fleet fights faction wars sovereignty wars skirmishes and even market battles lame as that may sound alongside these epic endeavours exists the npc world of ratting missioning ded space wormholes and incursions it seems only in wormholes and incursions are the npcs given any sort of clout a darker shade of grey to the otherwise mundane rats most encounter okay lets not forget the sleepers concord on the other hand appears to have a carteblanche existence all their own they do naught but mete out punishment in an all too black and white autonomous unchallengable and imperious authority would it not make things more interesting if the concord paradigm was altered so that they were subject to many of the same rules as players are for instance if a player ganks another or does some other punishable action according to concord that player should be able to try to escape concords long arm of the law depending on where the action took place surviving the initial onslaught usually wouldnt happen but in event player could tank it that player should have ability to run and concord should be able to chase scan down etc but with no added bonuses that arent available to the highest skilled player they could have a programmed but adaptable routine for hunting prey and their ships should respond as any other npc or player could depending on scale of offence only so many ships would be brought in on hunt and they could only travel from existing nearby patrols taking the appropriate travel time to arrive thus leaving those systems with less ships to watch over gates etc concord would have the regular fifteen minute aggression timer to hunt down the perp otherwise the perp could escape with only a significant downgrade in hisher security rating perps wouldnt be able to access any station during timer and would be taking their own chance getting through gates this is probably no easy programming adjustment but it sure would make the interactions with concord much more dynamicthink of the possibilities
run a search before posting your ideasthis idea or something close enough to it was proposed not 5 days ago
why the  cant people read what was written the op didnt propose that blobs shouldnt be allowed he proposed that there should be a limit to the amount of primarying that is effective that doesnt mean that no one dies because the 10 logis can tank the primary it means the 10 logis have to worry about multiple primaries jesus  weptin a role playing sense there is usually a limit on effectiveness of numerous aggressions  in the 2d warship style eve is modelled on its called line of sight
whats the deal ccp how come my caldari frigates look like chewed up bubble gum the only ones that are remotely cool are the kestrel and the merlin and minmatar i feel sorry for them their ships look like they were put together with duck tape except for the rifter of course why do we only get 1 out of 5 that looks good shouldnt all the ships look appealing to fly in your 2012 fanfest presentation you said that you are revamping some ship designs in the upcoming inferno patch hopefully all of the caldari and minmatar will be redesigned we would like to fly spaceships like everyone else cough cough
cardari are suposed to look hightech and mimmatar rustyif they are gold or organic they would be ammar or gallenteeverything should not look like everything else not suck yes same no
how does it goin rust we trust
remove local problem solved
remove cloaking problem solved same stupid answer 
a stupid whine post deserves a similarly stupid answer
i actually agree with this i didnt even do the eve tutorials becasuse they were crap i googled everything thats not good for any mmo its gotten better but i would still direct a newb toa 3rd party website for tips wow does the game not teach people about the aggresion mechanics if not thats just  poorman thats bad
another bump for the new csm tho it seems this thread is doing well on its own
one problem with more npcs and having them exist more actively ie not disappearing offgrid and persistently in game is that this will result in increased server load i dont really think this is helpful though i do see some appeal in the idea i dont think it is bad so much as impractical and maybe counterproductivepresume these npcs suddenly start maintaining a persistent existence until they are blown up then consider that they could suddenly start carting around npc goods and redistributing them to various regional markets and consider they could also become player targets what does this gain what is the purposeaside from the joy of watching ais take flight in space there is no real purpose or benefit here that isnt moderately counterproductive to the game even if they could be optimized the server still has to track them and keep track of their cargo and even handle any market interactions they have if they dont have market interactions then they are just fluff without purposecurrently the npcs aside from concord and navy vessels just spawn and disappear nothing major and they only really exist for a short time on grid this is sort of the simplest form of ai available and generates the least amount of server load as a result of their existencepersonally i always found them to be a bit redundant and pointless perhaps there should be more traffic in space and maybe npcs should run around a lot more but it is not really necessary and these are afterall spaceships its not like they would be super common outside of military transport and trade usagereplace the jita statue with a luxury liner perhaps maybe i actually dont even recall having noticed the jita statue the one in amarr sure but not the one in jitatldr if it doesnt generate lag and involves some new civilian hull designs sure could add some flavor i wont deny that but if it is going to have some effect like the spamming of cans in space and cause the servers to lag then not really interested they removed mines and limited objects in space to 2 hours for a reasonzubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub
agreed i dont see why there are still items that exclusively come from npcs in our player run economy
i am all for lootable corpses in the same way invention worksget a corpse invention no implant no lootimplants t2 chance bases of retrieval t1 if succesful 75 w t2 the rest is fail it gives gankers the upperhand indeed and flying in a pod isnt so safe no more hessitant but supportive as well
i am proposing a market window tweak to high improve the market gameplayas many people use multiple accounts or even multibox i would like to see the simple improvement of making the market windows sub tabs to be able to set as single windows therefore seeying groupsdetailpersonal and corporation orders next to eachother for better workflow much the same way as stackable and unstackable chat windows also colortags for personal corp orders to would add alot
i like this idea either as an ore ship or as a faction specific ships why ore easier for our friends at ccp to make one ship than to have them make 4 or 5 im not abundantly concerned if the majority of people only trained one factional transport and there are plenty of other things of a nonmilitary nature that ore might have used this sort of technology to do but really its more that id like to see this sooner than later and sooner is 12 ships rather than a half a dozen1
ore wouldnt get involved in anything that could be remotely considered military operations and transport of military vessels would fall into that category and each factional group would select the group that is more involved in mass transittransport to get things goingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
wait i dont get it why dont you just get a carrier
additional refinements criticisms welcome
this is a fantastic idea in general since the general mood in eve is to let players work it out themselveswhatever it islet us advertise our very cool ideas to the rest of eve respectfullyps how does one advertise on the login screen
i was wondering is it the right place to discuss subjects like this  cause here i believe at best we only will have csm attention 
negative implants are there to provide an additional element of risk and choice
this proposal sucks
so are people who necro stop the evemail spam
no that is all
i wish its never going to happen though
minmatar can still look rusty without looking like theyre made of scaffolding and screen doors caldaris bulky and boxy is pretty much the opposite of a high tech look
i agree minmatar and caldari ships can be improved while still holding onto their cultural essence
i agree with these statements the primae doesnt do a single thing better in the pi department than any ship it is slow and bulky like a large industrial yet both of its specialty holds combined hold less than an iteron with no modules and gallente industrial trained to 1 new players are given a free industrial from the tutorial which is in every way better for all types of hauling than the primae is even back when they were given out a new player would have had more incentive to sell it than to fly it even though it looks kind of cool even its tank is badit has more powergrid than normal industrials but it has so few slots that its bulky design still ends up with less ehp than smaller and faster industrialsi think the following problems need to be addressed with the primae1 no purpose  its supposedly a pi hauling ship but it cant haulhowabout it requires the ore industrial skill to fly and each level of the industrial skill adds 2000m3 of space to its pi hold and its base value is increased to 4000 then even with the skill only at 1 you have 6000m3 pi space which is slightly higher than that freebie industrial you were given from the tutorial with meta 0 cargo expanders at skill 3 itll carry 10000m3 and 14000m3 at skill 5 it still wont rival industrials but its easy and potentially cheap and you can carry command centers around in it at no extra chargeid also make the size of the command center hold based on your interplanetary consolidation skill 1000m3 one command center per level of the skill so you can carry as many command centers as you can placethat wouldnt make it a good ship but it would make it an ok ship it would at least function as a pi ship and some players would definitely use it even if just to be using a limited edition shipeditanother thing that could seal it in as a newbie favorite would be if it had a way of refueling a command center launcher so that it could be used more often this way new players could potentially avoid the huge export taxes and instead just launch all their stuff directly into orbit
this is actually well thought out and i like the idea this would actually make it useful in the purpose in which it was designed thumbs up to you sir
first off why did you feel the need to necro a thread thatd been dead a monthsecond the primae doesnt need any changes because it already does what its supposed to do be a gimmick ship it wasnt really designed for pi work it was designed as a collectors item the same as all the other giveaway ships like the zephyr and echelon the reason that it has the pi label on it is that it was released as the christmas giveaway ship the same year that pi was released so it got labeled as a pi ship
if cloaks were fine why would it come up so often every module needs a viable counteri see this is your first day on the internet let me explain it to you there will always be whiners ccp was obsessed with incarna and ignoring stuff thats been broken andor imbalanced for ages we finally got them to refocus on the part of the game that actually exists but once in a while you still hear some idiot crying that they want more clothes to play dressup with their space barbies sooner people spent several years trying to get ccp to nerf gallente followed by several years of trying to get ccp to buff gallente no matter when they do its going to  someone off all you can really to is strategically choose who to  off

confirming that cloaked ships are supposed to be sneaking around in space they dont belong inwhat did you think cloaks were for being able to run l5 missions
theyre supposed to be an invisibility button not an invincibility button they need to have a counter like everything else
cloaked ships are not invulnerablethe fact you think they are is nothing short of your show of complete and utter ignorance of the facts stop the evemail spam
but they are near toa cloaky fly in your system when nobody is online maybe sites like evewho help himnow he is there makes a safespot somewhere in the space not reachable for someone elsenow we have that corpally that life in the space maybe lets take a normal corp with around 100 or 150 players all from the same timezone some have to work some have to sleep for a whileplayer abcf are indu chars skilled to indu and pithe play in the morning where other are working or sleeping or the come from the work play for a few hours and go offlinenow the cant do anything what should the do against a 2 man tenguloki cloaky gang waiting for someone to dock offu cant do pi without a hugh fleet against the t3 ships with remote shieldsupportlater the most part of the corporation is online around 50 player hac pilots t3 pilots ecm boots and everything else the bubble the gate stand around in ships but the cloaky is sitting at his safespot can check the online and offline times and the restbut why im explain that u wont understand that because u dont want to understandit is a fact the cloaking is to strong there is no counter tactic against them the can still be there invisible and near to invulnerable because u cant shoot what u cant lockremove the local sry but that is some of the stupids ideas against cloaks i ever heardmaybe u are a wh player nice life there because u like it but other dont  just the fact u know something is the problem no the fact that there is no countertactic against that when u see a ship that jumps to a wh and is cloaking on the other site u know it too and u have no way to find him same info same problemu can put him in the watch list now u have the same like a local u just have to check the wh 247so there have to work on that just why some npc corp characters are posting here it is fine i think the are players we talking here and the are afraid that the would have no chancer after some counter tactics it is notcloaking is nice to check the enemy scan out the system move without get aggresed hide a part of the fleet and many more but it is not for be a 247 treath for corps that havnt 10 players with counterships 247 aroundall the parts of cloaking are nice and the ideas here wont effect them just stand or fly in the same 01 au example for some time gives u the chance for a countertacticor when u have to use fuel u can do all u did before but not afk cloaking hours and hours in a system u have to fly out get new fuel that gives the systemholder a chance for a counterattack and u know when a cloaky is in the system he will aggress u because he cant fly around for hours with his cloak

heres something to add to this treadnaughthow about a sov upgrade for higher level systems there isnt anything that an alliance spends isk on at level 5 why not try a cloak disruption array sov  lvl 5upgrade  cloak disruption module  25 mi per daypos module  cloak disruption arraymust be active to disrupt cloaking devices within the systemaffects all cloaking devices within the systemthis would allow cloakyfags to camp systems not properly upgraded while allowing corpsalliances with the sov to protect against cloakers but itll also prevent the owning corporations from running cloaky operations within the system too it would have a similar effect as the cynojammer and upgrade that are currently in the systemwhat do you think of that trying to find a middleoftheroad solution for those that like that playstyle while making the carebears happy that they wont have afk cloakers sitting in the system on the side it would produce another isk sink for the economists in eve
ah nice idea too and is like the cyno jammer ideabut sov level 5 is a little bit high 4 is enough i think
the only reason im suggesting lvl 5 is to allow the cloaky mechanic for the 100 days needed before the module can be installed this would allow various reds to harrass the system with the threat of covert hotdrops for a sufficient ammount of time unless the alliance doesnt install the upgrade in the ihub by the options i marked it would mitigate the principle nature of a force recon to sneak into position undetected before lighting the cyno for hotdrop oclock  along with another reason for new alliances to try and attack sov if only to disrupt the level that a particular alliance has claimedthis isnt to install an i win button for the carebears of 00 that dont like the cloaky afkers but to give that level of safety they require after acheiving a certain level of system level ccp has made enough point in the game design that they love the destruction and harrassment of players in all areas of space this is more of a pacifier for the ones that cant hack it in 00 and continue to whine on the forums with the benefit of an isk sink
wth are you going on aboutthis post doenst even make senseother than stating the obvious solutionplease dont drunk post stop the evemail spam

subject pretty much sums it up for methe sticky above seems pretty out of date and i would like to know what my csm is planning to addressi realize their priorities may be evolving and changing but any info will be appreciated
we are preparing a report on our evil plans and it will be out shortlythe hard part of course is coming up with something that annoys everyone in equal measure
no need to reinvent the wheelyour eve mail spam for votes campaign accomplished that far beyond your unwritten expectations
this is their plan
the malediction is a tackle interceptor with a rocket bonus how often are tackle interceptors actually in rocket range pretty much never except for killing drones can we please get the rocket bonus swapped for light missiles a better targeting range wouldnt hurt either it cant actually target at its maximum tackle range which is ridiculous i know the devs wanted to look at frigate and destroyer balance soon so i figured this is probably a good time to bring it up
i agree with some more locking range for it but kahnid ships are all shortrange missile based so light missiles wouldnt really fit so well maybe a range bonus instead or somethingso 05
interceptors arent really made to dps if youre tackling anything dangerous you probably need to rely on your buddies to kill it anyway perhaps the rockets are really just for killing dronesbut id definitely support more locking range i understand frigates having a short locking range but they need to at least be able to do their job thats why the griffin has a lock range of 60km after all
targeting range is 2250km disruptor range with ship bonus is 30km wtf even with a maxed long range targeting skill you still only get 28km at the absolute minimum it needs another 2km of targeting range but preferably more so it can be locked by the time it enters disruptor range
weve already agreed with you that the locking range should probably be buffed no need to get worked up about it patience and rationality are your best bet for achieving a change not getting worked up and insisting on things that must happen
i can read i know you were agreeing im not worked up either i was just providing numbers to go with what i was saying i cant even fly a malediction
agreed this ship is the most of ccp unlogic thing in the gamelong range tackler with with 9km rocket range lol or using javelin to 15km lol range with horrible speed penalty this is a horrible unuseable designccp dev drunk so much when he created this ship bonusmalediction yell for laser turrets and optimal range bonuses forget ridiculous khanid design or swap long range tackler bonuses between the two amarrian inty without overheat this ship has 30km disruptor range but has 9km rocket range and 225km targeting range  lolwho wanna flight with this idiotic design when a navy slicer better than and cheaper and not need inty  traning days 
the bomb has a 15km explosion radius and it looks like a drone exploding please make bombs look like bombs when they explode
 1 from me that would save anyone that has to deal with the poorly designed lp stores heaps of time also they need to do something about the tags as some things cost more to make than there worth on the marketas for millions of lp a weekthere are s

ccp please fit is so all 4 hybrids are placed on the side rails of the kronos ship the 8th hi slot is needed to make all 4 guns group on the ship and would make it look so much better thanks
or move the turrets around between different high slots til you get the desired look also this is hardly assembly hall material this section is for more serious game changing ideas ships and modules would be more appropriate for your ummm complaint
yes i thought this was in the features and ideas section its not about changing the high slots till you get the look you want its how the hard points link with the high slots you need the 8th hi slot activated so you can have all 4 guns on the side railscan a moderator please more this to the features and ideas section also

something i saw today has compelled me to posti was in dodixie and saw some chap advertising a salvaging service in local for level 4 mission runners after watching him futily talking in local for a little while i was leaving the system and noticed he had cans up on the gates advertising aswell he was offering a very competative rate a 6040 split in loot and salvage isk in the mission runners favour everything about the idea was pretty good except the fact he was advertising in a trade hub not a mission hub except i couldnt help but feel like it was futile and slightly patheticnow imagine this same chap had a billboard which he could somehow link to a webpage advertising it plus an add on the cq screen in a major mission running hub he would be rolling in it i hear people advertising salvaging services all the time but ive never heard of anyone earning good isk out of it it seems a shame that such a basic and potentially profitable service is limited as a business because there is no way to get people to want to use it ccp says that salvaging is a career path but it isnt not on its own but it would be if you could advertise yourselfrant over also thanks everyone for the support criticism is welcome
agreed if you allow us to advertise on billboards on the big screen in the station environment it would cut down on the number of cans floating in space oo plus it would give these fine corporationsalliances out there to get their name spread around and increase business
possible source for an isk sink based on traffic through the system much like the cost of offices in a station10 billboard max and it costs more the longer its occupiedanything is better than those cans

looks are of no real importance effectiveness is the only real measure of a ships worth that said i cant say ive come across a ship in eve that i dislike the look of

this is really overdueregarding the tags the current system allows a smart player to work out the good conversions and the bad and buy the appropriate tags market forces take care of the rest
the future of actual logistics as opposed to logistics ships is just in need of getting in the hands of the developers were not just talking nullsec either were talking this could be easily used all through new eden especially if an eventual t2 jump capable version were to come outif i feel like it tomorrow i may actually break out the pencil and paper and sketch up some ideas for the model for at least one of the racesi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
okay so im going to be cleaning my garage instead as i just moved in an attempt to turn it into personal space so i have a nice place to game so the sketches will be waiting a few days but keep the suggestions rolling and try to get this idea to csm or dev attentioni am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
what about nonfw mission runners then
perhaps people should scoop more tags in missions now that they are so expensive shouldnt players be rewarded with expensive tags in return for losing access to certain high sec regionsthe only problem i have with the lp store is that the tag requirements are enormous for some items  which i guess means ccp wants those items to be for vanity items than for utility but i would love to regularly fit up fed navy mods on my fed navy comet
i do feel the tag requirements are too high as everything in eve is based around riskreward and timereward lp store tag requirements are too highthe lp stores purpose imo is to provide mission incentive by rewarding shiny objects to those choosing to devote time to missions over anomolies by providing faction gear every so oftenthe trend that nobody uses lp or tags for acquiring faction items but rather purely as an income generator based on how much isklp ratio you can make on contracting your lp items or selling tags on the market at inflated prices for those who want to avoid the lowsecfwstanding hitits less hassle to just buy a navy invul off of contracts than from the lp store at 300 million for tags plus 72 million for the lp store price its only 100 million more to buy one thats like 4 missions in isk bounty salvage vs 30 ish missions in lpi dont think it will change as too many people use lp as a supplemental mission income and a key component of how much iskhour they make grinding missions i just wish it wasnt about churning them out like a bot and more about enjoying a pve experience in acheiving a goal of being entrusted with soem shiny faction kit in reward for your serviceif some of the ideas presetned here were adopted ie tags were much more easy to come by then i think the lp store would operate much more as a nice bonus than an isk stream
remove learning implants i do support this
good argument plus implant also serve a an isk drain on the game economy being only produced and offered by npc get rid of them and ccp will take away your money in just another way or limit you income by botteling up one or two isk faucets
you dont know what an isk sink is do you
learning implants sourced from the lp store are a considerable isk sink 12m isk for a 4 i believe
was gonna saysomeone forgot to get their cup of quafe stop the evemail spam
your argument here is a bit hamfisted your logic is that anything that involves risk in pvp can prevent pvp and therefore should be removed that sort of ruins the entire point of the game if implants are a particular problem for null sec due to bubbles then make it so null sec bubbles dont hold pods thats easy but dont ruin the game for everyone due to one particular isolated problem make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
wow its like you totally missed the last 23 pages of this discussionlets get something out of the way here this isnt about risks in pvp this is about being rewarded for not taking risks
that highlights a problem with industrial platform survivability not with the idea of reduced security in empire ccp seem to want more people in null but they make zero effort to make sure that all playstyles are possible in null hence the epic merigoround of  nerf highsec  help my mining barge is made of paper  bubbles are unfair etc etcimo the first thing ccp should be doing balance wise is to look at every profession and ask is this actually possible for a casual new player to do in 00 with a t1 ship and where the answer is no buff the platforms
whats empire p jkwith suicide ganks and war decs i think low nul and wh space is safer than hs tbh
many ships are uglmany ships are uselesmany ships fit into both those classemy list is different then your list which is different then his listi have never really liked any of the caldari designs some of the minmatar ships are likeable the more i fly them and gallente have their own issues amarr tend to look the most polished and built ships its jsut unfortunate that they are all penis shaped
they would make better collectors items if they actually costed a little bit so it would actually be enjoyable to collect them as it would give one a sense of accomplishment plus the zephyr and echelon actually can do something that other ships cant do the apotheosis doesnt have much over a shuttle but theres not much to the different kinds other than looks anyway the primae has nothing to its name though it cant do anything better than tutorial reward shipsi necroed this thread because i wanted to discuss this and so i did a search to see what other people had said about it rather than carry on a tirade about something that had probably already been discussed before

i like the fuel needed for cloaking idea especially the use up something from pi part
i find this funny coming from nul sec alliancewhats wrong too many cloaked ships preventing your ratting bot from performing its tasks how would this work for wormhole people i can see the crying threads now as a covert ops pilot who sits in wormholes i too actually like this idea as long as we either get larger cargo bay or a cloak fuel bay the problem with this idea is the fact any ship in the game can fit a cloak with every ship being able to fit a cloak a fuel bay for cloaking cant be put in unless they do like they do with t3s and add a cloak fuel bay when the cloak is added

because it would be a terrible idea that would further stagnate nullsec sov instead of encouraging the conflict that ccp wants and that the game needs to thrive because it would have farreaching effects allowing a sov holder to turn a gatecamp system into a cloakfree system almost completely shutting down the ability to travel through that space because cloaks are used for a lot of things not just sitting afk in a system intimidating nullbears
i hope there is a mention of the imac issues on the agenda somewherehow hard can it be for a csm person to ask what ccp plan on doing to try and fix the multitude of mac issues then provide feedback to the community
i feel the main problem with the lost feeling is much simpler  the game simply doesnt tell you anything about itself sure theres tutorials on very basic level but thats about it let me give you some examplesyou got your first ship you are ratting things are going well eventually you get a cruiser or scrape together every penny and buy a battlecruiser which you almost immediately lose because your guns cant hit frigates any more and nothing in the game explains why that is you have to go into the module info and figure out what tracking stat is and what it means and search for an explanation the game itself will do nothing to help all i learned was through search engine outside of eve itselfin the same vein theres things that are not explained at all but which are vital to your survival as a new player case in point  missions without knowing about a site like eve survival where you can read about the mission make sure you have the right tank and ammo figure out what the triggers are and what your kill order should be you will die a horrible fiery death i still vividly remember having to warp out over and over because i didnt know this and shot two triggers in a row just totally by accident targeting random ships now sure now i know now i also fly a ship that can easily tank most of the pocket aggro anyway but for a newb one or two deaths and they will say f it and move to a better game note not easier  better just because it will tell you what you need to know without requiring a third party websitesure some might say its culling the weak and so on but it really isnt its just poor game design either the info on missiontriggers should be in the mission briefing or triggers should be removed altogether in at least l1l2 missions nobody but newbies does them anyway and the pay is so abysmal that it really wouldnt harm anyone or anything and by l3 and up the new players can start figuring things out on their owni could give you many more examples of things that older players take for granted and see as normal like forgetting to scoop up drones before warping its just an annoyance but for a new player for whom a flight of t2 mediums is still a sizable isk investment one little mistake like that can be crippling and the probability of an immediate ragequit very high if this happens before the player gets sucked into the game  congrats you just lost a subscriber and a few months down the line a possible juicy pvp targetin other words eve really makes no attempt to try and keep the new player which is fine i guess if you want the game to remain relatively obscure with a comparatively tiny population if however you want more players a smarter and more structured and most importantly better explained beginner experience would go a long way tutorials were a step in the right direction but they still fell woefully short for what is needed in a game of eves depth tutorials themselves are rather outdated as well with some serious misinformation gallente tutorial calls drones a gallente racial weapon right now its a support weapon system at best by itself it is nowhere near comparable to turrets or missiles but a new player believing the tutorial to be accurate might focus solely on drones ignore turrets and missiles and gimp their progress rather severely like i did i bought that line hook line and sinker until i realized that without turret skills trying to do a mission was slower than a snail and that theres no such thing as a pure drone boat  drones always function in auxiliary role along with 46 turretslaunchers and without said turretslaunchers your damage is simply pathetic but the game doesnt bother to tell you that if you start as gallentealso the drudgery on waiting for skills before you can advance is rather heavy what i mean is standingswise i was able to run next tier missions long before i had the sp to even poorly operate the ship required for themjust my 2 cents on the topic of newbies quitting
mentor insigniai sit on enough channels that i dont really have time to pay attention to noob help its pretty chaotic in there but i dont mind people convoing me as i fly around however i dont take time to go find noobs in need of help because there are so many of them and they dont ever know who to ask isd have their own requirements taht im really not intrested in  but id still like to help noobs possibly a tag free for anyone who wants one but then with a rating system available to characters under 30 days old thats a jacket id wear
currently concord works to keep the empire regions safe by dealing with aggressive acts done by anyone in their controlled space i have a proposal that with not change the way concord security status or suicide ganking mechanics work just alter the thresholdproposallet players with sufficiently high security status be deputized by concord to remove players with low security status as they are known criminals  in concords eyes and are not welcomeif your secstat is 30 or more you can legally destroy any ship if the pilot has a secstat of 50 or less with no concord intervention if you fire on their pod concord will react as normal caution is needed as once you open fire the target is by concord sanction allowed to return fire and destroy your ship in battle so be careful who you shoot atthis will allow willing empire based players to proactively protect their space from the known criminals that are passing through or causing headaches the criminals will have to consider a better ship to journey to empire with or take a pod also empire side gate camps are not out of the question empire point of view we do not want known criminals in our space we can now attack and destroy criminals on site before they cause a problem for our corp mates lowsec point of view now when i go into empire space theres even more people willing to pvp and fight me if they all run away i can still go gank miners also if i bring a fleet we can let them die without concord cleaning us outoptionsa all numbers are variable and are open to modificationb make system status vs security status change the limits on killingc deputy duty costs the player isk  per month  d add an icon to the overview for identificationplease comment and constructively build on this i have nothing against negative posts but  youre a moron go play more or you dont understand this game at all is not helpful in any manner if you want to call me a moron either back it up or help me be more educated
you obviously have no sense of what security rating does right now
thanks for the input from reading online the impression i got was secstat didnt matter for concord if you shoot first your diei will be reading into this more deeply
sorry for the tersenesslately these days we get alot of yahoos proposing really off the wall ideasso to be polite and sincere the problem wiht security ratings is not the criminality aspectits that being a postiive sec rating is a waste of time short of delivering a harasher penality for invoking concord on an 5 sec rated pilot being a targetaside from thatworks as intendedyou cant shoot anyone in high sec unless they are flagged to youyour corp as an agressoror war decor 50 sec ratingpeople are good at hiding when in those conditionsand choose when or when not to engagethere are waysbut people are searching for ways to make being a 5 there abouts worth something i suggest you work on that aspect and not worry about the ones who can be shot at with 5also bear in mind suicide gankers are ususally 00 toons or people who dont care and they are not the kind youll be able to hunt down in high seceven if you do kill onethey wont care hardly at all to be honest stop the evemailUFFFDspam
my last bump to this thread before i leave it be
operation write down all things is taking over where the thousand papercuts project left offplease check this thread
thank you tobiaz
the missile revamp also includes changing the explosions  at least as far as i know and the longterm dx11 projects change damage graphics altogether and look epic btw and with bombs being a kind of missile in eve i think that ccp is already working on something
explosions are basically fire as far as i know there is not enough oxygen in space to have a fire unless it is fed oxygen i doubt there would be an explosion hehe i wonder how many people will get blown up by their own bombs watching the animation lol
with inferno ccp is talking about  i like this idea it is well overdue i would like to see a few things to come in behind this1 if you are not the final blow but you help pointkill the ship or pod you should also get it added in your kill mails to count as a personal kill2 kills and deaths in pilot info all though i would not like this in some ways because people dont have to know about kbs to see if you are hostile or not but i think it would help new players see who is hostile and who may not be a threat3 corpalliance kills and deaths in corp and alliance infoi think it would be great if we could get rid of outside of game kbs all together it would be nice to have ccp track this stuff so we dont have to worry about posting our kills to several kbs because everyone has their favorite not to mention having issues posting kills on those kbs because their api pulling system is broken
so yeah my sketching of the proposed vessel hulls didnt exactly come along but i will get to it until then please keep the ideas and suggestions rolling in i will also be cleaning up the original post with some of the detailed ideas that have been given thank you all for your support and inputi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
help wanted please help identify the rough edges  holes  balance problems with this idea if you cant find any then please support
there are a lot of other threads about this though the last time i saw a thread on this it was a few months agoanchorable hacking modules is a nice idea i like the idea that it has to be manufactured by players and used as any other pos module as to the time line why should it be easy why should it take less then a week the potential profit off the pos is much greater then the effort with an anchored hacking module at the same time there are reasons why people are offline for long periods of time even small corps 115 or medium 1550 corps may not always have people around to fuel to pos either through lack of roles or simply because of rl issues devastating their play timewhen i started with my corp it had 15 active members right now there is only one other still active true its been 3 years but due to rl circumstances that i couldnt control they have all had to bow out also due to relationships with nullsec alliances ive lost newer members to those groups its hard when you spend a long time to train people in eve only to get them nice spots in nullsec alliances away from your aothere have been a few times that ive let the towers go offline once when i took a vacation once when i had to travel for business and occasionally but not often when i simply forgot to fuel them on time i get them back online within a few days but that was still an opportunity for someone without any effort to take my stuff if your 24 hour hacking module is put into playwith truely deadabandoned towers it shouldnt matter what your timeline is but to protect people that have occasional lapses or are unable to get online every day it should be longer then 24 hours like mxzf said not everyone plays every day this does not mean that their opinion or addition to the game and their ownership of pos towers should be more at risk then it already ismake the time it takes to hack dependent on how long the tower has been offlined longer the time offlined the shorter a time it takes to hack id say that a day is the shortest time it should take
i see a vanity isk sink for highsec space which is of course where the majority of players live and recruitment happens
it could turn into vanity isk sinks but when over 70 of the eve population lives in highsec your ad will be seen by most
well  i think i do basically it comes down to interaction with npcs if you get money from them bounties mission rewards insurance payouts etc then its an isk faucet if you give money to them lp stores npc taxes fees etc then it is an isk sindpayments between players dont change the amount of isk in game if your ship gets shot down then you have lost an investment and assets worth a certain amount of isk but another player who manufactured all that stuff got paid for those assets and still has the money so no change to the overall ingame isk amount
i am a major supplier of a alliance of warships and i have plenty experience with fitting on mass scale that could be improved with current glitches and short comingsthis particularly came up to me when i was fitting 200 thrashers for the upcoming burn jita to free the mittani world event organized by ccp and the mittani fitting each ship involved multiple steps1 unpackaging2 making active ship3 hitting the fit ship buttonnot so much of a problem if you are making one a day for yourself but doing it on a large scale is murder 200 times 3  600 clicks yea i might need a new mouse of course that is optimal and i would estimate it was even morebecause every 10 or so ships more or less a module glitched and broke off from the stack and formed its own stack for special snowflake tard olympics mods that take up space but cannot be fitted the glitch prevents me from fitting one of that module to the current ships and all future ones requiring me to undock or add two or more clicks because the glitch also gives a warning message of warning me about it not being fitted that needs to be clicked to go away of course if you undock you have to check where on the massive stack of items your place is another glitch or nuisance message i make contracts of 10 ships in each one for each ship in the contract it warns me that the ship contains stuff which of course i know because i just fit this message should be easier to remove hell remove all dumb warnings options for pros and certainly not do it for every single ship contracted i was thinking of contracting the fitted ships to another char but lol i would get 200 messages of this warningit would be great if i could have a stack of one hundred ships packaged click on the stack and select a fitting for all of themother fixes to save fittings which others brought up1 allow ammo on gun or script on mod to be equipped and saved in ship fitting2 allow stuff in cargo hold to be part of the fitting3 allow chars to fit modules that they cannot use why not just have it red if it they cannot use it by doing this and other fixes to make it easier to fit ships people could spend more time playing the game part of the game and not the hundreds of clicks in a hour meta game in addition to helping the vets and super organized alliances this helps casual players who want to spend more time on fun stuffyea i know this has been brought up likely before i am doing it again ccp and csm have been a bit more bold in recent months to improving game so no time better then the present
this thread gave me this idea add saved fittings to the context menu right click ship  choose fittingalso a yesno prompt on fitting rigs instead of telling me that it just refuses to put rigs oni dont deal with fitting out more than 510 ships at a time so i cant really comment on the ops request for bulk fitting support
i concurfurthermoreobligatory show me on the doll where the mean cloaky touched youand on top of that i have to make the following pointsif a ship is cloaked it cant target engage hurt youif you cant deal with this give me your stuff insert character into biomass queue over  move out of your mothers basement take a showeri am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
thistotally agreed stop the evemail spam
nice to read all the great stuff from the much greater persons here dont waste your time here the are all stupid u have to know no u know allready that u are the greates that can deal with everything and when not your friend will do for u the fuelidea is a really nice onethe fuelbay idea too with this option u can give different ships different cloaking times a normal bs maybe can cloak just for 6 hours but a force recon for 24h and a covert ops for about 48h or something like thati think this idea has a great potential
today is the second day i have absolutely no access to play on my paid eve subscription due to the corrupted patch ccp distributed on day 2 of the inferno escalation the installer will not initiate the game so i and many other mac users are dead in the waterccp is of course quietly ignoring the fact that once again they have screwed up implementing a patch and are silent as to when theyll fix this problemi totally reinstalled the client from the ccp site as many other mac users did and still get an error message the same that other mac users have posted in the dev blogs and mac users forum postscan the csm at least get a response from ccp asking players to troublshoot the problem and post their computer fits is not the same as ccp responding to the problem and devoting manpower to fix iti can not play at all and can only access you thru eve gate i am losing paid time on my accounts while ccp doesnt even respond it takes quite a while to reload the entire eve client from the ccp website so it would be nice to know they have fixed the problems before i attempt that againmac players really need the csm to stand up for us on this one
if there is a problem with the mac client i am sure ccp is working on correcting the issue quit blowing it up to being more than what it is  happens mistakes are made ccp isnt the only developer that has ever screwed up a patchyou know what the whole post comes accross as a whine i am sure i would have responded differently if you werent whining about it in every sentence like you are bieng singled out and treated unfairly

thank you for your thoughtful response i have read some of your other posts in the forums  apparently ccp can do no wrong from your pov  highly suspect if you are actually a mac user at all tbh  nonetheless i respect your apologist opinions  at least you are consistent you attack anyone who has a complaint against ccp besides its just my money going to waste right why should i trouble your day talking about it
my pov on ccp is they are in controlthey own this productthey choose what to do and where to gowe can either work with themor quitbitching at them and telling them off accomplishes nothingi may not agree compltely on how they handle itbut ive learned a little to late that making demands of any kind or sort is nothing but a total waste of timeas to my backgroundim a fully crednetianedl apple technicianalso apple care qualified im very familar with the hardwareand have a great deal of insight on the archetchure that is osxwith a good chunk of unixlinux knowledgeim not an expertbut i know a little too much to allow people to just bs their tongues out and make claims that are obviously quite falseas ive repatedly tried to tell peoplestop treating eve online for mac as an mac app and treat it as a windows applicationthings start to make sense at that pointyou start to understand that ccp is not intentionally breaking itthey are fighting an environment that is inheritly screwed overthat lives an environment that is orederly and standardized 2 countries2 languagesmassive communications barrierwith a translatoreve online for mac is actually windows version wrapped up in a winetranslatoremulation package that tends to do poorly in many areasdo a little probing and youll find a windows file structure hiding in plain sitewith its own little c and suchlittle details like that make life difficult to live an unix file system with very specific rules often ignored in windows that is the tip of hte ice berg at that pointadmitedly apple is not helping either with the latest version of their osbut it is what we have to work with for the time beingif you have been reading my posti droped a very subtle hintdont patch immedatelywaithold off for a week or twoand things start to work againsome people cant do thatand they do itand it breaksthey yellscreamflameand what does it get you in the endnothingccp may not be doing their aboslute best for mac usersbut screaming wont get them to do it either but they are working on itand its evidenced they arebut dont expect them to drop everything just for you eitherif you dont like itno one said you had to keep paying for itbut dont come here like some crazed nooblet yelling for something you wont getthe csm wontwell notcannot help you herethey are not going to push for a platform that is still a minoritydo i worship ccp nobut im not stupid eitherps im not telling you offim telling youcalm the  down and be paitentthey will get it fixed upif you have toodust off your windows tower and sit tight oh and no ive not patchedand i wont until its been more than a weekfor obvious reasonsill be using my windows tower for the time being this isnt an hate mac or hate windowsits calledim adapting and playing eve when i canprue and simple stop the evemail spam
impressive credentials sir  but in case i missed it you never claimed to play eve on a mac did you the new installer did not give the opportunity to wait a week or two  the patch on day 2 was preceded by notice of incompatibility that did not allow you to log in without the patch the patch then loaded corrupted files
i think the lesson that should be learned here isbuy a pcif ccp is really having this much trouble with the mac client then perhaps they do need to work on it a bit more or drop it either way i am sure they are aware of it and are working on correcting it they wouldnt just ignore a problem with the client that prevents players from playing the game either they have a fix for it or they are working on it
i understand that it works better to install wine for mac and use the windows version of the game than to use the mac client since the mac client is just the windows version with an outdated wine wrapperqa would never allow them to release current wine version by the time its tested its outdated anywayalso mean that you will only have the issues that linux users have which are mostly to do with the launcher and directxfun fun having to emulate one version of directx to install then a different one to play it but it plays
ok smart assignore my post and not read itill spell it out for you yes i play eve online on both mac and pc have been for 2 years plusi have made it clear on the mac forums if you can read that is that i will not patch for 2 weeks until they clean up the messbut since you refuse to engage brain and contiue to cry and scream for your emoragethen please continue until your vocal cords bleedhonestly its a wonder mac users survive anymore stop the evemail spam
agreedive got a mac pro from me dad being handed down to mesweet piece of equipment it isgot plans to try a few thingsmacbook pros are not exactly a great platform for messing with wine and suchbut then again my time these days is so limited directx is an utter pain in the ass to deal withtried at one pointkept running into massive headaches and i did actually get it to work at one pointbut the graphics where totally fail by the time i got therethat was before apocrapha sp releasedi miss thatwas the best mac release thenstrangely everyone else hated itfunny thatthese days i hesitate to launch eve on my mbp as the bloody core temps keep jumping upim worried ill come back to a melted pile of aluminium instead of a soso working eve client that would be apples fault btwfor stupid engineering on placement of cpugpus stop the evemail spam
so in all honesty you are not familiar with how the process has changed with the inferno patch because you are still in your 2 week period of playing on the pc and thus have no idea about the mechanics that led me into the corrupted files as dictated by the new installerperhaps you should have asked those questions before calling me a smartass implying that i an stupid while all the time you sit back and wait for ccp to fix the problems i have brought up so you can safely log on with your mac in a week or sothis situation is far worse then the past sir yet the only fault besides an alleged emo rage from me you can identify is a poor design by the apple engineers ccp is squeaky cleanyoure an apologist and that is certainly your right please have a good life sir i am done with you
that is what you have to say in the face of common sense telling you to calm the  downyour utterly pathetic and an embarassment to the mac communityall you are is a emoraging fool who has nothing better to do then to make demands because you dont like how things have ended upi watch and i study and i read the mac forums prior and after patch time to get of a sense of what to expect i do not blindly walk into a problem like everyone else who has a tendency to just blidnly click their little trackpad button or mouse this is excluding the brave mac warriors who patiently report bugs and attempt to help ccp troubleshoot howeversorry im not going to do thatnot for everyonethis is much like living in 00do you jump into a system without checking localnounless your an idiot and a foolyou can make all the conclusions you wantbut you obviously have no idea what your talking aboutno concept of how things workand too bitter to see straightas ive already saidyou can either readand learnor scream until your vocal cords burstfact of the matter remainsby the time i do patchccp will likely have resolved all known issues related to the patch nowand i will not have to worry about redownloading or reinstalling my clientjust like every other time ive done itits called experienceand knowing the experinces of living on a mac while playing attempting to an windows game forcibily engereed to live on that maci cant help the fact your ignorance reigns supremebut saddly it seems it is not a blissful one to be sureid say enjoy itbut that seems impossibleoh and one last thing since your likely going to rage quitcan i has your stuffwelcome to eve onlineget a pc insteadsince you cant handle itjust dont bring it up to your windows buddiesthey may take advantage of the victory your just an young welp of a pilot who thinks he knows betterwhen your journey in eve has only just beguni have played this game far longer than youyour just yet an another in a long line of whining noobs claiming i have the right to tell ccp to go  themsleves or else when you know aboslutely nothingyour a paying customerso stop payingquitand leave ccp will get to each and every issue in due time and processas they always have over the various patchesi have only had 1 major failure of a patch on the macand that was the last time i installed the patch on patch dayi always wait 1 to 2 weeks depending on what breaksa concept you refuse toand likely incapable of understanding stop the evemail spam
paintchkyou made my daykeep it awesomerofl
i couldnt agree more that some kind of change to the overly safe nature of null sec i can remember being a scout before anoms and if you were decent to good at scanning you could pinpoint a cluster of belts warp and in warp you could pin point your targetwith said mechanics we have now you have to jump in press scan and just hope you go to the right one with no ability to do a dscan and know if your in the right direction at the very least i would like to see more anom rats that tackled or some kind of fix that i can dscan my targets in the same time frame i could a belt
well if thats what it takes then sure delay your local pop in timespecific ideas aside its just too safe to rat in an anomaly granted people need a certain amount of safety otherwise its just not wroth doing thats why id be a little worried about removing local entirely without putting in another intel tool for people i honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
there are plenty of intel tools corp chat alliance chat shared intel chat constellation and region chats that could be used to report movements of known pirates in the area cloaky scouts dscan combat scanner probesjust how much do you need to be able to maintain security
if your worried about losing your intel abilities over localthen you have seriously very poor skills in intellgience to be sure stop the evemail spam
agreed local is your last line of defense you have seconds to react to potential threats in local combat scanner probes and dscan can provide the same amount of warning and a lot more information than people are here
yepfor someone who makes such a claim the guy who said hes worried about intellgienceobviously would be easy prey in wormhole space stop the evemail spam
a think a 510 second delay between people entering local and appearing in local would be moderately good for roaming gangswould more ratters die probably would significantly more ratters die probably not as any capable nullsec resident knows you can rat while aligned and easily warp away as soon as an enemy appears on grid this is also why the omg theres an afk cloaker in system that prevents me from ratting whines are so laughable heres a nullsec dilemma currently it is very hard to catch a ratter they essentially have to be the subject of bad timing ie a belt rat scrams them right as local goes up as long as its easy to avoid a roaming gang you gain nothing by forming up a response fleet and evicting the hostiles if its too easy to catch ratters ratters lose more than they gain by ratting essentially there needs to be a balance where people want form up when you appear in intel but you can still be mostly safe from marauders personally i think a 510 second delay will help with this balance
i dont get it whats the point of living in a nullsec system sov or not if you cant use its resources effectively any nerf to local or buff to roams means that mining out in null gets an even bigger nerf not only ratting carriersbeing unable to secure space to any real extent makes hisec activities that much more attractive to people why risk the carrier doing sanctums when i can be grinding l4 or incursions for more saftey and close to the same isk per hour infact with missions you can hire a noob and get a percentage of the loot drops and salvage thats not something that you see in nullsecbasically you are asking for zero ratting carrier kills increase the risk lower the numbers of people doing it as an alternative to hisec faucets the ones that stick it out in null are the ones that will adapt and be aware of your roams well before you get to their area
hey so i just had a great idea and i thought i would post itthe local chat window should be sortable by standingsyou might ask what purpose does that serve good sirwell i tell you it serves to make it harder for small high sec war dec corps to hide in high population systemsin my experience most exclusively high sec war griefer corps are a bunch of station camping carebears waiting for the lone indy pilot to run through in the event that they see an actual combat pilot enter grid they usually  their pants and dock upim tired of getting war decced and having it be just be too bothersome to hunt down the 5 bastards to kill them make the dam war targets blink and flash red at the top of the local chat window so that we can get the intel we need to hunt them down like we would in null seci want to make the high sec carebears feel the pain when they have the balls to war dec a much larger allianceanyways those are my 2 centstear it apart or love it as you will
i would like there to be an option to spend your to improve your ratial standingsmuch like in real life where corporations and people invest money to get a more favourable relationship with governments so why in eve cant a player go to for example an amarrian corporation and spend some lps to get an increase to thier amarr standings currently the only way to adjust ratial standings is to do missions to boost your status but that in turn negatively affects another race i would like to be able to bump my standings or that of my corp without upsetting the relationship with other races since the lp store is so limited
yeah sure why notalso it would cut out the boring slog to grind up standings to get to the missions you want to runi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
run a couple of incursions convert the lp and instant access to every l4 agent both mission and research of every factiondoes that really sound like a good idea
it would obviously be a sliding scale similar to how you earn standings more takes more and i dont think faction standings has any effect on individual corps anyway
cant support this lame excuse at an attempt for an easy button to tough to get standings youre in the wrong mmoi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
the only comment on this subject i could offer is that its not so dificult to get standings as per seit is however damn hard and stupid to recover standingsits almost like a 15 ratio when it comes to dealing with positive to negative standingsfor each increaseyou have to do 5 times the effort to get it backor something to that affectother than thatnot sure about this proposal to be honest stop the evemail spam
im not looking for an easy button more a way to use lp to repair your standings the problem is everytime you repair one races standings another races standings gets damaged
1 supportedthis is a great idea it should be 72hours imo if you are a dumass and forgot to put fuel into your tower and you only play 12 tough  log in check your pos hell use eve gate check to see is if its ran out of fuel it out generates an
this idea is so bad it almost hurts almost this idea does the followingreduce the incentive for people to try to have poss hisec or low because of single man corps consistently attacking research alt towers research alt towers are one of the reasons bpc are cheap enough for noob manufacturers to get into the game  nerfs the already nerfed dreadnought reinforces lowsec to be the nullsec alliance only playground it is fast becoming previously you needed dreads to take a moon from someone else or a lot of patience and battleships which required some active effort on the part of the attackers these new modules would take away that requirement and shift the balance much more to the defenders side you arent asking for more pvp youa re asking for more alliance blobs in lowsec  more expensive low end moon goo small independants are the ones that mine these at margin costs larger alliances can take and hold higher end goos but with it no longer being necessary for you as a goo miner to call out 1015 or so of your alliance members to take a low end tower of which im sure they all instantly volunteer for tower siege to round out your production chains of course if they do ring mining or some kind of goo mining in beltsanomsigs whatever instead of dependent on moons half of this will be moot no one will give a damn about dead towers on moons and its only in hisec that people will want to use these to avoid any actual work
a method to claim or timely remove an offline pos very much desireda method to claim an online pos  we already have the tools to do this its called form up a gang and shoot it
i like some parts of the idealet there be a mod you can anchor at any pos that will if no forcefield exist destroy the pos in 28 daysshould require a war dec to mount the module once mounted you can retract the wari want the towers dead not stolen deadwhy so industrialists have something new to build and sell
this i want a way to remove a dead corps pos without having to wardec and shoot it i dont want to destroy the pos i want to capture it otherwise its not worth the effort having a module that lets you steal poss and their equipment based on how long they have been offlined makes a lot of sense to me its a way to ensure that you arent unfairly penalizing active players that have put in the effort but slipped a time or two and still keep the tower removal to a sense able amount of time the current way to remove towers already requires a wardec several bs tier 3 bc can remove them already its slow and boring as hell with no real rewards hence no one does iti would say that 1 month offline is enough to consider it dead and a 48 hour unanchor time limit is good for that down to the other end of the scale 1 day off line should take 7 days unanchor time same as a wardec offline towers only1 year  12 hours6 months  1 year  24 hours1 month to 6 months  48 hours2 weeks  1 month  721 week  2 weeks  5 days1 week   7 days
personally i think attackinghacking a tower in highsec should require a wardec this provide a nice 24 hour warning to the corp that their highsec assets will be vulnerable to attack i dont know how usefulviable this will be with the upcoming wardec changes but it gives the defenders a fair window to protect their assets a hacking module that lets you capture a tower provides a nice incentive to engage the tower and so thats moderately reasonable leave it at a static 48 hour hack time if you leave your pos offline longer than that you deserve to lose it
i disagree that 48 hours base is long enough but i suppose thats not really that important if it takes a wardec
1would be nice to salvage this space junk rather then destroy it which takes ages i do agree with the week long timer and cost of the hacking structure should be reasonable nothing to small but still not much your not losing a fortune i like the 304
i could actually see some benefits to the eve community as a whole from this idea at the moment newer players who dont keep up with eve politics blogs external sites etc etc dont get much ingame exposure to the community side of eveif there were billboards about or adverts then all the new players would see ads for alliances etc some of the big alliances could even use the billboards for propaganda to talk about their recent wins or their enemies recent losses or to link blogs supporting or naysaying csm internet politicians the slightly less enthusiastic players who dont necessarily troll the forums like i do would actually be able to see the effects of eve politics in a real and meaningful way without leaving the game to me this is more exciting than the prospect of people advertising salvaging servicesi would also like to bring up a potential problem for ccp how would they regulate what ended up on these billboards if these ads could have links to external sites then links to lewd sites all over eve wouldnt do ccp any favors but i suppose the same can be said of local chat i guessin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
not exactly  the lp store is an isk sink the implants are just one of many elements of the store if you dont buy implants with the lp you will still use those points for other things and the sink will remainand no implants are a reward for not taking risk hence i support the thread from op
how do you figure havent been watching the killboards lately i take it stop the evemail spam
if your so stupid that you do not know how then please jump into a well and stay there and think about it
i agree on this onea seperate fuel bay for cloakers so it would be sufficient for them and would prevent afkcloaking for long preiods of timegame play would improve people would need to think new strategies and so onwhy is this a huge dealoh yeah sniff sniff i want to pewpew and nerfing my plans would mean i would need to think a new way how to grief players sniffsniff
my sincere thanks go out to the new csm7 chairman and the 2 other members of csm7 who took the time to respond to this thread and said they would inquire within ccp to find out the status of repairing the patch that has disabled game play for paying mac subscribers like myselfit is good to see people elected to leadership positions responding swiftly to the legitimate concerns of individual subscribers especially when the forums seem to be populated by far too many hostile self righteous bitter attack dogs
how fortiante for you i can tell you want the response is as wellwere working on it  know about the issueif youd actually pay attention and read whats available as far as resources and adviseyoud get somewherebut alascontinue beating your head on that brickwall alrightyou know where to find us stop the evemail spam
op your being trolled by a few knobs dont bite trebor is vice chair of the csm and he is also a mac guy im sure he will get the ball rolling on somethingin the mean time stay away from the orcs and bell ends that populate these forums
being trolled is one thingstating the facts is an entirely different thingstick to reality and dont make assumptions stop the evemail spam
1 this would be awesome it would get the player base more involved with the development of eve itself you guys go we are revamping xyz shipsmods or creating this shipmod what would you like to see it look like then all you have to do is select the
but you can use its resources effectively even with a 10 second delay 1 learn to not warp to a sanctums and belts at zero2 rat aligned3 bubble the ingates 4 use and pay attention to intel channels 5 operate in a group this isnt a huge nerf to nullsec living its an inconvenience to help boost nullsec roaming and hence small gang pvpthe real boost nullsec needs is more group activities if a solo ratter sees a small gang coming through their system they get safe and hide until the gang passes however when a group of ratters see a small gang coming through their system they can ship up and fight especially if you give the marauders a few tools to punish the locals for hiding rather than fighting think a player created incursionlike mod that takes 20 minutes to anchoronline and reduces bounties and ship ehp for several hours or a day or so
i dont understand what the 10 second local pause does for ratters reshipping nor does it make any material difference to intel channels as they can still see you from 10 jumps away your mod idea is stupid
it has nothing to do with ratters reshipping or intel chat channelswhen you enter a system there is a bit of time that it takes to scan for anomolies and warp into the site that amount of time is long enough that any noncomatose ratter can get safei honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
the 10 seconds is designed to make roaming feel less futile hence it will encourage more roaming its not an unbalanced amount as no ship in the game can enter system find a target and warp to said target before appearing in local even if they have the sanctum to warp to previously bookmarked currently local entirely favors the prey and this shifts the balance between hunter and prey a little to the favor of the hunter again this is a minor shift primarily aimed at boosting the moral of 5man cruiserfrigate roaming gangs as for my mod idea i realize it needs its own discussion on how to make it balanced but the idea is extremely sound the idea is that the locals have to defend their own space or they suffer some consequences currently if a roaming gang comes in the locals hide the roamers poke and prod waiting for them to come out and play but typically they just hide everyone loses as the roamers dont get a fight and the locals dont get to pve with a mod similar to this the roamers can at least punish the locals for a time period beyond the 1020 minutes they poked about system hitting nullbears in the pocketbook is just about the only way to get them to fight and this is exactly im suggesting really though nullsec needs more group activities ie sanctums havens and hubs should typically require 36 battleships to run effectively and the payouts increased accordingly this way the locals will already be ganged and grouped up when a small gang comes through and hence a little more willing to fight hopefully
you cant make people pvp when they dont want to and are already entrenched in their own systems a ten second delay wont do anything to change that nor would increasing the numbers of ships needed for sanctums i know people that already do sanctums in 23 tengus multiboxing because its easier are they going to engage a roam coming through nope ratting tengus and pvp tengus are set up differently 1020 minutes of reduced bounties or whatever is afk time cloak up call for hd fleet whatever if roams really wanted pvp theyd get somewhere and announce themselves to the locals but its not about fights its about ganking in null i know carebears or people that dont want to fight hitting nullsec carebears in the pocket tends to mean that their alts dont do as much fun pvp they cant afford the pvp ships or they dont want to risk the expensive ones since they cant replace them if anything more expensive t1 ships and all the miner ganking reduces the pvp potential because people arent as willing to do stupid things
1 you cant make people pvp nonconsentual pvp is very much a part of eve no matter where in eve you live i agree with you that blobs where there is littleno risk results in poor pvp experiences the 10s delay to local would result in more ratter ganks but not some omg nullbear armegeddon i rat in nullsec for income i have done so for a very long time and there are two reasons i lose ships a i dont pay attention becuase im pewpewing on my main or b i play bait and bite off more than i can chew i use smart ratting practices though and it makes me nigh impossilbe to catch do you know what a 10 second change in local means those that take the time to rat safely will still be very safe and those that dont take the time to rat safely have a 5 chance instead of a 1 chance of being caught 2 occassionally i multibox to solo plexes in null and occassioinally i multibox in pvp too however most of the time pvp leaves too little wiggle room for multiboxing unless your doing easy dps roles so your friend multiboxing tengus is really not relevant what is relevant is when i run the harder plexes with 34 corp mates or whs with 58 mates or nullsec incursions with 9 mates we often stick around and fight when someone tries to crash the party this is because we are already grouped up organized and ready to fight my point is a single person has little recourse against a small gang whereas a group of people even in mostly pve fit ships can put up a good fight against a small gang 3 the module idea the 1020 minutes is how long it takes to install the effect the reduced bounties effects would last for hours or more ie the locals take 1020 minutes to organize a response and stop the roamers from  up their system or they stay safe until the roamers leave and then are left with a less bountiful system its their home system they should be have to defend it beyond the 500 man cta blob bullshit that is sov warfare this thread player created incursions outlines the idea my corp mate had i personally disagree with some of the details but we both agree on the benefits something like this would add and its far from a stupid idea 4 ouch my pocket book yes when you have lots of income the consequences of pvp arent as meaningful and more income means you can fly more blingy ships or take more risks becuase replacing it means less this isnt an issue with catching ratters its an issue with the distribution of income sources within eve i pvp a lot and i prefer good fights where i dont know if im going to win or lose way more than ganking some random passerby getting those fights is not easy to get people to engage in pvp ive found you need several things a you have to be engageable i can fly any subcap in the game but typically roam in frigates because people are more likely to engage me i regularly take out roaming gangs and if i bring out bcs w logistics the only people that engage are bigger and meaner gangs but if i bring out t1 cruisers im much more likely to find some people to engage b there needs to be a reason to engage i can go through 30 systems with ratting drakesravenstengus while flying a solo rifter or taranis and nobody will engage to get a fight i literally have to hangout in a system to annoy the locals enough to ship up and chase me and then more often than not theyll try to chase my rifter away using bcs with falcon and logistic support the primary reason agonys lived in syndicate for so long is because there are many nearby groups willing to ship up and come out and play props to the syndicate residents that regularly show up to fight the rotten stinky truth is 90 of sov nullsec is full of carebears that just want to grind up assets the actual number of pvpers in this game is pretty low most people in this game are afraid to lose their ships and its really really pathetic in my mind nullsec resources should be plentiful that you can farm up a drake within 12 hours and losing that drake should be no big deal i know of certain nullbear alliances that forbid their players from willynilly engaging hostiles i know of several alliances that forbid flying in space when there is an afk cloaker in system etc etc etc thats  and any mechanic that makes silly corporation like this unable to operate in nullsec is a very good thing
making people deal with pvp when they dont want to is one of the things that makes eve greatotherwise wed be playing a game like wow or something where you have to flag yourself for pvp and cant fight in anything other than structured honor duelsi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
sorry i had to edit your post a bit to fit the character count i do not believe i have changed your message in any substantial way1you misunderstand me when i say that about pvp i dont mean that nullbear armageddon or anything i just mean that you wont get the people that are hiding to stop hidingadding a ten second delay will mean that they warp out even faster and the people that you do catch will be the ones that do the exact same things as they do now 2 my friend in his tengus is exactly the point make it so you need another ship and hes gonna get another account make it so you need ten ships and it will be run by 3 actual people make it need a fleet it may never get run or it will take five people in specialized ships running it none of them will engage a small roaming gang 3 make it a anchorable and destructible module sure but its a stupid idea if its not i wonder how long it will take for someone to figure out a way to make it a perminate addition to afk cloaky ships cause you cna be sure that this would be abused as all hell4 well sure dont imagine though that im saying that other things dont need to be nerfed but it seems that attempting to increase the amount of nullbear ships destroyed will just mean that fewer try it andor hide better a yes t1 cruisers will get engaged pretty often by t2 bc gangs more often then not thats not something thats easily fixed and not something that these changes would fixb hot drops and pve fitting i bring a drake you bring ten ships i bring ten ships you cry blob it never ends most of the time pve fits die horribly to pvp fittings why bother half the time people rat is to build up an armory for the next cta and the new ship requirements that the alliance has or to pay for that plexim going to have to respond to the ast bit on another post
everyone pvps consentual or not this is eve remember not the point though people are afraid to lose their ships and will continue to do so because they are expensive its embarrassing etc whatever people dont like losing tahts a fact of life not changeable by this sort of mechanic changein nullsec the resources are there but the security or ability to secure them are not bears will be bears anywhere they are and you cant force them to fight you attempting to is futile as they will move back to empire and null will be even more of the wasteland that it already is want to get targets make nullsec secureable add security measures to sov space so that traffic goes from sov space to hisec give an alliance a reason to court mining groups and a reason for mining groups to go out to null as it stands there isnt any saftey for a ship that warps slower then a bs except through a good intel network and a fast run to hide buttonyou can still roam through but it will be harder for you to stick around oh and the reasons that alliances tell people not to engage random roamers or be active in afk locations is to discourage roamers and afkers if they dont get kills or see activity then they will eventually go to somewhere that there is thats why they do it if they gave silly kills to every yahoo that came into your system with a cyno youd never have an empty system again
im ok with a sortable local chat but id go one step furtherturn local chat into an actual intel tool  ideally one that is not omniscient to all in local
as a pvppve player who often has to deal with clusters of wrecks to loot and salvage it would be great if we could have a key binding to open containers it becomes a real pain to open every single wreck and container on the field when there is a ton of them since it requires you clicking like a madman or moving your mouse back and forth until there is a streak on your mousepadadding a hotkey would save us time our hand and our mouse
i could see this as a viable option if the loyalty increase would only go towards a npc corperation secondly it would have to be scaled in such a away that you would still have to do some grinding example you run 5 level 4 missions turn in all the you made from those missions and get the standing increase as though you just completed one lvl 3 mission its not a whole lot but better then nothing google each mission before accepting it there are lot of missions that dont effect your standings with other factions its actually only like 1 out of every 45
no hes right gaining standing with any one faction hurts your standing with opposing factions if you have high minmatar standing you cannot have high or even decent amarr standing however the faction missions make it much worse because you lose a lot standing with one faction with a much smaller gain to your preferred factionit would be nice if it were possible to have good standings with all factions im not personally fond of the standings matrix
i was told that doing the pic arc missions gave some faction standing bost without the corresponding drop fromt he other factions these can be run every 3 months is this true and if so it is entirely possible to have good standings with all four factions it jsut requires you to not take those storyline missions of and of course a lot of grinding level 1 storylines give a 002 increase and a 001 or something like that to the opposing factions its been a while though so i dont rememberits possible though i believe
the minmatarr hate the amarr the amarr hate the minmatar if youre working for the guys they hate why should the other faction like you
i support that there should be an easier way to raise faction standings but not like this sorryin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
definitely agree that lock range needs a boost okay with the rockets thing though inties should never be getting into real combat except to defend themselves against other small ships or drones in which case the malediction excels due to the relatively high dps of rockets
changing the bonus to include light missiles would probably be alright in my experience rockets are signficantly more useful than light missiles on a tackle interceptor but i like creating options rather than limiting them
being able to put ads on the billboards would be cool it would also make a good isk sink
i was going to flame you until i saw your alliance well played sir almost got mei completely agree
so this is how the drones are controlled to manipulate things interestinganyway leave our attribute implants alone no real pilot ever stopped himself from having funn coz of impants only wimps like you if you havent noticed the best combat implants are the most expensive ones if anything theyv should change sets to give 5 to char attributes
drones lol its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
given the same amount of isk to spend on implants someone in a lowrisk environment will gain sp faster than someone in a highrisk environment because lowrisk guy can stock a small number of expensive implants expecting that he will not be podded often while highrisk guy has to stock a large number of cheaper implants expecting that he will be podded frequentlyso implants reward lowrisk activities by allowing you to amortize their cost over a much greater number of spits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
4 implants are really not that expensive if you use lp  you probably came upon this ideal after you fail suicide ganked a noob and lost your implantsif ccp did do away with implants i would want my isk value reimbursed to me i bought them so i could tra
010
still looking for good ideas
what i propose is an option to have an item purchased at one station to be delivered to wherever you would like to pick it up it would not be done for free of course a fee would have to be established depending on the distance that you would like to have that item delivered the weight of the object after all it would be cheaper for a turret than a whole ship you could also factor in whether that item is going to be delivered to highsec lowsec or nullsec  the more dangerous the delivery location the higher the fee more often than not i have found myself in need of something as simple as ammo only to have to make 8 jumps just to get it it would not be instaneous but it would have to be quicker than going to get it yourself this idea requires someone more suitable in the world of finances and logistics than i to refine but i feel like it would be a boon to all capsuleers out there no matter where they are or who they are
that requires you to have to wait on a player to pick up your item and deliver it for you plus the same amount of time is taken up as you going to get it yourself this cuts out the middle man
so cut out an entire profession because of your laziness and impatience nah logistics is supposed to be a painful yet critical ordeal
i did not say it would be cheaper so an entire profession would not be cut out those who would choose to use this service expedient service would have to pay a little extra for it it would make that person question whether or not it would be beneficial for them to use it or use it the old way laziness for some may be a factor in their decision but for others it would be a matter of saving time which time as we all know can be a very finicky thing to deal with
red frog freight  some foresight and planning ahead does wonders bro eve is driven by players not automated systems
eve isnt about cutting out the middle man the middle man is a real person and he needs to make a living too sandbox games are supposed to feature players as the main content players shoot each other with ships and modules built by players constructed in stations owned by players using minerals mined by players then shipped to jita by players i dont need or want magic wow style mailboxes that teleport stuff across the universe i think they would take away from the game
if eve was truly driven by players than the game would be controlled by the players we would be able to have control of the jump gates the players would be the law enforcement not the ai no unfortunately the players are just allowed to take residence in the world of eve nothing more
what would be the limit though if its too high no one will use the service except for the super wealthy which will put poor players at logistical disadvantage against wealthier players and if its too low then there will be a hard limit on how much a player can ask to move stuffwhich is exactly the point logistics is supposed to be a major factor in terms of where you live benefits of your location versus ease of getting supplies
the limit would be decided by our peers someone with the logistical background can formulate the plan and have the csm vote upon it numbers are not my strong suit formulating ideas are looking at pictures from different angles to see what other secrets it might hold
hahahahaha i like you you have a sense of humor mister first name stolen from mythology last name stolen from disney and a juvenile corp name coming to suggest npc shipping in a player driven game while claiming to be good at ideas i wasnt sure it was a troll until you posted this line good one man
what this guy said the feature you are looking for already exists
you have no business making ideas if you cant even understand the numbers behind those ideasi suggest you learn to play the game before you make suggestions to change that game stop the evemail spam
imnot going to flame you though i should im not going to tell you that you are wrong though i should and im not going to cry about game breaking ideas though i shouldi will say that this idea has been suggested before is already in game through courier contracts is done a lot by alts and is generally a pain in the ass to do by yourself in bulkthere is a logistical challenge implicit in making a game truly driven by players how far do you let players who by nature are complete assholes be complete assholes to each other it is well known and documented that normal people  internet anonymity  massive asshattery anal haberdashery letting people have completely free reign means that you have people like goons griefing people out of game encouraging suicide or shutting down market systems just to shut down market systems now imagine this happening all the time everywhereas to the gate control and other more realistic player driven controls for ingame mechanicsat what point does sovereignty control mean total immutable empires nullsec would never shift much like hisec never shifts because enemies wouldnt ever be allowed in to the systems allowances must be made for the game to actually functionas to npc cargo running id be for it as long as a few rules are set for it1 cargo must be below iteron 4 size or around 10k m32 minimum transit time is one week3 haulers are targetable explodeable and concord protected4 cargo is scannable5 haulers stop at every station along the path and operate like autopilot ships6 npc haulers have a base cost of 50k isk per jump establishing a baseline wage for other haulers you pay players for bulk and time7 and im not sure how collateral should be structuredbasically its a slower more annoying and much riskier way of moving assets while its npc cargo moving it doesnt cut any player professions but allows for the collection of small amounts of goods without all the annoying fetching it costs just enough that its cheaper and faster to do it yourself but not so expensive that it is completely pricing out using for small goodsoh i wanted to put somewhere that blowing them up works just like the current npc hauler blowing up other random consumer products things drop and you lose standings with the company that is shipping it i forget the shipping companies in eve
with the upcoming changes to battlecruisers skills ie making them racial it makes bc a de facto new class of ship rather than big bulky cruisers with more dps which is what i gather ccp was going for in the first place anyway since we all like new ships to play with and in most cases the models already exist i propose ccp intorduce navy and pirate issue battlecruisorsbrutix navy issueferox navy issueprophecy navy issuecyclone fleet issueas far as names for the pirate class and bonus for the ships i leave to brighter minds than i but i imagine a good amount of fun could be had with these ships and they could add some always useful variation to pvp and hell with any luck and reasonable lp costs the navy ships could actually be cheap enough to regularly pvp with
will mac users ever realize macs arent for gaming and start using the right tool for the right job
will trolls ever learn to think before they post stop the evemail spam
you can accuse me of not thinking all you want but im the one with a working eve client arent i
so am iand i was the one trying to be constructive while your being an assjust because macs are a minority doesnt mean we tell them off and to go get a pci was saying be patient and let ccp do their workyour just being an assthat is the difference stop the evemailUFFFDspam
hello alli just got caught up with the fanfest video about crimewatch and it set off a dominochain of ideas im going to start with the core concept and follow up with some auxiliary ideascore concept 1 making isk pvping in lowsecthere are essentially three groups here pirates victims and deputies well start with pirate mechanics any player with a 5 or worse sec status can affiliate himself with a npc pirate corp a player corp may also affiliate itself and all its members will be automatically affiliated in return for that affiliation the player gets a bounty for any ship excepting pods noob ships shuttles and the like of a player pirate deputy or otherwise the bounty is proportional to the hull destroyed and skill point level in that hull of the pilot flying it probably maxing out around 8090 of the price of platinum insurance to prevent farming for non combat hulls the skill points of the pilot is not a factorexample a player has command ships 3 and is flying a vulture platinum insurance costs 30 mil and pays out 100 mil the bounty on this player is 16 mil 30  90  35 the exact formula can change to be balanced this seems high to me so maybe 50 percent or somethingdeputy mechanics are similar deputies can affiliate themselves with a npc police corp if their sec status is 5 or greater in return he gets a bounty for destroying a ship whose pilot has a sec status of 5 or lower or any flagged pilot00 systems yield no bountiescore concept 2 luring in innocent victimsthis part is simple make lowsec more profitable more incursions better rats better ore etc or here is a radical idea stop seeding veldspar in highsec and load it up in lowsec the point here is to make lowsec a little bit more vibrant than cops versus robbers give robbers someone to robaux concept 1deputies with high sec status get special privileges for example a 8 sec status deputy may use light dictor bubbles in lowsec of course if this pilot ends up on the killmail for innocents or deputies he will receive a sec status hit clever pirates may get someone deputized to lay a trap but it will take some doing to get to that point and easily lostaux concept 2the higher the sec status of the system the larger the bounty the pirate receives accordingly gate guns and station guns deal much more damage in higher systemsaux concept 3players collect small amounts of lp for their kills also new faction pirate ships and police ships squad cars if you will will be seeded lp needs to be a low enough fraction to prevent farming
ok so as far as the lp for murdering people idea goes i remember during the questions section at the end they talked about rewarding people who have a sec status over 5 and sec status under 5 to kill one anotherit might be nice for people at the far ends of the sec status spectrum to get a little lp for fightingthe one thing id really worry about is people farming the system basically you get an over 5 alt and an under 5 alt and have them shoot each other all day you could make the lp gain based on the total value of the blown up ship minus insurance and all the destroyed modules as long as the lp gained gave less of a reward than the amount lost in the fight then it will always be profitable to blow up strangers but not profitable to blow up your alts or buddys shipoh yeah and lp awards should happen on an individual basis dont force an entire alliance to sign up faction warfare style with an npc pirate faction just so a handful of dudes can get lp thats just annoying i dont care if there is mercoxit out there nobody will mine in lowsec a hulk will last about 5 minutes until some random battlecruiser wanders into the belts and one shots themi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
this would need an isk sink to balance it out i think it would be better if the ship just dropped everything instead of half of it being destroyed that would double pirate income without adding any fancy new game systems or extra isk faucets an official ransom system would also be nice something like the new war dec mechanics you can offer money to surrender in a war dec and the winner of the war cant redec you for a while the same thing could be used on ransoms pirate pops up a ransom window and if the victim accepts the pirate cant lock them again for a period of time that would prevent the griefers who dont honor ransoms from ruining things for professional pirates who actually want to make money
your point is well taken i guess if you think about it this is how it should behigh sec low profit high safetylow sec mediocre profit medium safetynull sec high profit low safetyinstead this is what we havehigh sec medium profit high safetylow sec low profit low safetynull sec high profit low safetyin many ways null sec is safer than low seci think however if you made low sec profitable enough players would find a way to take advantage especially if you gave the deputies an edge with the bubbling for example or slightly higher bounties you could have a corp of deputies escorting hulks for example an enterprising pirate corp could grind to 49 roll into the fleet in thoraxs and the deputies would have to face the decision of preemptively ganking the thoraxs and reducing their own standing or watching a hulk get suicided first 
i bet it isnt evil enough vote corbin for csm 8 if elected i promise to convince ccp to remove high sec make use of the word pubbie in a single server game a bannable offense make insurance cover t2 remove jump drives and jump bridges make implants and skill books player craftable and then remove npcs from the game oh and ill get bounties fixed while im at it now that would annoy everyone
all i can say to this is amateur
hiderz are gonna hide but catching 120 ratters rather than 1100 ratters is a big improvement for the roamers i hope it improves enough to encourage more roaming gangs some people solo run incrusions multiboxing they are few and far between if you up the difficultyrewards of sanctums and havens to require 8 ships then most of the time people will run them in groups assuming they pay well if people are already organized into a group shooting npcs its a small step to start shooting other players especially when those npcs have whincursion level ais that switch targets many of the nuances were hashed out in the thread i linked this isnt the place to discuss it but it does need to be balanced between the attackers  defenders in a manner that encourages its use as a small gang item people are going to gank and blob its part of the nature of this game the only way you get people to be more reckless with their stuff is if they care more about the fight than they do about their ship the two ways this happens a they have more resources than they know what to do with or b they have goals they can accomplish while losing their ships the random nullbear has no reason to fight often grinding for capitals or plex rather than for a good fight this is what needs to change we need small gang oriented farms and fields to plunder andor defend people will defend their stuff when they have a reason to defend it but what can a small roaming gang do in the current state of eve they cant rf a tower they cant rf a station or its services they cant effect system upgrades nor pi nor  all the locals have to do is safe up and then laugh as the marauders have nothing to maraude we need livestock to steal crops to burn children to enslave and wives to    and they should require fast action to save 30 min the more time people have to respond the bigger the response and the more likely a blob thats like saying if you want new businesses to open you have to remove the risk in opening a business imo get that pansy iwantreallylowrisk carebear mindset out of nullsec take off the training wheels and experience the other side of the spectrum i know businesses will open when the rewards are greater than the risks people will partake in very risky activities whenever they see a decent reward for doing so look at whs people setup shop there all the time and they dont have local or some intel network to let them know when bad guys are coming for the majority of cases the isk they earn easily covers the losses they have if tomorrow they quintupled the npc bounties in nullsec but removed local altogether do you really think people would flee to empire hmm i could grind missions for a couple hours to pay for a drake or i could shoot 12 bs belt rats or run one sanctum note i wouldnt support this because the riches of nullsec should primarily be in resource collection not isk nullsec should be risky but with rewards that justify the risks
qfe disgusting behavior that needs to be ended i like your idea about the anchorable incursion thingy
local shouldnt be an intel tool in the first place  buffing it i want it removed entirely it should be like wormholes everywhere
reminds me when i was a wee caracal pilot learning the ropes in null sec what you can see everyone in the system by looking in this chat window ive had minimized since the first day i was playing thats just stupid
there should be a hotkey for everything imo especially repetitive stuff like looting
ughhhh there is double click now a hotkey for loot all wo opening containers would truly be hot
did it ever occur to you that maybe youre not supposed to have high standings with every race there are other trade hubs besides jita you know
yes it does if you have standings with a faction at 5 you have access to all the level 4 agents for that faction without needing the individual corp or agent standing
the sticky at the top says any person replying to the thread can check a box to show support for the issue which provides ataglance on the thread listing how supported an idea isfor the life of me i cant find a checkbox
doh thats a throwback from the old forums the new forums here have no such support box all we get is a like button sad face
1 i have been asking about civilian carriers for a long time now
thanks for the support matei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
well surprisingly enough you havent been paying attention to boobies as much if you did youd notice that they actually do move and the character breathes they rise and fall with breathing you can even see it on full body view
true but they dont bounce one bit when you walk or during idle animations when the characters looks over her shoulder were looking for that little bit of added realism
regarding server loadthis would be one of many potential things that would kill the idea of defense being positional i was hoping that the requirement of both a mutual target and mutual activation turret  defensive module would mitigate this somewhat it would not be as bad as line of sight requirements for examplehow bad would it be in a 1500 ship fleet fightif not positional play what a shame what other mechanic for mitigation would work im wondering if the positional mechanic im looking for could be simulated more simply with transversal velocity values those are stats the server already has to calculate for damagethoughts
while i think that this is genuinely a good idea there are a couple of problems one that you point out yourselffor an active individually targeted solution pretty useless youd have so many pilots throwing so much  at each other that the human mind would just not cope with the sheer amount of information that it would need to deal with to selectively counter each and every possible target for a passive similar to aoe weapons solution not difficult but then youve got the additional server load to counteract it as well as balancing out the module that would actually be used in a smaller fleet skirmish situation 2030 pilots for example your suggestion may hold water  but again your going to have issues in regards to whether the module in effect would be an active or a passive solution  and then the poor pilot controlling it would have to be extremely careful not to be primariedalso racially the amarr would be the strongest against most of the weapons used by the other races  lasers are being developed to shoot down missiles and in space would prove to be the most viable option  missiles are too slow to be completely effective and railguns are going to be near phalanxgoalkeeper levels of rof to have a chance of striking its target firing as they are dumb munitionsyoud also have to consider the extremely short range these weapons have especially in the real world  ciws generally only go around 24km  although some are as close as 350 metres  and the rate of fire as well would be immensehow would the modules act assuming a specific one is added in terms of  reduction of incoming rounds would it be skill dependant eg 5 per level or a flat unmodified value eg 35 destroyed
as it stands all an increased warp speed changes is the maximum aus you can achieve in the middle of the warp this is absolutely useless however for any warp shorter than about 20 au most of the time spent warping is in the acceleration and deceleration phases which are identical in length no matter how big your ship is what its warp speed is long warps shouldnt be the only time that higher warp speed actually helpsi did a highly scientific test with a stopwatch to get these numbers bear in mind this is only time in warp not align timedistance in au  time in secondsstiletto 135 aus warp speed05 au  261 au  275 au  3010 au  30515 au  3135 au  3270 au  35hurricane 3 aus warp speed05 au  271 au  285 au  31510 au  3215 au  3435 au  4070 au  52as you can see the only time there was a substantial difference in warp times was on the longer distances on any warp shorter than 15 au the difference in warp time was less than 10 better for the stiletto despite its warp speed being 45 times higherits a simple solution scale the acceleration and deceleration speeds with warp speed this actually makes interceptors and faster ships more viable tackleboats than recons in one area this would require some tweaking but its something that should be looked at

yes
1 im with you on the whole making faster warping ships useful thingnot sure about the actual implementation of changing current acceleration mechanic thoughmay be a bit much for current code i have no real idea thoughperhaps an across the board r
i like my idea and i dont see a how it would be too much for current code or b how a reduction in warp speed across the board would help anything
your throwing a fit over a 510 seconds acceldecel issuemaybe you should make sure your able to align fasterim sorry but i fail to see how this proposal is useful let alone constructiveperhaps you could give some exampls stop the evemail spam
you do understand what the phrase throwing a fit means right but ill answer your poorly spelled question anywayright now the time it takes to get to actual advertised warp speed is 10 seconds regardless of the ship youre in the deceleration time is 20 seconds that means with a warp speed of 3aus regardless of the size ship youre in a 20 au warp will take about 36 seconds 30 of which are eaten by accelerationdeceleration all im saying is that the acceldecel times which make up the largest majority of time spent warping scale with the warp speed of the ship this would make warp speed a viable factor in choosing a ship especially for tackling chasing down gangs so yeah i would call that useful and constructive
i like the idea but if it gets implemented the maximum speeds of all ships need to be brought closer to one another otherwise a freighter will take days to travel a big system
well since all im suggesting is to scale the acceldecel times it really wouldnt affect freighters because they warp so slowly to start with but i agree there would need to be tweaks to account for what the average warp speed is
1although the warp speeds acceldecel times and base align times for all vessels could use some tweaking 
what gives it has been years years and we still have to sell items one at a time giving us all rage attacks and carpel tunnel syndrome why do we not have a better interface for selling salvage and low end modules that build up after missions it takes me about 30 minutes to run through a mission and over an hour to clean out my station hold someone please explain why batch item selling still hasnt been implemented after 6 years 6 bleeping years of people asking for thisi know this is probably beating a dead horse but come on ccp what the hell
lp you mine are free amiriteas for getting the isk value reimbursed its like learning skills they promised that you would train faster full stop no reference to other players any scheme that replaced learning implants would need some way besides straight reimbursement to make sure nobody trains significantly slower than they do nowby the way 4 implants are cheap if you buy them in isk but a 30m isk skull still makes you think twice before jumping in a 5m isk frigate to go on a roam where you dont expect to be able to make it home if your ship asplodes thats the type of pvp implants end up discouragingthinking about it what about a hybrid system implants and boosters no stacking bonuses ofc its not great from a perspective of avoiding rewarding riskaverse behavior but it would stop punishing risk loving behavior so muchits easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths abrazzar the risk of having your day ruined by other people is the cornerstone with which eve was built ccp solomon
what you describe is worse than player hauling in every way and is a waste of time to implementwhy not just go ahead and do this stuff much more productive
actually it was part of the point to be worse then player hauling not everything you have is worth getting a player to pick up regional buy orders for something or simple hanger space clearing the cost is always optional i didnt want it to break the hauling profession but for low volume stuff it can be worth it to get npcs to collect it for you
never reduce player activity by having delivery doen by npcs you take that out and kill a career
no that is allin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf
or just a normal industrial ship the primae was just a gift they gave everyone in eve when pi came out to try to get them to try it its not meant to be a serious ship industrial ships and their t2 version are the main pi ships
that would be nice same for destroyers things shouldnt be implemented half way there needs to be a t1 t2 and faction version of everything imo

im trying to see how the idea i proposed would stagnate further 00 combat i feel that it would allow for more entertaining or even innovative fighting styles for the wh people if they are afk cloaking how do you know they are in the wh devhax
compared to many of the ideas posted in this forum this is well thought out and for that i am thankful im afraid though it still doesnt get my supporti agree with the notion that pvp should be more profitable and that lowsec should be more useful the reasons i dont support this particular idea is because we already have too much isk being generated from nothing i would prefer to have it transferred instead of created  i always prefer to keep npc mechanics out of the equation i dont like the idea of arbitrarily calling some people pirates and some people deputies i would much prefer something more organic and emergent simpler changes make a bigger difference especially with the freedom they afford i think a fixed bounty system would go a little way to helping lowsec in the ways you propose there has been a lot of discussion here about how to fix the bounty system  simpler and with fewer creases to iron out might be worth writing a proposal thread specifically for that idea with prices as high as they are at the moment the economy would benefit from there being higher numbers of mods in total and it would make pvp more profitable the only immediate problem i see with that is that suicide ganking in highsec would become ridiculously commonin the age of information ignorance is a choice wwwstateofwarconf

no it dont the only remotely jovian asset that is used by pod pilots is the pod its selfsleeper is not jove enemy sleeper is a drone
i think the issue most people have with this idea is the fact that jovian tech has come to mean gm modules and ships i see no reason why there cant be jovian technology available to players if it is balanced properly i dont think he means to give players access to gm ships i think he means to have technology reverse engineered from jovian drops like how the tengu came out of sleeper space if this is the case than i fully support it if you want everyone to get gm ships and death rays than no i dont support it
there is nothing forcing traders into jita except for profit and profit should never come without risks this is a game about shooting people and taking their belongings as much as it is a game about building trade empires commerce and larceny should go handinhand

generally speaking bad idea not just because it messes with the sandbox either it is also illogical doesnt make sense and would be a pain for anyone trying to do anything its bad enough jita is the only place one can fit almost any ship without having to buy from 412 different stations spread across 18 systemszubzubzubzubzubzubzubzub

i like the idea of group pve as a possible counter to getting jumpedthe one problem that would need to be addressed though is the fact that you need to fit your ships differently for pve and pvpa bunch of incursion fit machariels a webbing loki and some 50 basilisks are great for grinding isk but would make a poor home defense fleeti honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
though considering ccps general laziness instead of a whole new ship why not just give the existing orca subsystem modules similar to the tengu and allow it to be configured for cargo ship transport even salvaging and solo mining basically turn the ship into a fully customizable multipurpose capital industrial platform
no the incarna engine is already sluggish without overburdening it with realistic breast mechanics imagine a station full of bouncing boobs and now imagine the computers chipset screaming in agony at the additional physics load on top of the already inefficient station rendering engine
how is it sluggish works perfectly fine on my rig i even get 60 fps while in station you sure it isnt just your pc that is the problemalsoa couple of extra bones per character with physics would not cause the issues you are concerned with if it did then they wouldnt bother with making hair move at all
sincere questionisnt warp acceldecel somewhat balanced by align times and accel to warp timei know in my interceptor that align times are real fast as are the accel time to enter warp times get longer as ships get bigger if these factors do balance warp times how would you recommend changing them
ive updated the original post with numbers let me know if that answers your question
i was originally picturing an increase in warp acceleration for ships that currently have a high max warp speed and a reduction in warp acceleration for ships with low max warp speed which would have required the suggested tweaking to balance however if you arent reducing any of the warp accelerations then my point was moot i will add however that if you make the high max warp speed ships get to their max speed faster you will need to reduce that max speed some otherwise they will be way too fast at the longer warps
this could be easily adjusted imo id throw some adjustment numbers out myself but cant be bothered with the numerous other complicated things that need fixing this really shouldnt take long at all
these would all be moves in the right directionmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
sometimes it gets confusing what jump gate is next when you have a destnation and a few way points some of which dubble back on them selves for instance say i set a destnation to system a then system b and then c then i return to a at some point i will have 2 yellow jump gates on my overview what i propose is changing the color of each way point to say blue for waypoint 2 green to way point 3 ect  or add a number to the gate name like 2 jump gate name ps please forgive my gramer
i would like to bring up an issue that will most likely get flamed until the post is locked however i am certain that neither the gms or the players who support them have any idea what they are talking about when they refer to macros bots key binds and other such input manipulation as such the guidelines are vague to the point where based on how the eula is interpreted a player could theoretically get banned for using a mouse button to activate a module or perform a interface interaction the reason both macros and bots are on the eula is because the community wrongly refers to mining bots as macro miners while if you build a sufficiently advanced macro it may or may not be classified as a bot but generally a macro is as brief sequence of keystrokes bound to a programmable mouse or keyboard button the sad thing is we all use macros even if you dont want to admit it the very act of assigning programmable mouse buttons to a single key is technically a driver macro so lets face it if we continue to go by ccps idioticly worded elua all you players with gaming mice could theoretically be banned at the whim of a gm albeit most gms have these things called brains and will not bring down a ban hammer without good reason the biggest issue in eve is botting not macroing which is generally harmless and does not give players any sort of advantage aside from delaying the onset of carpel tunnel syndromea bot is a third party application which serves to automate some or all functions of the game for example analyzing market data for fast buy sell orders eg day trading basic npc like ai for roaming belts shooting pirates for bounties and the infamous macro miners who drive down the price of tritanium and make it difficult for players to actually make money this is the enemy ccp is trying to combat know it well a macro is one or more keystrokes bound to a key everyone uses these daily whether it be a programmable mouse button mapped to modules or a custom keybind to a unused media function however you look at it the definition of macro is too broad and wide reaching for a global ban policy especially since the game itsself has macros built by the wording of your elua using the skill que or delayed market orders could get you banned for those themselves are macros albeit programed and added by ccp but regardless of how you look at it a zero tolerance policy for macroing is too broad and wide reaching to serve its intended purpose to cut down on automated game play there is nothing automated about pressing a button on your mouse to engage your tank or fire a missile that is just a basic controller function additionally macros designed for moving items between a cargo hold and a station may be more advanced than a keybind but it is ccps fault that these exist if you troll the forums you will see hundreds of complaints about the ineficiant item interface considering the sheer volume of items that you acquire on a single mission there is no excuse for ccp to limit transactions to single items at a time basic keybinds and macros of this nature are not hacking they are not giving players unfair advantages they are fixing a fundamental interface design flaw that has been brought to ccps attention multiple times and through incompetance lazieness or downright petty spite the fixes and changes players want have yet to be implimentedccp says that their game is not to be automated in any way however as the game becomes increasingly complex ccp must add integrated automation features to compensate for this tasks which should take 5 minutes take hours we are gamers and this is a game not real life i am sure there are people who can sit around for hours on end playing a game but most of us have lives and we deserve to live the and still remain functional in the online world the client needs to be reworked from the ground up for more efficiency in performing common tasks as this is the only way to eliminate the need for macros completely u
i was going to try to reply to this but its really a whole new level of being intentionally dense so much so that i dont even know how to begin to respond to it
much of the eula and tos are vague giving ccp gms the broadest possible freedoms in choosing how they wish to define and judge ingame actions this leads to gms and devs often contradicting each other with judgements varying from gm to gm gameplay mechanics become exploits or working as intended depending on the time of day and whichever astrological sign is in powersorry scratch that astrology has nothing to do with it or else wed have some inkling as to how it will be decided i am pretty sure they meant to be vague what starts as a keybind  its a slippery slope the better defined it is in teh eulatos the harder it is for them to make bad decisionschange their minds about which isisnt against intended playi just had a very bad thought am i the nice version of mxzf quick someone  im not allowed to say what i want here because of eulatos  me
yupsometimes you cant spell it out for people who are just that literally densei guess at some point hell figure out the whole point of the clause in the first place is not so much the definition but the intent of use so to speakbut people are just that denseoh and not supporting yet an another nooblet proposal stop the evemailUFFFDspam
while i understand that ccp gms do not make a habit of tracking down and banning players for programmable mice it would still be nice if there was a little clarification additionally it is also known that gms usually convo a player suspected of being a bot to check whether or not there is anyone at the computer before issuing a banand while it may seem dense to some people i think the more clarification in a legal document the better

ccp please allow the rigs and cargo to be fit as wellas the loaded ammo charges and scripts make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
a few years ago there was no limit to the number of items you could have in a station ccp then limited it to 1000 fo help lowering the server load fair enoughtbut for some ppl and not only psychopath who love to accumulate stuff traders for example this 1000 item limit can be a problem as eve have more than 1000 different items and tenths minimum more are added each yearsthen why not making a skill like mess director or something which would allow you to have 100 more items by station by level
110
cant you just use station containers one would think that these would count as single items since the contents of containers are stored in separate databases from the main hangerthough 10 anyway there is really no need for this
yes i use many kind of container but as i sell in various stations spread out in various regions to sell stuff in a container from far away i have to repackage it then i get again more than 1000 items in that station and if later i go to that station i have to again put stuff in container to be able to drop news stuff in hangar its what i do for now but sorting stuff over and over and over in container is not fun and unless you use an external soft to manage your mess eveasset ftw ingame you dont have a clear view off what you have in stations  what i have in container t2 ammo and what in t1 module etc etc
well if this gets changed it shouldnt be skill based they should just change the upper limit that said im not completely sure if it should change or not the reason that its limited is to keep from killing all the hardware when you try to load the hanger if they can fix the hanger loading to be more efficient then it would be ok to increase the number of items in the hanger
moar ships
1 we need more shipsbtw you spelled battlecruiserss wrong on the title  
sureive seen this before however and theres the issue of finding a place for themthey would probably need different bonuses than the rest of their parent linewithout doing that it would muddle the border between them too much for example the sansha battlecruiser would put out nearly the dps of a nightmare with amazing tracking likely obsoleting both the phantasm and the nightmarethe issue is that the bonuses are intentionally overpowered and theres a trend of having the half the guns double the damage approachtake the cruor as another example adding a battlecruiser sized one would mean that it could have extra mids have extra highs more lowsi think if either would be done they would need a different set of bonuses from their parent line
i think the inability to deal with a cloaked ship in your system is indicative of your inability to hold said system not a failing of the cloak mechanicsif you dont have the skills or manpower to counter whatever might come from the cloaky chances are you will lose the system regardless of cloaky being involved or of more traditional ways
so then about 85 have to leave the nosec because they all have not enough player to be online 247 and protect again incomming cloakys and remember some gangs fly with 20 people around and leave a cloaked behindhow u deal with this  engage the 20 men with your 15 online peopleit is a failing of the cloaking mechanics how u deal with a cloaked ship there is now way for u to deal with it until he attackes u but he will not attack u when 20 other player onlinethe remove local or dealwith it or not blabla is all bullshita cloaky is a permanent threat for u and your member u never know when he is really playing or trying to find u in a site or something elsethere is no other tactic or something else that is a permant threat every tactic has a counter tactic but afkcloakybringasystemdownengangewhennobodyelseisonline has no countertacticso there has to be a way to engange him because of a space disruption after a long time or to prevent him from perma cloaking with fuelwhere is the problem with this ideas this kills just the overpowered afkpermathreat nothing moreall other tactics and uses of a cloaked ship will work as the do atmor are u afraid that u dont get any kills in the future   i think so
having killed ships drop all the loot instead of destroying part of it will have uninteded consiquences in eve every itemmodule has a descent chance of being destroyed in one way or another thats what keeps them valuable making it more likely for modules to drop makes modules in general less valuable if not because of a reduction in demand but because of an increase in supply i dont know what the long term affects would be but ccp needs to keep them in mind if they make a change like thatif you want people to go to low sec to make money then you need to make enough money available there where low sec profit isk income  ships lost is greater than high sec profit that number needs to be sufficiently higher such that the increase in cost after the pirates start building up to kill them does not push the low sec profit below high sec againthis all has to factor in the extra time required to be safe in low sec the effort of getting fleets together to watch your back or to give an extra share to your scout all of those come together such that low sec would require a several times increase in the payout from available income missions bounties mining anomoliessignatures etc before it became valuable
i have been going over these numbers a lot lately and yes thats basically itas you live in progressively more dangerous space you should make progressively more profit per hour or rather it should take you less time to grind up enough cash to get what you wantso if you were to say i am going to go ratting until i get enough to buy a drake it should take longer in highsec than lowsec and longer in lowsec than in nullsecnow as far as risk goes you always need to get more out of where you live than what you put into it so if you buy a 100 mil battleship or mining barge or whatever it needs to make you a little more than 100 mil back before it explodesi honestly think poco based sov is a good idea
